In Armenia Iphone is inly popular for fancy kids and adults who think that if they have phone that cost much they are cool
But techy kids like me or families that did not live in best conditions use android
For example I still use my Samsung galaxy S4
Got stuck in elevator
Like in 00s it was much because of old soviet elevators that worked their life and were in bad comdition but now it's less likely to happen
Are they mostly brown coloured
So there are the same elevators
Underpaid foreigner with accented English, making wine
Hayk for males
It's the name of founder of our nation
Anahit for female
it's the name of our gods in prechristian era
I personally don't know but it is possible because our cultures are very closed
Lile we have many similar words
Sometimes, my country is seen as nothing but a victim because of the Armenian genocide
Even though Armenian history is the definition of David vs Goliath
Nah it's still ok for me because I know that in July it will be from 40 to 45 and the hotest day was 35 degrees
In Armenia no one go topless in public
Maybe the problem is that we have very little amount of beaches
You can learn the grammar given enough effort
It's the pronunciation that's almost impossible to replicate unless you're a native speaker
There are also 2 letters/sounds that I haven't encountered in any other language
These are Ծ/ծ and Ճ/ճ․ I can't even put together combinations of letters in Latin to describe what it sounds like
The first is closest to "ts" but not quite
And the second to "tsh" but again, not quite the same
Grammar- hard
punctuation- ver much and not easy
Armenian is hard because of it is not so connected to any language and thrre is 39 letters which makes it even harder
Grammar is hard because of it's amount
It is easy to spot non native speaker
Even if you talk too much english then armenian some people can notice difference
I never saw/heard that anyone can speak fluent Armenian without being native speaker
Our current republic from the Russians
Armenia is a very old nation do not doubt it, however, Armenia was very close to extinction from the 14th-19th centuries
Eastern Armenia before the Russian conquest had over 117,000 non Armenian Muslims, which was 80% of the population at the time, the reason for this was the Timurid's scorched earth policy of depopulating places in the 16th century
This had resulted in almost 200-300,000 Armenians being deported, planting the seeds of our modern diaspora
This also discounting previous massacres in the 14th-15th centuries
The Russian Empire then took over the Erivan and Nachichevan Khanates from the Safavids in the 19th century, and then foresaw over 50,000 Muslims leave Armenia and had almost 40,000-50,000 Armenians return in just a decade or two
Not much bloodshed happened surprisingly, at least not yet
This had fundamentally created the modern Republic of Armenia, and in many ways, its neighboring Georgia and Azerbaijan
Drinking water fountains
It was the best thing during summer
Now you have to buy a plastic bottle and it is not as good as the old water
Folk music
I used to find it a bit uninteresting let's say, if not outright boring
But as I grew up and started appreciating our national customs more, folk music unexpectedly became quite a lot more enjoyable and even inspiring or soothing at times, depending on the particular song
The new Karabakh War has been raging since September, and the Armenian diaspora has been protesting for recognition of Artsakh/Karabakh
Nationalism is at a all time high, and families are scared of their children being lost
I fear the worst brother
Hippo
Litterally translating from Armenian word for Hippo means river horse
It's the 6th of January, here
However, less and less people are celebrating it in motherland Armenia
Diasporan armenians are still actively celebrating Christmas (Սուրբ Ծնունդ or Holy Birth) by going to church and visiting relatives
Onenof the Armenian assasins who tried to kill Ottoman Zsultan Abdul Hamid 2 died when he was testing grenades and that's not all
During the attempt of assasination the bomb explosive was bad quallity so it didn't reach sultan
I believe our current head of state, president Armen Sargsyan is second to no other, for us
A wise, balanced, and quite an active persona
The head of the government, Nikol Pashinyan, is really dedicated to fight corruption and establish a healthy law enforcement
Almost all of our current political issues have their root in former corrupt politicians and their oligarchy
Angela Merkel had visited Yerevan on 2018: she's a lovely persona
Our world definitely needs more of her type
Oh man, depending on where you lived prior to the Armenian genocide, you could have learned at the minimum, 3 languages to get by
Western Armenians in the 20th century, after the genocide, could have **spoken Kurdish, Turkish, Arabic and french all at the same time,** while Eastern Armenians would have only known Russian and Armenian
The average Armenian today would probably know, potentially four languages today (Armenian, English, Russian or french, Spanish Arabic, Turkish)
I myself am in a bit of a pickle as I feel overstretched at learning Armenian, Spanish and Russian
One of the best is "jump the river then say hop". It mean to your job then talk about it
As a sentient being, this sounds like cannibalism to me
That's exactly how the country is called in Armenian, Czechia (Չեխիա)
Indeed the Armenian language is written in the Armenian script, which was created about 1600 years ago, and is very loosely modeled after Greek, with some influence from Pahlavi and Syriac alphabets as well
[Here's an example
This is the alphabet with capital and small letters
] [Another example
] [And another one
For some reason I tend to forget that western Slavs use Latin instead of Cyrillic so I was slightly confused for a moment as for why you can't read it well :)
There are some example of handwritten text here:
One day, one of our homeboy kings Trdat lll of Armenia caught some *nasty* cold
Nothin, no one knew why he was bout to get **popped** with this flu
Then some guy called Gregory the Illuminator shows up, illuminatin our kingpin bout Christ's jizz and some Abrahamic guy called **God,** This guy had no name so he musta been ballin
Our homie thought that sounded like the jazz he groovin and made Armenia the first country to accept Christianity as state religion in 301 AD
You know it's pretty good to live near the country whoose nationalist want to slaughter you because you are Armenian
Blinding people with coal but in acient days
I don't how I only now the fact
Sorry
Our school uses MS Teams but when we wright control works we move to zoom
They justify it by saying that in zoom they see everyines cameras but in both platforms cheating is very easy
That straight men would walk hand in hand, especially during winter when it's cold, and kiss each other on the cheek but ain't gay
The Temple of Garni
Garegin Nzdeh -nationalist who fought against Soviets for Armenian southern part untel 1923
Axbyur Serop - hayduk(partizan) who fought against Turks
Aram Manukyan- hero of Van defence in 1915 and one of the leaders of Armenian govermeny in 1918
Andranik Ozanyan, Tovmas Nazarbekyan and Movses Silikyan- Generals who defend Armenia from Turkish invansion in 1918
Grigor Lusavorich- He spread christianity in Armenia
Hovhanes Bagramyan - red army general with armenian origin
Vardan Mamikonyan and his soldiers- they fought for independence from 450-451and sacrifice them in battle of Avarar in 451
Arkadi Ter Tadevosyan, Monte Melqonyan- leaders of the army in 1991 who fought against Azerbaijan for Karabakh
There are anothers too but they are most remembered ones
He too
We use something similar
"Ջանիդ մեռնեմ" - I would die on your body
I can't believe I fell for this
You just give money to driver
I would love to see the movie 300 be made under the context and support of how Armenia struggled to fight with the Sassinid Persians in the 5th century
We got Vardan the chad, the evil Persian king, a last but futile stand, seriously, its got everything going for it
Customs headquarters are in Gyumri(second biggest city), everything else is in Yerevan (capital)

Stop telling obvious fake stories man, there is no city called Bielefeld -_-
Most of our leaders in Armenian history have been pretty decent
Until we get to the 19-20th century
The most controversial leader we have is most definitely Garegin Nzdeh
He is in short, the biggest patriot in Armenian history
He brought back Armenian paganism, created an independent state in modern-day Syunik region of Armenia to free Armenia and an all around hero in for Armenians
He is also believed in Armenian superiority and probably justified genocide against the Turks
His ideals were pretty much on par with Hitler but more xenophobic to the outside world than a world conquering one
During the 1800s Russo-Turkish and Russo-Persian wars east Armenia got controled by Russians and many Armenians migrated from west Armenia to there so Armenia became the biggest city in the eastern Armenia which gained independance in 1918
r/askcaucasus
I miss seeing this in America
Someone who can express himself so clearly without any drama
Why wouldn’t you openly admit that you support him
You need to take that as a blessing
We have Trump
Apple can get an extension on this saying they need time to come up with a "solution". You're talking about a trillion dollar company
Their net worth is higher than some of these countries in the EU
You don't tell Apple what to do
They tell you what to do
Sorry but that's just how it is
They even make tax deals in the United States with the President
No, not only Trump
Obama too
Then in no time at all, boom, iPhones don't any charger plugs at all and it's wireless charging only being brave and all again
By the time everybody gets around to adopting a universal charger, wireless charging is going to be the norm
Not only wireless charging, but esim capability as well
Add to that rise of wireless earbuds and the phones in the future won't have any ports
You won
Supply and demand, my dear
What's heartbreaking is that even if you find the exact blueprint and rebuild it, it will never be the same again
It's like the Great Pyramids collapse and we just rebuild them again
So many people are complaining here about her age
Guys, age doesn't matter, young people can be good PMs too
That kid's face to the left
And also kessab,it's where i live,it's the only armenian town in the western armenia that is still majorly armenian
This is going to get downvoted to Hell, but I have to say it
To actually think that we as humans, even with all our "damaging" behaviors have any control over climate change is a FUCKING JOKE
This planet has been around for literally billions of years
It has gone through some shit in the process
Some major, major, MAJOR shit
We have 7 continents now
It wasn't always like that
We've had ice ages, heat waves, you name it
Some of these lasted for thousands of years, some hundreds
Now sure, we can try to change our ways as a society to help any way we can, but if you actually think that driving a Hybrid car or using less coal is what's going to help, you're not being realistic
One major volcano in the middle of the ocean erupting is equal to 20 years of car pollution, and those happen all the time
Not to mention the fact that if you look at the last say, 500 years, our society has gotten significantly better
People fail to compare what we used to do
It was a lot worse before
But I say it's all irrelevant on a big scale
The Earth is going through whatever it's going through
That's that
The Sun is ever so slowly expanding, etc etc etc
So many things happening at once
The worst thing that can happen to this planet in a few hundred years is humans, along with many other species, might simply die off
Maybe life itself
Perhaps it's meant to be
But enough of this "save the planet" shit
The planet will be fine
Your ass might die, though
Would I be wrong in saying that only the top of the building was really damaged
Lenin was a Tatar
You mean the great Armenian scientist, Nikol Teslayan
Those are some long hair
Well, Armenia may not have had anyone submit an Armenian version - but at least the shape of our country is almost exactly the same as the profile of the girl all over this map :)
You should be in Denmark
Thia is literally th 21st century and still people use vandalism and crimes to spread their idiologies
Humanity has so much work to do

That was not supposed to happen for another 2 months
I wonder how people around him reacted
As long as oil is cheap, flying is going to be affordable, especially within Europe
My personal opinion is that the US would be more political stable under a more Confederal system with greater independence to the states
The central government in DC has amassed a lot of power over the years, which has contributed to the political quagmire that it finds itself in
In such a case, the world would view the US even more as a union of states rather than one monolithic country
I think even now it is true
When it comes to the Coronavirus, the main deciders of policies were the states not so much the Federal Government
Some states have done much better than other states in their coronavirus policies, so it's hard to give an overall assessment when you have 50 different governments making different decisions and policies
Congrats from Armenia
Don't worry, Turkey is a democratic, NATO ally
What horrible times we are living in, if religious lunatics can kill you for making a joke
Жыве Беларусь!
We got rid of our dictator in Armenia
Not a single bullet was fired or any acts of violence by the people
I wish you luck Belarus, it’s possible
Slowly Putin is losing his control
All his dictator allies are losing power

Hey, congrats
Any post processing applied
Recession, here we come
I wonder what the impact is on the environment
This is just airplanes
Now imagine cars, motorcycles, trucks, boats, ships
we have a lot less than before
Also, less movement of people
Does this mean less pollution or on the contrary more pollution due to production of all that waste and plastic
I think corona js going to teach all of us a very valuable lesson
Too bad we had to learn it the hard way
I believe healthcare in the US needs to be approached at a state level, it's just too big and diverse of a country for a Federal solution to work properly
That being said, I don't expect the average American healthcare quality to ever match that of countries like Norway, which I believe is more a cultural/demographic issue than a policy issue
Hahaha wow
Talk about U.S. brainwashing
30 million people dead from the soviet side versus 500,000 Americans and U.S. did the most
Right then
Turkey: Commit another Genocide
Honestly you guys are such a mood
It has a lot to do with the post actually
It’s about what they’re thinking

Congrats, kaverukset
If it's a democratic government, it will easily be better than every government Russia has had in the past

“Barthelona”
Oh, I’m not typical at al
Probably because I’m from Barcelona
The small road is for bicycles
He hasn’t even done anything for the Armenians being killed by Muslims as we speak
What about bugs
You mean your bug
It reminds me of Copenhagen, very beautiful
My plan is to visit many cities in Europe
What’s Poland like
Tourist friendly
There are 2 kinds of men
This is incredible
I urge all who can to watch the movie The Promise, which tells a story against the backdrop of the Armenian Genocide
Our only hope is that Turkey can come to terms with its history and we can finally have some closure
To deny Genocide with the enthusiasm that the Turkish Government does is to put salt on a wound and make it worse
The official transcript of the verdict of the court martial conducted by the Ottoman Turkish government in 1919 against the perpetrators of the Armenian Genocide
It was first published in the Official Gazette (Takvim-i-Vekayi), No
3604
“Prime Minister Talat Pasha and Minister of War Enver Effendi, now expelled from his military career; Djemal Effendi, Minister of the Navy, likewise expelled from the service; Dr
Nazim, Minister of Education-these were the principal criminals (fayili asli) and their guilt has been determined by a unanimous vote
In accordance therefore with the abovementioned paragraphs in the law code, Talat, Enver, Djemal and Dr
Nazim are sentenced to death
July 5, 1919 (1335); Military Court: NAZIM; Head of the Secretariat empowered to Record the Minutes of this Military Tribunal: Abidin Daver; Official organ: No
3604
Published in the Official Gazette of Turkey (Takvimi Vekayi), no
3604 (supplement), July 22, 1919
Yom HaShoah day is different each year, as it goes according to the hebrew calendar
But it IS interestig how this year it fell on the same day as the Armenian Genocide remembrance day, as well as the Easter and Pesah this year
That kind of translates to "from now on, never" but Close enough
love the sentiment  <3
May be because the Turkish state sponsors genocide denial
i mean raphael lemkin, they guy the came up with the word genocide, based it off the armenian genocide and the holocaust so it literally is defined as a genocide
I'm guessing modern Turkey/Turks will find a much more amiable discussion partner if the democratically elected  Turkish state were to stop funding an official policy of denial which seeks to displace the work of a *vast majority* of Western scholars
Absolutely picturesque and beautiful
I absolutely love it, it's so gorgeous <3

What about Armenian
Yeah but
for the Brexit they pay just once
Bro, EU is sleeping on Bulgaria, soon to be a month with protests on the street vs the corrupt government and you expect it to care about non EU countries ?

Looks surreal
Very nice ️
Tfw Armenian :(
I feel ur pain bro
Pls send Dutch passport, I must've missed the memo
They’ll look up and shout, “save us”, and I’ll whisper, “no
I sincerely hope the Ukrainian authorities who orchestrated this know what the hell they're doing and the "larger plan" was worth it
Otherwise this will just be ammunition for Russian propaganda to say "See
The entire world was again quick to condemn us while we didn't even do anything
" and they'd be right
It's ok everyone
I'm evidence that they failed

Hm yeah that makes sense, but in any case this house may not be ideal for people that are sensitive to such swaying

> Most Armenians have black hair, tanned skin and long noses
Obviously some do, but saying most is disingenuous
We've a lot of variety of people looking south or eastern European honestly
Source: lived there and am one myself
That's one of my biggest gripes with this website as well, aye
It's honestly immature and childish by this point
> or cultural
We consider ourselves and our culture as aligning with that of Europe, tbh, so no, it fits
The EU and the UN do, along with a lot of other European people
Sorry, but your personal opinion doesn't really matter here in regards to this so
Unique snowflake etc etc
> Not really
The only reason why Europe wants any Transcaucasia nation in the EU is so they A) Don't align with Russia and B) Oil/Gas pipelines
I mean, no offence but you're not an EU official, so I'm not sure how accurate if a statement this may be
From all that has been displayed and expressed by this organization, the transcaucasian state's are considered European due to their historical and cultural presence and whatnot (I'm too tired to repeat them all again and again, sorry) throughout history, especially with Armenia and Georgia
> And I think we both realise that this subreddit has an extremely liberal definition of whats considered "Europe" - I think mostly due to the huge amount of non-Europeans commenting
Ehh, I wouldn't really say so
The view expressed in this server is, by and large from what I've seen in my travels through large parts of Europe, basically the accepted view of other Europeans (with the exception of Turkey, unfortunately)
You're expressing your opinion from a Danish perspective, so it's understandable why you'd say so, but the generally accepted opinion is that of what I've mentioned above
Holy lord, you need to chill, first off
Honestly I'm gonna stop talking cause you're being a bit too aggressive and offensive for no reason
Everything you said can be said against you as well, with you being very into pushing your belief that Armenia isn't European, or that you're clearly very butthurt about this, or just
Idk, flying off the handle like that
Calm down lol
We have something similar in Armenia
L&G meet "Liberator of Europe" Mr Stalin(sadly for lot of russians he is still a war hero and liberator)
Well unfortunately we don\`t learn about Warsaw uprising in Armenia
But instead we learn about "mighty " Elam and Babylon
well that\`s more important than one of the biggest tragedies in human history
Only because of excessive testing

why you do dis
This is terrible
Any reports on casualties ?
Just like VHS, our kids will not know what snow is
fuck
Aside from PR, what effect will this have
I think Puigdemont knew either way, he was going down, and thought, might as well go down as a martyr, so now Spain will establish direct rule, there will be some big protests in the meantime, Puigdemont will be hailed a 'hero', and thus his political reputation to some extent saved
Was it catholic or orthodox
Apostolic, closest to Orthodox
Europe's eastern borders are the Ural mountains and the Caucasus mountains
Armenia is south of the Caucasus, which is right outside the "geographic" boundaries of Europe, but it is too different culturally from Asia and North Africa/Middle East
The least conflicting argument is to say we are from the Caucasus region
Not inside the European continent, but with strong cultural and political relations to Europe
Read the guidelines of this subreddit, you will find an answer there I'm sure
Chemical analysis of the "holy Spears" around the world showed that only the one in Armenian Church possession is old enough though
Also imo, its the only one that looks like a roman soldiers spear from 2000 years back, and not some jewelry piece
Thank you
Exactly
You replied to a lot of comments on this thread, insisting on this same point
Are you Turkish by any chance
Yes, The HRE Holy Lance a beautiful art object but, obviously it has nothing to do with Jesus etc
After a little google search-
[Here are some roman spearheads for comparison
Looks like a roman spear to me tbh
Well, i cant really help you then
Maybe seek an optometrist

just WOW
Turkish and Azerbaijani propaganda machine is working 110% in this sub
I’ve always said the Caucasus are going to start WWIII
But seriously, thank you for posting this here and I’m just glad it’s getting attention
In all honesty, Turkey terrifies me a little
I don’t want my country to suffer another genocide
All we are doing is defending our people from a government that wants to—and has—harmed them
I know territorial integrity and all that is important, but Artsakh is different
Forget the “we were here first” arguments and all that for a moment
The fact is the Azerbaijani government had been killing Armenians and restricting their rights for years before Armenia stepped in
And now that things are getting bad again, the Azerbaijani government is restricting their own people’s internet access
They were the ones that decided to start a war in the middle of a pandemic, not us
This Reddit comment isn’t going to do anything, but I just want Armenians across the world to be able to live without fear
I don’t want my country to die
Turkey is already part of this conflict
The plane must have just fallen out of the sky on its own, then
I hope Turkey joins
They’re involved in every conflict in that region
It’s time they get a hard spanking that they’ll never forget
Because Turkey has an aggressive altitude toward a lot of countries
What else where Turkish F-16s stationed there for

VDB took the center and left which was enough to put him over the top
I think Austria in general has had a very reasonable foreign policy lately, balanced, good relations with East and West, and tough on Turkey as needed, so hopefully it continues
I think the Austrian Government took a very aggressive stance when it comes to Turkey and migrants, especially after the Presidential first round so that must have been a tactic to soothe the right-wing populist fervor
Will Van Der Bellen continue the same foreign policy, or become more anti-Russian and pro NATO ?

For example, life in Armenia is very cheap, so I guess it's relative
You get paid a lot in Switzerland but a Big Mac costs 12 euros, so this map doesn't provide the full picture
And in general, measures such as GDP per capita, net average monthly salary, etc are very tricky in nature
In Armenia Iphone is inly popular for fancy kids and adults who think that if they have phone that cost much they are cool
But techy kids like me or families that did not live in best conditions use android
For example I still use my Samsung galaxy S4
Got stuck in elevator
Like in 00s it was much because of old soviet elevators that worked their life and were in bad comdition but now it's less likely to happen

You can learn the grammar given enough effort
It's the pronunciation that's almost impossible to replicate unless you're a native speaker
There are also 2 letters/sounds that I haven't encountered in any other language
These are Ծ/ծ and Ճ/ճ․ I can't even put together combinations of letters in Latin to describe what it sounds like
The first is closest to "ts" but not quite
And the second to "tsh" but again, not quite the same
Grammar- hard
punctuation- ver much and not easy
Armenian is hard because of it is not so connected to any language and thrre is 39 letters which makes it even harder
Grammar is hard because of it's amount
It is easy to spot non native speaker
Even if you talk too much english then armenian some people can notice difference
I never saw/heard that anyone can speak fluent Armenian without being native speaker
Our current republic from the Russians
Armenia is a very old nation do not doubt it, however, Armenia was very close to extinction from the 14th-19th centuries
Eastern Armenia before the Russian conquest had over 117,000 non Armenian Muslims, which was 80% of the population at the time, the reason for this was the Timurid's scorched earth policy of depopulating places in the 16th century
This had resulted in almost 200-300,000 Armenians being deported, planting the seeds of our modern diaspora
This also discounting previous massacres in the 14th-15th centuries
The Russian Empire then took over the Erivan and Nachichevan Khanates from the Safavids in the 19th century, and then foresaw over 50,000 Muslims leave Armenia and had almost 40,000-50,000 Armenians return in just a decade or two
Not much bloodshed happened surprisingly, at least not yet
This had fundamentally created the modern Republic of Armenia, and in many ways, its neighboring Georgia and Azerbaijan
Drinking water fountains
It was the best thing during summer
Now you have to buy a plastic bottle and it is not as good as the old water
Folk music
I used to find it a bit uninteresting let's say, if not outright boring
But as I grew up and started appreciating our national customs more, folk music unexpectedly became quite a lot more enjoyable and even inspiring or soothing at times, depending on the particular song
The new Karabakh War has been raging since September, and the Armenian diaspora has been protesting for recognition of Artsakh/Karabakh
Nationalism is at a all time high, and families are scared of their children being lost
I fear the worst brother
Hippo
Litterally translating from Armenian word for Hippo means river horse
It's the 6th of January, here
However, less and less people are celebrating it in motherland Armenia
Diasporan armenians are still actively celebrating Christmas (Սուրբ Ծնունդ or Holy Birth) by going to church and visiting relatives
Onenof the Armenian assasins who tried to kill Ottoman Zsultan Abdul Hamid 2 died when he was testing grenades and that's not all
During the attempt of assasination the bomb explosive was bad quallity so it didn't reach sultan
I believe our current head of state, president Armen Sargsyan is second to no other, for us
A wise, balanced, and quite an active persona
The head of the government, Nikol Pashinyan, is really dedicated to fight corruption and establish a healthy law enforcement
Almost all of our current political issues have their root in former corrupt politicians and their oligarchy
Angela Merkel had visited Yerevan on 2018: she's a lovely persona
Our world definitely needs more of her type
Oh man, depending on where you lived prior to the Armenian genocide, you could have learned at the minimum, 3 languages to get by
Western Armenians in the 20th century, after the genocide, could have **spoken Kurdish, Turkish, Arabic and french all at the same time,** while Eastern Armenians would have only known Russian and Armenian
The average Armenian today would probably know, potentially four languages today (Armenian, English, Russian or french, Spanish Arabic, Turkish)
I myself am in a bit of a pickle as I feel overstretched at learning Armenian, Spanish and Russian
One of the best is "jump the river then say hop". It mean to your job then talk about it
As a sentient being, this sounds like cannibalism to me
That's exactly how the country is called in Armenian, Czechia (Չեխիա)
Indeed the Armenian language is written in the Armenian script, which was created about 1600 years ago, and is very loosely modeled after Greek, with some influence from Pahlavi and Syriac alphabets as well
[Here's an example
This is the alphabet with capital and small letters
] [Another example
] [And another one
For some reason I tend to forget that western Slavs use Latin instead of Cyrillic so I was slightly confused for a moment as for why you can't read it well :)
There are some example of handwritten text here:
One day, one of our homeboy kings Trdat lll of Armenia caught some *nasty* cold
Nothin, no one knew why he was bout to get **popped** with this flu
Then some guy called Gregory the Illuminator shows up, illuminatin our kingpin bout Christ's jizz and some Abrahamic guy called **God,** This guy had no name so he musta been ballin
Our homie thought that sounded like the jazz he groovin and made Armenia the first country to accept Christianity as state religion in 301 AD
You know it's pretty good to live near the country whoose nationalist want to slaughter you because you are Armenian
Blinding people with coal but in acient days
I don't how I only now the fact
Sorry
Our school uses MS Teams but when we wright control works we move to zoom
They justify it by saying that in zoom they see everyines cameras but in both platforms cheating is very easy
That straight men would walk hand in hand, especially during winter when it's cold, and kiss each other on the cheek but ain't gay

Garegin Nzdeh -nationalist who fought against Soviets for Armenian southern part untel 1923
Axbyur Serop - hayduk(partizan) who fought against Turks
Aram Manukyan- hero of Van defence in 1915 and one of the leaders of Armenian govermeny in 1918
Andranik Ozanyan, Tovmas Nazarbekyan and Movses Silikyan- Generals who defend Armenia from Turkish invansion in 1918
Grigor Lusavorich- He spread christianity in Armenia
Hovhanes Bagramyan - red army general with armenian origin
Vardan Mamikonyan and his soldiers- they fought for independence from 450-451and sacrifice them in battle of Avarar in 451
Arkadi Ter Tadevosyan, Monte Melqonyan- leaders of the army in 1991 who fought against Azerbaijan for Karabakh
There are anothers too but they are most remembered ones
He too
We use something similar
"Ջանիդ մեռնեմ" - I would die on your body
I can't believe I fell for this
You just give money to driver
I would love to see the movie 300 be made under the context and support of how Armenia struggled to fight with the Sassinid Persians in the 5th century
We got Vardan the chad, the evil Persian king, a last but futile stand, seriously, its got everything going for it
Customs headquarters are in Gyumri(second biggest city), everything else is in Yerevan (capital)

Stop telling obvious fake stories man, there is no city called Bielefeld -_-
Most of our leaders in Armenian history have been pretty decent
Until we get to the 19-20th century
The most controversial leader we have is most definitely Garegin Nzdeh
He is in short, the biggest patriot in Armenian history
He brought back Armenian paganism, created an independent state in modern-day Syunik region of Armenia to free Armenia and an all around hero in for Armenians
He is also believed in Armenian superiority and probably justified genocide against the Turks
His ideals were pretty much on par with Hitler but more xenophobic to the outside world than a world conquering one
During the 1800s Russo-Turkish and Russo-Persian wars east Armenia got controled by Russians and many Armenians migrated from west Armenia to there so Armenia became the biggest city in the eastern Armenia which gained independance in 1918

I miss seeing this in America
Someone who can express himself so clearly without any drama
Why wouldn’t you openly admit that you support him
You need to take that as a blessing
We have Trump
Apple can get an extension on this saying they need time to come up with a "solution". You're talking about a trillion dollar company
Their net worth is higher than some of these countries in the EU
You don't tell Apple what to do
They tell you what to do
Sorry but that's just how it is
They even make tax deals in the United States with the President
No, not only Trump
Obama too
Then in no time at all, boom, iPhones don't any charger plugs at all and it's wireless charging only being brave and all again
By the time everybody gets around to adopting a universal charger, wireless charging is going to be the norm
Not only wireless charging, but esim capability as well
Add to that rise of wireless earbuds and the phones in the future won't have any ports
You won
Supply and demand, my dear
What's heartbreaking is that even if you find the exact blueprint and rebuild it, it will never be the same again
It's like the Great Pyramids collapse and we just rebuild them again
So many people are complaining here about her age
Guys, age doesn't matter, young people can be good PMs too
That kid's face to the left
And also kessab,it's where i live,it's the only armenian town in the western armenia that is still majorly armenian
This is going to get downvoted to Hell, but I have to say it
To actually think that we as humans, even with all our "damaging" behaviors have any control over climate change is a FUCKING JOKE
This planet has been around for literally billions of years
It has gone through some shit in the process
Some major, major, MAJOR shit
We have 7 continents now
It wasn't always like that
We've had ice ages, heat waves, you name it
Some of these lasted for thousands of years, some hundreds
Now sure, we can try to change our ways as a society to help any way we can, but if you actually think that driving a Hybrid car or using less coal is what's going to help, you're not being realistic
One major volcano in the middle of the ocean erupting is equal to 20 years of car pollution, and those happen all the time
Not to mention the fact that if you look at the last say, 500 years, our society has gotten significantly better
People fail to compare what we used to do
It was a lot worse before
But I say it's all irrelevant on a big scale
The Earth is going through whatever it's going through
That's that
The Sun is ever so slowly expanding, etc etc etc
So many things happening at once
The worst thing that can happen to this planet in a few hundred years is humans, along with many other species, might simply die off
Maybe life itself
Perhaps it's meant to be
But enough of this "save the planet" shit
The planet will be fine
Your ass might die, though
Would I be wrong in saying that only the top of the building was really damaged
Lenin was a Tatar
You mean the great Armenian scientist, Nikol Teslayan
Those are some long hair
Well, Armenia may not have had anyone submit an Armenian version - but at least the shape of our country is almost exactly the same as the profile of the girl all over this map :)
You should be in Denmark
Thia is literally th 21st century and still people use vandalism and crimes to spread their idiologies
Humanity has so much work to do
Trees are starting to bloom
That was not supposed to happen for another 2 months
I wonder how people around him reacted
As long as oil is cheap, flying is going to be affordable, especially within Europe
My personal opinion is that the US would be more political stable under a more Confederal system with greater independence to the states
The central government in DC has amassed a lot of power over the years, which has contributed to the political quagmire that it finds itself in
In such a case, the world would view the US even more as a union of states rather than one monolithic country
I think even now it is true
When it comes to the Coronavirus, the main deciders of policies were the states not so much the Federal Government
Some states have done much better than other states in their coronavirus policies, so it's hard to give an overall assessment when you have 50 different governments making different decisions and policies
Congrats from Armenia
Don't worry, Turkey is a democratic, NATO ally
What horrible times we are living in, if religious lunatics can kill you for making a joke
Жыве Беларусь!
We got rid of our dictator in Armenia
Not a single bullet was fired or any acts of violence by the people
I wish you luck Belarus, it’s possible
Slowly Putin is losing his control
All his dictator allies are losing power

Hey, congrats
Any post processing applied
Recession, here we come
I wonder what the impact is on the environment
This is just airplanes
Now imagine cars, motorcycles, trucks, boats, ships
we have a lot less than before
Also, less movement of people
Does this mean less pollution or on the contrary more pollution due to production of all that waste and plastic
I think corona js going to teach all of us a very valuable lesson
Too bad we had to learn it the hard way
I believe healthcare in the US needs to be approached at a state level, it's just too big and diverse of a country for a Federal solution to work properly
That being said, I don't expect the average American healthcare quality to ever match that of countries like Norway, which I believe is more a cultural/demographic issue than a policy issue
Hahaha wow
Talk about U.S. brainwashing
30 million people dead from the soviet side versus 500,000 Americans and U.S. did the most
Right then
Turkey: Commit another Genocide
Honestly you guys are such a mood
It has a lot to do with the post actually
It’s about what they’re thinking

Congrats, kaverukset
If it's a democratic government, it will easily be better than every government Russia has had in the past

What is he actually saying
Russia looks sexy
“Barthelona”
Oh, I’m not typical at al
Probably because I’m from Barcelona
The small road is for bicycles
He hasn’t even done anything for the Armenians being killed by Muslims as we speak
What about bugs
You mean your bug
It reminds me of Copenhagen, very beautiful
My plan is to visit many cities in Europe
What’s Poland like
Tourist friendly
There are 2 kinds of men
This is incredible
I urge all who can to watch the movie The Promise, which tells a story against the backdrop of the Armenian Genocide
Our only hope is that Turkey can come to terms with its history and we can finally have some closure
To deny Genocide with the enthusiasm that the Turkish Government does is to put salt on a wound and make it worse
The official transcript of the verdict of the court martial conducted by the Ottoman Turkish government in 1919 against the perpetrators of the Armenian Genocide
It was first published in the Official Gazette (Takvim-i-Vekayi), No
3604
“Prime Minister Talat Pasha and Minister of War Enver Effendi, now expelled from his military career; Djemal Effendi, Minister of the Navy, likewise expelled from the service; Dr
Nazim, Minister of Education-these were the principal criminals (fayili asli) and their guilt has been determined by a unanimous vote
In accordance therefore with the abovementioned paragraphs in the law code, Talat, Enver, Djemal and Dr
Nazim are sentenced to death
July 5, 1919 (1335); Military Court: NAZIM; Head of the Secretariat empowered to Record the Minutes of this Military Tribunal: Abidin Daver; Official organ: No

Published in the Official Gazette of Turkey (Takvimi Vekayi), no
3604 (supplement), July 22, 1919
Yom HaShoah day is different each year, as it goes according to the hebrew calendar
But it IS interestig how this year it fell on the same day as the Armenian Genocide remembrance day, as well as the Easter and Pesah this year
That kind of translates to "from now on, never" but Close enough
love the sentiment  <3
May be because the Turkish state sponsors genocide denial
i mean raphael lemkin, they guy the came up with the word genocide, based it off the armenian genocide and the holocaust so it literally is defined as a genocide
I'm guessing modern Turkey/Turks will find a much more amiable discussion partner if the democratically elected  Turkish state were to stop funding an official policy of denial which seeks to displace the work of a *vast majority* of Western scholars
Absolutely picturesque and beautiful
I absolutely love it, it's so gorgeous <3

What about Armenian
Yeah but
for the Brexit they pay just once
Bro, EU is sleeping on Bulgaria, soon to be a month with protests on the street vs the corrupt government and you expect it to care about non EU countries ?

Looks surreal
Very nice ️
Tfw Armenian :(
I feel ur pain bro
Pls send Dutch passport, I must've missed the memo
They’ll look up and shout, “save us”, and I’ll whisper, “no
I sincerely hope the Ukrainian authorities who orchestrated this know what the hell they're doing and the "larger plan" was worth it
Otherwise this will just be ammunition for Russian propaganda to say "See
The entire world was again quick to condemn us while we didn't even do anything
" and they'd be right
It's ok everyone
I'm evidence that they failed

This is a city from Game of Thrones and that’s a dragon

Ayy I would get seasick from that
Hm yeah that makes sense, but in any case this house may not be ideal for people that are sensitive to such swaying
For all my bros in Cyprus and Greece, we share your pain, love and support from Armenia

Oh he is
We've already charged and prosecuted a few of the most blatantly corrupt mayors and businessmen, and we're heading for the rest as Well
We're also getting along with the creation of reforms for the election process

> Most Armenians have black hair, tanned skin and long noses
Obviously some do, but saying most is disingenuous
We've a lot of variety of people looking south or eastern European honestly
Source: lived there and am one myself
That's one of my biggest gripes with this website as well, aye
It's honestly immature and childish by this point
> or cultural
We consider ourselves and our culture as aligning with that of Europe, tbh, so no, it fits
The EU and the UN do, along with a lot of other European people
Sorry, but your personal opinion doesn't really matter here in regards to this so
Unique snowflake etc etc
> Not really
The only reason why Europe wants any Transcaucasia nation in the EU is so they A) Don't align with Russia and B) Oil/Gas pipelines
I mean, no offence but you're not an EU official, so I'm not sure how accurate if a statement this may be
From all that has been displayed and expressed by this organization, the transcaucasian state's are considered European due to their historical and cultural presence and whatnot (I'm too tired to repeat them all again and again, sorry) throughout history, especially with Armenia and Georgia
> And I think we both realise that this subreddit has an extremely liberal definition of whats considered "Europe" - I think mostly due to the huge amount of non-Europeans commenting
Ehh, I wouldn't really say so
The view expressed in this server is, by and large from what I've seen in my travels through large parts of Europe, basically the accepted view of other Europeans (with the exception of Turkey, unfortunately)
You're expressing your opinion from a Danish perspective, so it's understandable why you'd say so, but the generally accepted opinion is that of what I've mentioned above
Holy lord, you need to chill, first off
Honestly I'm gonna stop talking cause you're being a bit too aggressive and offensive for no reason
Everything you said can be said against you as well, with you being very into pushing your belief that Armenia isn't European, or that you're clearly very butthurt about this, or just
Idk, flying off the handle like that
Calm down lol
We have something similar in Armenia
L&G meet "Liberator of Europe" Mr Stalin(sadly for lot of russians he is still a war hero and liberator)
Well unfortunately we don\`t learn about Warsaw uprising in Armenia
But instead we learn about "mighty " Elam and Babylon
well that\`s more important than one of the biggest tragedies in human history
Only because of excessive testing
Erdogan's project on Turkey

When there is war, there are weapon sellers
And today, I decided to be a weapon seller
why you do dis
This is terrible
Any reports on casualties ?
Just like VHS, our kids will not know what snow is
fuck
Aside from PR, what effect will this have
I think Puigdemont knew either way, he was going down, and thought, might as well go down as a martyr, so now Spain will establish direct rule, there will be some big protests in the meantime, Puigdemont will be hailed a 'hero', and thus his political reputation to some extent saved
Was it catholic or orthodox
Apostolic, closest to Orthodox
Europe's eastern borders are the Ural mountains and the Caucasus mountains
Armenia is south of the Caucasus, which is right outside the "geographic" boundaries of Europe, but it is too different culturally from Asia and North Africa/Middle East
The least conflicting argument is to say we are from the Caucasus region
Not inside the European continent, but with strong cultural and political relations to Europe
Read the guidelines of this subreddit, you will find an answer there I'm sure
Chemical analysis of the "holy Spears" around the world showed that only the one in Armenian Church possession is old enough though
Also imo, its the only one that looks like a roman soldiers spear from 2000 years back, and not some jewelry piece
Thank you
Exactly
You replied to a lot of comments on this thread, insisting on this same point
Are you Turkish by any chance
Yes, The HRE Holy Lance a beautiful art object but, obviously it has nothing to do with Jesus etc
After a little google search-
[Here are some roman spearheads for comparison
Looks like a roman spear to me tbh
Well, i cant really help you then
Maybe seek an optometrist
Wish we had a president named "Slob"

Wow
just WOW
Turkish and Azerbaijani propaganda machine is working 110% in this sub
I’ve always said the Caucasus are going to start WWIII
But seriously, thank you for posting this here and I’m just glad it’s getting attention
In all honesty, Turkey terrifies me a little
I don’t want my country to suffer another genocide
All we are doing is defending our people from a government that wants to—and has—harmed them
I know territorial integrity and all that is important, but Artsakh is different
Forget the “we were here first” arguments and all that for a moment
The fact is the Azerbaijani government had been killing Armenians and restricting their rights for years before Armenia stepped in
And now that things are getting bad again, the Azerbaijani government is restricting their own people’s internet access
They were the ones that decided to start a war in the middle of a pandemic, not us
This Reddit comment isn’t going to do anything, but I just want Armenians across the world to be able to live without fear
I don’t want my country to die
Turkey is already part of this conflict
The plane must have just fallen out of the sky on its own, then
I hope Turkey joins
They’re involved in every conflict in that region
It’s time they get a hard spanking that they’ll never forget
Because Turkey has an aggressive altitude toward a lot of countries
What else where Turkish F-16s stationed there for
To deliver flowers
You didn’t have to be a rocket scientist to see this coming

I think the FPÖ would have won if they would have brought forth a bit more moderate candidate
VDB took the center and left which was enough to put him over the top
I think Austria in general has had a very reasonable foreign policy lately, balanced, good relations with East and West, and tough on Turkey as needed, so hopefully it continues
I think the Austrian Government took a very aggressive stance when it comes to Turkey and migrants, especially after the Presidential first round so that must have been a tactic to soothe the right-wing populist fervor
Will Van Der Bellen continue the same foreign policy, or become more anti-Russian and pro NATO ?

It's giving me headache at work

Turkey is literally treating them like a bitch and this woman isn’t doing a thing about it
How is Turkey higher than Russia
poor russia
Or, UK is just being a piece of shit since as we speak Turkey along with Azerbaijan are killing Armenias and UK supports them
As far as I remember, literacy of Armenians in 1900s in Ottoman Empire was around 80%, according to some Bulgarian census (?)

For example, life in Armenia is very cheap, so I guess it's relative
You get paid a lot in Switzerland but a Big Mac costs 12 euros, so this map doesn't provide the full picture
And in general, measures such as GDP per capita, net average monthly salary, etc are very tricky in nature
