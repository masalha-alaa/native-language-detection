In Canada when they started construction the Western Canadian portion of the Canadian Pacific Railway, it was cheaper and easier to get Chinese labour from Hong Kong than from Halifax
Of the 9,000 railway workers, 6,500 were Chinese Canadians
They were paid $1
00 a day and had to pay for food and gear from that salary
White workers were paid $1
50-$2
50 a day and did not have to pay for food and gear
As well as being paid less, Chinese workers were given the most dangerous tasks, such as handling the explosive nitroglycerin used to break up solid rock
Due to the harsh conditions they faced, hundreds of Chinese Canadians working on the railway died from accidents, winter cold, illness and malnutrition
In the iconic historic photograph of CPR Director Donald Alexander Smith driving the ceremonial “last spike,” when the western and eastern sections of the CPR finally met in Craigellachie, British Columbia, all of the Chinese Canadian workers were cleared from view
My great grandfather and his first born son was executed by the partisans for selling meat to an Italian soldier to feed his family of 7
While I agree with the sentiment, I don't see how such a policy could be fairly implemented
I would not trust any organization enough to allow them the power to *sterilize* someone
Any such system carries much too great of a risk of bad actors co-opting it to just begin sterilizing what they consider to be "undesirables
It is far better to leave this up to personal choice, and instead focus on removing the current access barriers we have on sex ed and birth control
No relation
But I can imagine a lot would have fled at that time
I trust the state, sure
But do I trust them to *sterilize* the population
That's one hell of a power they would be given
You claimed yourself that sterilizing autistic people and people with Down Syndrome wouldn't be moral, yet that's what the *trustworthy* state did 30 years ago
Another Finland user in this thread claimed that Finland was ranked to be the most racist country of the EU
I don't know how legitimate the claim is, but if there is any bit of legitimacy to it, I wouldn't trust the country to decide who can and can't reproduce
Take Canada for example, I don't think it has the reputation of a a particularly racist country, but the government forcibly sterilized native women up until the 70s (and approximately 100 women claim to have been forcibly sterilized since the 70s, still) because it was for **"their own good"**.
I would, to some degree, trust our *current* state to handle this, but I probably would've said the same of the US 10-15 years ago
It's too much for me to say I can trust any organization in perpetuity
And there's a large movement against such things for good reason
Putting aside whether the punishment is effective or ethical, mistakes in the criminal system are unfortunately common and to some degree inevitable - our society is in a good enough position to be able to say, "we can afford to keep such people locked up rather than risk killing any innocents
>For the same reason we **allow** teen pregnancy to be terminated, we allow this form of termination
Notice how you wrote **allow** instead of **force**. Unless you're advocating for forced abortions on teenagers, too
You say that, but the various atrocities committed and being committed across the globe, many in nations that *ought* to be past such things, proves that wrong
I thought the question was about the death penalty
For that, there's strong movements against it - hence why more and more states have followed much of the rest of the developed world in removing the death penalty
If you don't think such movements exist, I think you should be looking at yourself first here before claiming that "It only exists in your [echo] chambers
And on a different note, are we *really* comparing people with "undesirable traits" to *criminals*? That's exactly the slippery slope that I'm pointing out is problematic
>Because you focus on some random detail of my post, you missed the point
I'm discussing the "dark" morality he tries to picture
I didn't focus on a random detail of your post, I focused on a detail that, for me, invalidates your argument
Just because we allow teens to have abortions doesn't mean we should forcibly sterilize the disabled
I got your point just fine and I agree: non-autonomous people shouldn't be in charge of a less autonomous being
I disagree with you solution
I agree that I should remove the weeds of my front yard, but I won't advocate for setting my yard on fire to get rid of it
> There are many cases where people do not have the right to dispose of their body
Prisoners and psychiatric cases for example
It's always in the case of protecting a 3rd party
Jailing criminals isn't always to protect a 3rd party
It can also be a form a retribution, justice some may call it
In the best of cases, it is for rehabilitation but jail isn't really the best place for that anyway
I still think the analogy is off
You jail someone *for an action they did*. We are discussing sterilizing someone *for the way they are born*. I don't understand how you see them on equal grounds
u/80sBabyGirl already mentioned how your argument is a better push for birth control than for forced sterilization
The former is, to me, a more sensible solution
The latter is way too extreme for my taste
>You could even make a good case that having children at all is morally questionable
Indeed
Although I made the decision to have a child myself, I realise I did bring a new person in a world of limited resources
>Just like a vegetarian would be wrong to force people to stop eating meat
This is a very good analogy
Well done
Okay, there's a number of separate things here, which I will tackle independently
1) Death penalty, forced sterilization of criminals
Hence, that's why I said
> our society is in a good enough position to be able to say, "we can afford to keep such people locked up rather than risk killing any innocents
I agree; some, if not many, societies in the world aren't in such a position
That's not relevant though, since we *are*. There is no need to risk causing that degree of permanent harm to innocents
2) Comparison of "intellectually disabled people" as 'undesirables' in a similar manner to criminals
Our discussions started about "intellectually disabled people
It was mentioned that "forced sterilization of intellectually disabled people was a very common thing"
When I argued why that ought not to be a thing, you said,
> We sterilize rapist
and then
> You missed the point
You claim we should leave it up for people to decide
Well, people in jail do not decide for themselves how they dispose of their body
That is, you're *directly* comparing "intellectually disabled people" to *criminals*. This is what I have issue with; are you *seriously* arguing that "if you're fine with the government sterilizing rapists (which I'm not, for reasons mentioned above), then you ought to be fine with the government sterilizing what they deem 'intellectually disabled' people"?
To put it a more obvious way, "let's sterilize what we've arbitrarily deemed 'undesirables' based off who they are rather than what they've done" - sound familiar
Seems like we hit Godwin's law now
I mean
gas is cheap as hell
And I mean I can get a bag of chips and it’s still more expensive than a few litres of gas
Bit late to party, but I had a nightmare/dream recently that got me interested in the Swiss system, by my understanding is nobody can do it for you, they assist you with obtaining drugs and applying an IV if that's the way, but administering is completely on you
Correct me if I'm wrong
In Belgium, does one do it themselves or have it done for them
In my Canada we're currently deliberating how to write the law about it after our Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional to not allow assisted dying
The only condition I'd think in my current mind I'd want to kill myself is if I became quadraplegic and could not use my arms at all, being assisted by a person and/or breathing into a tube to move my wheelchair and type on a screen
That I'm sure I don't want
But a quadriplegic can't physically kill themselves, so in Belgium (and Swiss, if I'm wrong on my understanding) be able to have someone do it for them or would they be trapped in a wheelchair
Also, in Canada it appears we are headed to terminally ill and chronic never ending pain, excluding mental issues
So if someone is otherwise physically healthy and not in pain, but can't live a life because paralyzed from neck down, Canada appears they wouldn't allow it, with the way the legislation appears it's going
That's incredibly depressing and probably the most likely scenario
I remember doing research on that conflict in English class in grade 12
We read a short story and then did a research assessment on Ireland during the war
The story was about a sharpshooter scouting on some rooftops, and ends up killing another soldier, who he later finds out was his brother
A very well written, yet sad story
They did your boy dirty he was a fucking beast
If I remember correctly, I think it was after the 2nd partition, there was a civil war, Russia invaded, then the poles started WINNING against the Russians, then the government said “Fuck it” and forced the Poles to surrender, which lead to the 3rd partition
YouTuber “Rare Earth” did a small set of mini documentaries on Albania, focusing on the last half century
Damn Ireland really be [like]

The European  Union commissioners  have announced  that agreement  has
been reached to adopt English  as the preferred language for  European
communications, rather than German,  which was the other  possibility
As  part  of  the  negotiations,  the British government conceded that
English spelling  had some  room for  improvement and  has accepted  a
five-year phased plan for what will be known as EuroEnglish (Euro  for
short)
In  the  first  year,  "s"  will  be  used  instead  of  the soft "c".
Sertainly, sivil servants will resieve this news with joy
Also,  the
hard  "c"  will  be  replaced  with  "k".  Not only will this klear up
konfusion, but typewriters kan have one less letter
There will be growing publik  enthusiasm in the sekond year,  when the
troublesome "ph" will  be replaced by  "f". This will  make words like
"fotograf" 20 per sent shorter
In  the  third  year,  publik  akseptanse  of  the new spelling kan be
expekted  to  reach  the  stage  where  more  komplikated  changes are
possible
Governments  will enkorage  the removal  of double  letters,
which have  always ben  a deterent  to akurate  speling
Also,  al wil
agre  that  the  horible  mes  of  silent  "e"s  in  the  languag   is
disgrasful, and they would go
By the fourth year, peopl wil  be reseptiv to steps such as  replasing
"th" by z" and "w" by " v".
During  ze  fifz  year,  ze  unesesary  "o"  kan  be  dropd from vords

When I lived in Holland I could hear who learned English primarily in school (British accent) vs TV / movies (American accent)
Interestingly, I had friends then from Dutch Caribbean islands that had a very clear "Caribbean" accent while speaking their native Dutch
That is they used the same sounds I would hear from English speaking Caribbean countries
Can you pronounce the Dutch town "[Scheveningen]
I'm an English speaking Canadian who lived in Holland for a couple years and Scheveningen was a word that I couldn't pronounce
Apparently it was a secret word to tell German spies from Dutch nationals in WW2 because Germans can't pronounce it either
Why is Android more popular in Europe than North America
Back when I was in high school, basically everyone had iphones
It was really only the techky kids who were more interested in specs that had androids
The exception was the international kids (mostly from Germany, Italy and Spain)
A good chunk of them had android phones (maybe like 50%)
And I don't think that it was really because of price because most of these kids came from pretty well off families as it costs like 30k to do an exchange
But digging into the numbers ([source] it seems like it seems to be the case that android is more popular in Europe than NA
NA is about 55% to 45%, whereas Europe is about 70 to 30
Sure there are some countries that aren't doing too well in Europe but even in the rich European countries like Germany and France, there are a lot more androids than iphones
The only countries I saw with more iphones than androids were the UK and Norway (though there could be others though as I didn't check every country)
So is there any particular reason for these differences
Gay to have an iPhone
Wow, I’ve seen it all now
but do windows computers and androids even connect to each other
I've never heard of anything that connects them
So even if you had a macbook and a samsung galaxy (or vice versa), wouldn't you basically be getting the same experience as two non-apple devices
We don’t just use iMessage you know
a lot of people use Facebook messenger
In fact, from my experience, everyone I talk to is through FB and not iMessage, even though all my friends have Apple
The way I see it is that with iPhones, you know what your getting
A pretty decent phone that is basically guaranteed to work for 95% of the things you need to do
Whereas androids can be more hit and miss
Yeah you get what you pay for and you can't really compare a $200 android to an iphone or a $1000 android
But at the same time, apps are generally designed with iphones in mind and are optimized better for them and its hard to make a well-optimized app for the hundreds of different androids
I think huawei phones are sold in the US its just he 5g infrastructure that has been banned
Also I think that when americans do buy androids they tend to buy from the well established brands like samsung and not so much the new chinese brands like huawei and xaomi
Maybe its because there is more anti-china rhetoric and korean brands are preferred but idk
wait so are you guys still using windows phones
Its not cheaper
Its usually slightly more expensive (like $15 to $50) compared to buying from the apple store
>Wait, so iPhone is more popular in the US fhan Samsung Galaxy Note, for example
Oh yeah 100%.  Well I cant really speak for the US (but would assume that its similar)
I dont think most people would be able to differentiate a note from any other android
Well maybe they could back when the note first came out because samsung marketed like crazy and it was way bigger than any other phone and had a stylus, but nowadays, i cant remember the last time ive seen a note
(the last time I can think of was a demo in a store when the note 2 came out)
Why would you need three different SIM cards tho
>i personaly only know one phone manufacturer that makes IOS devices
unless you are referring to the various chinese companies that actually build the iphones, yeah apple is the only manufacturer of ios devices
>Now this is the perspective from someone in their final year of high school
(Everyone is  between the ages 18-20)
Kinda off topic but is it normal to have a lot of 20 year olds still in high school
Or is it just people taking a victory lap and people who may have failed a few classes
Or do you guys have the first year of what would be college for us complete in high school
Here it would be incredibly rare for a 20 year old to still be in high school and if they were, there are usually special courses that adults would take (like night courses)
For reference, i'm only 19 and about to start my 3rd year of university in september
Personally I have the opposite experience
>No headphone jack, because
I think that theres a little bit more to it than that
The trend is going more towards wireless headphones so eventually, wired headphones wont be necessary for most people
Removing the headphone jack also frees up space that can be used for other hardware
And removing the jack doesn't mean that you can't use wired headphones, you just need to have an adapter (which comes in the box)
And many android manufacturers are following apple in doing so too
maybe its not so much of a status symbol but more of an expectation and if you have an android its sort of looked down on
Well it’s like any other status symbol really
Why would someone spend $300 on a Gucci belt when you can get a non-brand name belt that could look just as good and of similar or better quality for a fraction of a price
Ohh I thought you meant three sims on one phone
They had their original SE which was basically an iphone 5s on the outside
Well yeah, but the same could be said about any other status symbol
It’s not so much (at least here) having an iPhone says “I’m rich” but not having one sort of says “I’m poor”
It’s kinda weird
Kinda off topic but do you know why some phones come with multiple SIM card slots
Never really made sense to me

> Restaurants are always focused on rushing people in and out rather than the enjoyment of the guests
Less time spent talking at the table European-style by the customers means the same table can sit more groups of customers, which means more profit for the restaurant
It's about the throughput and efficiency
Plus more customers means more tips for the waiters, which is essential to their income
As in Czech soldiers buried in Russian cemeteries

But don’t the people with excellent healthcare through their employers worry about their fellow citizens who don’t?   I wouldn’t want excellent healthcare through my employer if it meant my neighbour who works at company X might not
I’d be ashamed that he didn’t get the same amount of a basic human right as me
It would be like if I got police protection through my employer, but I watched my neighbour get mugged and couldn’t do anything
Or if I got my firefighters through my employer, but I watched my neighbour’s house burns down
I would just feel so helpless
Almost half my salary, because I am reasonably well paid, goes to taxes
Those taxes make our budget big enough to take care of all the lazy undisciplined people

Here in canada, the further sough you go I find the more bottled or purified fridge water you find
The justification for it
“We don’t want to drink water that runoff from mins and stuff”. Where might the majority of mines in the province be you ask
About 600-900km straight north with no direct link to their water source
I’ve never understood drinking only bottled water
Unless a local government is extremely negligent it should be very very safe

I’m native Québécois Francophone and I can tell you that I had to make some efforts to understand what they were saying
They both have a really old school/regional French
actually, it’s technically not an english accent- apparently the québec french accent is the closest accent to 16th/17th century french, since the colony was so isolated from the rest of the world haha
but yeah, on top of that québec french is like 10% normal words 90% slang
The same shit in Québec, Canada Sometimes it could be changed to "working at a Belle Province" (a Québec fast food restaurant)

On 9 December 1917 two ships collided in Halifax harbour and one of those ships had explosives onboard
Everything within an 800 m radius was completely destroyed, over 9 000 people were injured, 2 000 people killed
The explosion also created a tsunami
It was the worlds most powerful man made explosion ever recorder (pre-nuclear)
It’s called the Halifax Explosion
French here :
During the Revolution, there was a major counter-revolution orchestrated by the royalists in Vendée. The newly formed Republic then sent an expedition to this region
But they didn't just take back control, they **obliterated** the entire region, especially with the infamous "Colonnes Infernales" (aka the Infernal columns)
What happened to the land there is unimaginable, as this wasn't just like a Viking-like raid (pillage and burn), this was a methodical devastation of a "threat to the Republic".
Edit :
Those divisions were called "Infernal columns" for a good reason
The Republicans soldiers marched in tight columns led by drummers which had (allegedly) lit their drums on fire (or at least the drumsticks) and they had one mission : Burn all the shit they encountered to the ground
Un des mes ancêtres, Jean-Jacques Goullin, est un des responsables majeurs de ces noyades
As I said in French in one of my other comments, one of my ancestors, Jean-Jacques Goullin, was the right arm of the dude responsible of all the massacres in the city of Nantes
They would celebrate something called "marriage républicain" (républicain wedding) : You strip naked a noble man and woman, tie them together and throw them in the sea while yelling "Vive les mariés !" meaning "Long live the married !"
We like to take credit for that, since Americans always crap on us

I’m in Canada so I don’t know my schnitzel the way an Austrian would
My first impression is that the flavours of a sauce make it very tempting, but adding a liquid might destroy the texture of schnitzel, which is crisp perfection already and should not be tampered with
If I did this I think the sauce would have to be served separately and I could only dip the cut edge of the meat into it

France sure is present in the news here in Québec even though we're an ocean apart, but it's mostly when something big is happening
Because in the end, french politics have absolutely no influence over what's happening here
We get a lot more news from the RoC and the US on that front
Canadian here
Can’t help but feel like this question was written for us
Chiming in as a non-european
Canadians definitely find themselves in a similar position
Most of our media is american, sometimes to the point where people will know more about what's happening down south than about what's happening in their own provinces
We have a law that limits american ads on cable tv
It was instituted because previously american ads were flooding our television broadcasts
This was done to help out Canadian businesses
It always becomes a hot button issue around the super bowl because of how good those ads are
I personally believe Canada is just always in the awkward position of hanging on to the British realm while being groomed by america
We definitely get the same effect here aswell
I rarely hear about anything internationally
All it is currently is election horse shit
I hardly know whats happening in my own country and even then I have to look it up online
I specifically follow some foreign news stations that have english sections to get away from it all, like NHK Japan on twitter
Twitters also bad with it "Trending Page" so I set that to a language I I don't read
Not sure if this is sarcasm so I’ll do my best
Ninety percent of Canadians live within 100 miles (160km) of the US border
95+% of Canadian media, movies, TV, music and content comes out of the US
More than 50% of our news is about the US and if that more than half of the news we watch is from US stations like CNN or similar
While this question was pointed at Europeans I fully expect Canada is one of the single most influenced by a bigger neighbours news affected countries in the world

I’m Canadian and speak French quite well
I was at a hostel in Australia, and two French guys were sitting there going around the room talking about each of the girls in French
This was after we had all chatted about where we were from and there were no other people from France
They were saying things like “oh yeah, she’s hot
eh, she’s not the prettiest” etc
When they got around to me and said they thought I was good looking I said “oh merci, les gars”, and they were thoroughly embarrassed that I had been listening in the whole time
I guess they forgot other people speak French too
I play scopa with my Nonna here in Canada all the time

yep thats about how my scale goes, except i dont even gove going outside a second thought until -40
As a Canadian, I second this .
Canadian here, I know it sounds weird, but Chirstmas decorations (namely Christmas lights) help make winter a lot more tolerable
Yeah there’s less sunlight, but that just means more opportunities to see the pretty Christmas lights at night
Aside from that, remembering to stay social with friends and loved ones, and finding hobbies that can be done indoors from the comfort of a comfortable couch/bed under a cozy blanket helps make things more bearable
Also picking up a winter sport to stay active, but I’m not sure how much snow Aus gets so I’m not sure how possible that last tip is
In Canada we also have smoked tuna (on the Pacific Coast), which is absolutely amazing
Just give it a few years

So I was reading this thread and super surprised to see you all counting the cost of LEGO sets in the *hundreds* of Euros range
But then I checked online here and saw that sets in Canada also go for up to $400 Canadian, which completely blew my mind

Ah alright
In Canada we had a very similar situation as the Aussies
Aboriginal children kidnapped from their homes and sent to residential schools with really shitty conditions
They were taught “how to act white” and would basically be doomed to live on the streets the rest of their lives, suffer immense emotional trauma and would never be able to contact their family ever again
The last of these residential schools closed in 1989 I believe
Usually the children were taken if the native family lived too close to an area that was starting to industrialize
That would be the Holocaust

I mean, a lot of countries just gave up as quickly to avoid more costly engagements
It can be argued he saved lives by surrendering sooner
Is the Danish King as hated
Well I mean, scratching the mass executions of POWs and his killing of the Basques, I'd say he was a pretty nice guy
Yeah I removed Genocide from my post
It was just plain old killing of nationalists and suppressing the use of their language
Dutch be like: ace the g or loose your knee
Can confirm
Boyfriend is Hungarian, has been speaking it his whole life, went to a Hungarian school in Canada and still has an accent
I have no hope for myself
As a Canadian, and business owner I think we need to readopt the 60 hour work week only through more effort do we gain anything
As a Canadian I would like to thank Denmark for always leaving schnapps when they visit our Hans Island
Like most chocolates, they used to be even better before the multinational corporations fucked with them to save money
Thanks for sending us beautiful tulips every year
The Canadian Tulip Festival is a wonderful tradition
Completely non-biased reporting, just what I expect from the Danes
I also have to say thanks for having great pastries, and a great public transport system
Made it really easy to get my family (my wife and 2 children) around when I was there on vacation 2 years go
Canada isn't really known for its food products outside of Canada which is shame as we have decent food quality and some interesting local foods
I think the problem is being so near the USA we don't really send things out to the rest of the world besides minerals and oil
If you ever come to Canada I recommend skipping Toronto and heading out west to the Mountains as it is great scenery change compared to Denmark
Warning not so good public transport, so a car rental is a must
I’m from Canada and I have experience speaking with & understanding metropolitan French and Swiss French
I’ve never met someone (IRL) from Belgium or Luxembourg so I don’t know the differences are there
I live in Quebec (although I’m Franco-ontarien, it is very similar), and I can pretty much understand everything in France French, Belgium, and Swiss
There might be some phrases I haven’t heard but all in all it is easy to understand
I’d say though, for Quebec, there are some joual things that I sometimes can’t understand if the accent is thick enough from Northern Québec but I rarely run into that
Canadian here, US news is 50% of our news
10% is world news and the rest is Canada specific
Not that anyone asked the Canadians ;)
At home (HK) its China, In Canada, it can be said the USA is a rival
Canada is almost constantly compared to the US in almost every regard, but I’ve often heard Canada being described as “European America”. Also the entirety of Northern Europe is our rival during international winter sports events, but it’s pretty light hearted as long as we don’t lose to Russia
Btw Vegas isn’t by a beach
It’s in the middle of the desert about an 8 hour drive inland from la
Yeah I don’t know why but the cathedral is ALWAYS undergoing renovation when I visit
Seriously
I’ve been there twice and it’s always the same
Budapest surprisingly has some very nice old buildings like their architecture
Italian Cities like Florence are also beautiful architecture wise
Meanwhile so many “Modern” Cities I couldn’t care for
Soulless sky scrapers and weird “Modern Architecture” which looks no better than Communist Concrete Cubes, litter the landscape and create a weird feeling, devoid of Culture
England isn’t much better hun
But of course, let’s just focus on the negatives
Ahh ok i got confused by your wording
Morocco is also an incredible destination
The food alone is worth the trip in my opinion
I hope you realize that it’s not as hot as you make it seem
I’m from Canada and I used to live there
40 degrees may sound like a lot, but after a week, you’ll be acclimated and it’ll feel normal
And yeah, I used to go to Jumeirah (the beach) on foot
It’s not that bad
Also, there’s AC **everywhere**. Literally
Is the vegetable you refer to [rapeseed
There's a town in Saskatchewan that produces a lot of rapeseed (Canola) and honey, and for 60 years used the slogan ["Land of Rape and Honey"]
They finally caved to pressure a few years ago and dropped it, but not before it inspired the name of [this 1988 album by Ministry
I like it here in Canada, although I do wish to move to Europe
I find the politics here too much for me, and if I ever get a good job, ill be sire to move away
If I'm not mistaken, Portugal is one of the safest countries on Earth
Great job guys
I appreciate the David Mitchell reference
My parents left Romania for Canada
They really wanted that "American dream" and felt that they couldn't get that in Romania
To some extent they got it with children, a dog, vacationing, etc
I guess they just really loved North American culture and media
As well, the organization of the country
They have much more faith that police, doctors, and other social services will take care of and be there for them when they need it
However, there is a chance that they may move back to Romania after retiring as their Canadian pensions will serve them very well overseas :)
There's a video on YouTube I think from the TV show Fifth Gear where they attempt to take a Niva across Britain entirely on off road tracks
They didn't have footage for some of it because the lightweight Niva could go where the Defender camera car couldn't.
>  Then I took my shoes off (which **none of them did**)
Savage barbarians
I used to think this was a tv show trope but its crazy that some people actually do this
As a neighbour to the US of A, I feel you
Some American's think Canadians live in Igloos, or have polar bears in their backyard
I don't think they learn much about what's outside the US
Kind seems like a bubble
I grew up in Canada
I remember being totally unphased when grandma emerged from the wolf's belly
You're so right that the only time it struck me is now, as a parent to young kids
I'm a canadian who speaks french, and i find it fairly easy to read Portuguese, italian, and spanish
I do agree with you
I visited Barcelona last year and I read signs in Catalan and understood about 70% of it
Unless it's my Canadian flag
That was the year we came 6th at the World Juniors

I'm still not over it
It's not used in China anymore
They still have some traditional measurement words, but they use metres to describe house size
>the US doesn’t actually use the Imperial system
This is really interesting to me
I am Canadian, here we refer to picked cucumbers as simply "pickles". I just assumed that that was a worldwide thing but it appears not
No I think you're right, it's just a quirk of Canada and the US according to wikipedia
We need a Pret a Manger in Canada
Not fast food really but super handy
Edit: But not with the shitty US menu
The England menu is perfect
I love Max Burger
When I was in Sweden last my wife and kids loved it
The halloumi burger is wonderful
I love all the dips for the fries though
I’ve thought this is likely for a few years
Overcrowded cities are losing their economic advantages and there is less and less motivation to live in cramped conditions when there is space in the countryside
I could be typing this post from anywhere, the heart of Tokyo or Toronto or Tromsø. The internet means I can shop from anywhere and I can sell my own products or services from anywhere
People used to have to move to the cities for any choice in any of those things, and every smaller, spacious town in the countryside has become much more competitive in the last 15 years
The exodus of people fleeing downtown office towers to work from home because of covid and physical distancing just proves how easily it can change
Pretty sure it’s a reference to a steel dome
If Ataturk or someone like him were still leading
I always love that scene for "THE GREEKS INVENTED GAYNESS"
And if we’re to answer strictly from Québec’s point of view, it’s, without any doubt, France
Quebec most famous musicians always try to go to France to hit a bigger market, some famous TV shows are shared and adapted both ways and until recently, it was even cheaper for a Français to attend a Québec university than it was for someone from Ontario
EDIT: After re-reading your point about the “mother/father-son” relationship, Québec-France relationship might be somewhere in between
Even in informal discussions, both countries refer to the other one as “nos cousins”.
But really, what is poverty in Luxembourg compared to other countries
I imagine not as bad as others if the below the poverty line is 3
3k euros (I believe maybe around 4
5k in Canada (!)), You could live damn well off that salary, but I understand prices are astronomically higher
Thanks for the insight
I never realized s country like Luxembourg has these issues with poverty
That's insane that a 7k salary is necessary for a decent life which would equate to maybe 9-10k in Canada where you would live very comfortably
Hard to imagine
Never knew Knut but I love him
I hope heaven is real and he is in it
Wow, those dogs are adorable
I’d like to thank France and Britain for giving me my country
I’d also like to thank the Netherlands and Ireland for giving me my grandparents
As a Canadian who has had a craving for the stroopwafel I had in Haarlem years ago I will use this advice with the packaged stuff I find here
Thank you
From my experience travelling in Europe and seeing the comments here, it seems to be the standard in many european countries
It's not the case in Canada (at least my part of the country), I've always had to "manually" lock the door from the inside or the outside, but I do it by pure muscle memory and I don't even think about it
But that's another biscuit
In archaeology, Leiden is considered pretty highly prestigious
The faculty is in the top 10 worldwide (QS subject ranking), it's also one of the oldest archaeology faculties
Not saying that they lack anything of course, but I have no interest in visiting England, the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, Sweden or Norway
Like it's mostly that I don't see what I can get there that I can't get closer or cheaper other places in Europe or North America
unless a southern grannie is saying it, then maybe it's not sarcastic
Haha
My husband is from there
I love listening to the stories and visiting there

From Brahms I'd recommend his Violin Concerto, any of his symphonies (though #3 is my favourite) and his Double Concerto
He wrote a lot of fun shorter pieces as well, Variations on a Theme of Haydn is one of my favourites of those
Thank you for the price descriptions of food

Not European but still a native English speaker
I don’t think it’s weird or negative in any way, but one thing that’s always oddly bothered me is how native English speakers never celebrate English as a language
You always hear other Europeans (and especially here in Canada, the Quebecers) celebrating their language, but you never hear us celebrating English
Sure, our language may be slightly less cool since so many people around the world speak it which takes away from it being unique, but the fact it’s so universal is a reason to celebrate it
We can pretty much go to any country, and not have to worry about language barriers, which I really appreciate
It makes me conflicted
On one hand, I’m so grateful
It feels like the world adjusts to English speakers, as evidenced by so many programs being translated into English or English being a language in use during an important event
Also, sue me but the best media (songs, tv, movies, books, Reddit) are all in English
On the other hand I’m jealous
English seems like such an easy language to learn because of sheer exposure one from any country can have to it
My cousin from Romania is taught English in school and perfected it from watching Minecraft videos on YouTube and gaming with other 12 yr old boys from around the world
I’m trying to learn Romanian and it is so difficult
I would rather learn a difficult language first, then learn English later in life because it is so easy to attain fluency in
Have you found any yet who do speak Norwegian
Dark is very good
We’ve re-watched the first two seasons for the entertainment value and the continual discoveries of “Ohhhhhh
I’m sure THAT’S the one in Episode 7
Go back
” The more you watch the more you piece together, and simple moments feel like “easter eggs” once you know they’re there
Season 3 feels like wading through a swamp
It feels like by then you need a chart to keep up or to confirm for yourself that the narrative is still somehow coherent
Also the first two seasons are mostly about abstract mystery and wonder, but in 3 they start trotting out religious allusion in detail and mysticism instead of mystery, and that’s disappointing
I wanted to shout at the tv: “But you were telling an original story
Now this old crap again
Why
That said, wade through the swamp
The ending is fine, and it seems like as the ship goes adrift, it blows back on course eventually, well enough
*Obligatory non-European warning, but I really wanted to share-
If ever you come to Canada (specifically Québec), you’ve got to try non-alcoholic bubbly spruce beer

The whole "people came to get grampa one night and we never saw him again" must be a weird thing to brag about

I’ve loved milk since I was a little guy
I see it as a good drink to have with meals as it serves me as a pallet cleanser, or with any chocolate or peanut-butter related snack
Not so much Europe, but my family is from Nicaragua, and they say "en el culo del diablo", which means in the devil's ass
I guess Dutch is convincing Norwegians of his Tahiti plan too
Really, snails as food is a global phenomenon
Not necessarily land snails, but if any country has a coastline (and it's not religiously prohibited) chances are there will be a dish with some kind of water snail (ex
abalone/ormers, limpets, periwinkles, turban shells, conch, whelks, etc
Thats not unique to you guys
Us Canadians use a mix too
* When buying weed, if its a little, you use grams, if its a lot you use ounces
* Construction materials are in imperial
* Long distances use KMs
* Height and weight are in imperial
* Pool and cooking temperatures are imperial but the weather is metric
* We cook using imperial but for everything else we use metric for volume
Theres tons more, i just don't feel like writing them
Scottish are even more “British” than the English as their ancestors and culture has been on Britain for far longer than the Anglo Saxon culture
Did they happen to be speaking to Europeans or non-north Americans
If they were, they were probably just confirming to the way that the other people were measuring
Yeah that’s probably why
“Runners” is probably the most common word for that sort of shoe in Canadian English as well
“Wanker” is too useful a word for me to ignore and it’s now passed into Canadian speech
“Bell-end” however, even though there are times when that’s probably the right word, would sound stupid and fake coming from me
That was a final Jeopardy a year ago right after James Holzhauer’s run

Well since I'm Canadian I'll put a spin on the question, English is number one with french in second place, Punjabi is the third most common with about 430,000 native speakers
Caps lock is only for yelling at people in online matches
Now that you mention it, it's weird to have all members of these European countries speaking English
Weird in an interesting way, not a bad one
Using "of" like in "would of", instead of "would have", is a pet peeve but wtvr
Yup, you are quite correct, but that is the only thing I can really observe that is out of place when this sub speaks English
Other than that, it seems quite fine
Real forests are nice
Well, next time Germany goes crazy give Turkey a call to liberate you
Not a British thing I would say, it's very common in Canada as well
Maybe that's partially due to our shared heritage though

Lmao, I like that one
I like this one haha
Man he said he wants some lies
True, true
Easy just build a big train and then your governments can travel between all your cities

Kinda related: would you guys know Canadian provinces
Like if I mentioned one of the bigger ones like Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia or Alberta, would you guys know
Or what about the bigger cities
I’ve also heard people complain the opposite way too
Like if you assume that everyone around the world knows your small state, it makes you sound arrogant and makes it sound like you’re the center of the universe

As a Canadian, I'm super jealous of everyone's relative proximity to each other in the EU
Land travel sucks here
(Actually, air travel does too—prices are insane
I live in Winnipeg—a city of around 750,000 people
To get to anywhere else that's interesting you can either drive ~25 hours to the East (Toronto) or six hours or so to the West (Regina, which barely counts as interesting)
Fourteen or so hours West gets you to Edmonton or Calgary, which both have around a million people
About 20 hours West gets you to Vancouver
Ah, or you can drive eight hours North to see polar bears on Hudson's Bay
The idea of passing through several countries in just a few hours is bananas to me
Is there no push to adopt Gaelic in commerce
Just forcing signage to be bilingual will go a long way towards making people feel comfortable in the language no

I knew the housing market in Ireland was bad, but I didn't know it was that bad
Is Latvian a slavic language
This is the best advice
So many people get hung up on grammar and pronunciation that they forget to learn vocabulary
You can make grammatical mistakes and still be understood
If you don’t have the vocabulary, you can’t communicate a point across
Plus it’s easier to remember cases with examples than memorizing the conjugation
As someone learning Slovene: in my experience I spoke better when I didn’t care about grammatical rules and just focused on communication
The grammar will come more naturally if you learn through examples
And it’s less discouraging
july 1st tends to have a lot of fireworks here too
So how exactly does the EU's freedom of movement and of residence work
Sorry in advance if this is such a basic question
I'm a curious Canadian who wants to know how the freedom of movement and residence works for an EU citzen, especially for those individuals who are utilizing it to live and work in another country
I can read all the facts about it from governement websites, but I want to know about the personal experiences you can't get from a government webpage
I just discovered through a cousin who did it, that I can obtain EU citizenship through ancestry and now I'm seriously considering adjusting my current plan to pursue a longtime dream of mine to live and work in Europe
EDIT: Thanks for all the responses
Looks like I'm incredibly lucky to have the ability to obtain an EU passport
I have lots of research to do but I'm really not fan of the (lack of) worklife balance among other things here in Canada and I'm thinking the Netherlands fits a lot of my life goals
If any saint here knows how the civil engineering job market is there please let me know
My niche is geotechnical with regard to dams, so its a dream for me to work on the Dutch coastal engineering projects
In France there is 3 major movements :
-Scouts of France (SF)
-"Unitary" scouts of France (USF)
-European scouts (ES)
I have spent 8 years with the ES and am enjoying my last year
Here are some characteristics of the different movements :
SF :
-No hierarchy ; Separated in age groups ; Their uniform is composed of shorts, a "group scarf" and a colourful shirt (it can be red, blue, green etc
-They do more caritative work than the other movements, but have less real "scouting" time and shorter camps
Thus, the 2 other movements consider them like wimps
- They are also "mixed". In a same group you'll have boys and girls doing their shit together
ES :
-A "troupe" is composed of "patrols" (between 3 and 6), and each patrol has 6 to 9 scouts
Among those patrols, their is a hierarchy based on age
-The uniform is a brown shirt, a group scarf, blue shirts with a leather belt, mountain shoes or rangers, and a blue Beret
- Boys and girls are separated in different "troupes", but sometimes they meet to do some stuff together
USF :
-They are a mix between the SF and ES
They are very similar to the ES, with the European thing left aside
-The uniform is also very similar
One of the main difference is the color of the sweater
For the ES, it is a dark navy blue, and for the USF it's light brown
These are the main characteristics of each movement
It isn't complete, so if any of you have questions concerning the activities, regulations or politics among those groups, feel free to ask me anything
I remember Medvescak played a hockey game in the Pula Arena, that was so cool
That’s very cool
I want to experience that someday
Chernobyl, definitely Chernobyl
French is my second language and many Canadian cities have obligatory cringeworthy mottos
Winnipeg is “Gateway to the West”. Calgary is “Heart of the New West”. Edmonton is “City of Champions”.
Or, as I called it one day when describing the city was assigned to me in French class, *Ville des champignons*. City of Mushrooms
I wanted *Ville des Champions*.
If my parents were to get me a romanian passport would I still be eligible for those cheap "600-800€" prices

What a small world we live in
Happy cake day
Is a fags pole like the cigarettes version of those things [people keep posting on Pinterest to give away their old books] Ha
In Canada we don’t have fLag poles on people’s homes either
It looks natural for us to see our flag on a public building or a town square or something
Maybe because a flag is supposed to unite a community, it belongs somewhere where people assemble more than behind someone’s hedge
In my neighbourhood I could probably walk 2 km in any direction and only see maybe one
Depressing af
It's a story of a group of heroine addicts who were never really able to get clean
I kinda forget, were they clean by the end of the movie
Not to mention the scene where the baby was found dead
I dunno, the UK is so grim and rustic and gray, it's just depressing in general
Well I didn't say it was bad, just depressing and sad
Definitely left a mark on me though
I still enjoyed it, I guess just not my type of movie
Hard to watch, addicts throwing their lives away like that
Ah yes
I remember now
No, is it any good
In Québec there are additional curse words that don’t exist (in the same way) as France
Those curse words are all related to the Roman Catholic Church, and there are even grammatical rules here as to how to use them and how to use different combinations of them
And each combination corresponds to how angry that person is using them
I found this example on Wikipedia (I’m not Quebecois enough to master les sacres lol)
« **Mon tabarnak j'vais te décâlisser la yeule, câlice or mon tabarnak, m'a tu t'l'a décâlisser ta gran' yeule**: Décâlisser means "to fuck something up"; yeule comes from the derived noun gueule, which refers to an animal's throat or maw, but is used in joual to mean the human mouth or face
The whole sentence can be summarized as "I'm gonna beat your fucking face in, you motherfucker". »
There’s a sentence that puts the in a specific order, and if you mix up the order than people will judge lol
I can never remember the right order, so I won’t butcher *les sacres* here lol
You could add a gender-specifier if you wanted, e.g. girl/boy friend (kız/erkek arkadaş), sister/brother (kız/erkek kardeş)
Some more trivia: Turkish also doesn't differentiate gender on professions, e.g. aktor is actor/actress, garson (from the French word) is waiter/waitress etc
On the flip side, there are specific words for some relatives like older sister (abla), older brother (abi), and your paternal vs maternal aunts/uncles/grandparents
Fish is a Germanic word (coming from Proto-Germanic *fiskaz*)
However, if you're a person such that the only animals in your diet will be fish, you're not a fishatarian, you're a pescatarian (from the Italian word for fish, *pesce*, which in turns comes from Latin *piscis*)
However, digging deep into history, both *fish* and *pesce* ultimately come from the same Proto-Indo-European word, anyway (*peysk*)
I feel like I'm a spiritual Swede haha I've always answered questions this way and was confused as a kid as to why people thought I was "brief" and "not talkative"
I tried to find language selection there but could not
And I don't speak Norweigan
They work surprisingly well, I have one and it really help with the winter gloom
That's what we say in Québec
Week-end feels a bit cringy to me
Where are you from
Week-end is common slang that everyone uses from time to time
Québec City
I do hear people using week-end instead of fin de semaine from time to time, but not that much

I speak French and Spanish, both to an upper-intermediate to advanced level
I've studied a bit of Portuguese
Italian: 65%
Portuguese: 90%
Romanian: 50%

Galician: 75%
I'm not even European, and I feel like a part of our culture has been lost
Notre Dame belongs to all of Western Civilization
The world, really
Only because they don't know Quebecois swear words :)
I swear 90% of the time in french
On the second one you mentioned, I remember hearing in a video that the government put in place after angry moustache man went to away, but before the end of the war, they began planning for rebuilding the country's infrastructure, cities, and armed forces
As if they were going to remain in power with their current/former political system
The Netherlands actually has a higher English proficiency than Canada
Fun fact
It happens in Canada too, it's only really when they have something for you though
I did not know this was a North American thing
They have an amazing interactive set online
I was on it for hours reading about the uprising, listening & reading interviews
Absolutely amazing place I plan on visiting
Canada legalized in Oct 2018
Our cities do not smell on every corner like it does in Amsterdam (I’ve visited) although you will get occasional whiffs
We are not able to smoke yet in public places and do not have smoke coffee shops like Amsterdam does though so that could be a difference
Although, I think if I have to endure smelling a cigarette every time I leave a building cannabis smokers should be able to smoke wherever tobacco smokers can
The city I live in (Edmonton) allowed public consumption when it was legalized here
I've only really gotten a whiff or two when walking in most areas
Only in the nightlife areas of the city can you noticeably smell it
And I’m of the complete opposite opinion
Tobacco smoke makes me nauseous, and while pregnant it made me throw up whenever I smelt it
I learned my family was going to Florida on a vacation when I was 6
I looked on the globe we had, trying to find where we were, and where Florida was, but I couldn’t read well
I knew that we lived near a body of water (Lake Ontario), but didn’t know which one
I then made the assumption that we lived in Florida, and that Florida was Argentina
I had a similar experience but with sports
Like some races where only allowed to play certain sports
I think it formed from seeing basketball, football, and hockey
The idea died after I asked friends at school about it
Those cities are not in Canada
Yet
This reminds me of a Hoi4 mod that places Poland in the Atlantic Ocean
I thought something similar
That there was, in the last 100 years: WW1, WW2, WW3, and Afghanistan
The only reason I thought Afghanistan was such a big deal is because we didn’t have a war in a long time
Au Québec, on dit "les milléniaux"!
Doesn't seem particularly worse than Westminster systems tbh
I get that the point of the thread was how the systems exist \*as written\* - and British MPs can no-confidence their PM while French MPs can't with the President - but \*in reality\* when the PM has a solid majority in parliament s/he can pretty much do anything
Like yes, but also the Fourth Republic [was truly catastrophic] (like Italy's First Republic, but many times less stable) and pendulum naturally swung away
I agree that it's time to swing it back a bit though
Obviously not European, but I know people from Toronto who went to Montreal
I didn’t even know staying within Canada was an option
Québécois here, we have the Office de la langue française, (OQLF) which is an actual authority on the Français here in Québec
The *Académie*, like *Le Robert*, *Le Larousse* are seens as tools to help us determine the proper usage of the language
I would say that it is engraved in the Quebecois DNA to protect their language against anglicisms due to us being surrounded by so much english
The OQLF has even been blamed for its overzealous attitude on enforcing the rules set by the *Charte de la langue française* (see Pastagate)
Agreed to everything that’s been said in your comment, OQLF is a great institution and an absolute requirement to allow Quebec to thrive as a « Société distincte ».
Pastagate was the result of an unfortunate mistake of one public servant which has been quick corrected
I refered to it to highlight the kind of authority that OQLF has, (which, I consider, is a good thing)
I think it’s a pretty unique and awesome institution for us Québécois who majorly care about the survival of French within our territory
I did too
Thought you guys spoke “Belgish” or just “Flemish” until a few years ago
Lol calling people ignorant while calling the Anglo-sphere "anglo-saxon"
This is a new level of absurdity
> All of even most Belgians are keen on ripping the country apart
this isn't true
was kidding
All I know is that yall don't have a government half the time because Wallonie and Vlaanderen are at each others' throats it seems :/
hahaha, yes, I am the FLQ and I will bomb innocent civilians until Québec gets their independence

So someone in Kalingrad would speak the same dialect as someone in  Vladivostok
True, makes sense lol
When does the dialect become another language
Is Catalan a different language than Spanish or just a dialect
Similarly would Sicilian be different than Tuscan Italian

What’s the most foreign license plates you’ve ever seen in Europe
For me, once I was in Mostar, Bosnia and a bright pink ~2009 Chrysler 300 drove past with plates from Washington state

I watched a video about the history of Luxembourg (I know it’s not micro, but it is small), and it was really fascinating
yes, but the real question is would they try again
So I have Serbian and French editions of HP (in addition to the original English) and I find it amusing to compare the three
But here's an interest excerpt from *Translating Children's Literature* by Gillian Lathey that discusses their differences (for my fellow nerds):
&#x200B;
>Translations of the Harry Potter books indicate, however, that the trend towards the acceptance of spoken language varieties in children's book is by no means universal
Throughout the series, Hagrid speaks a non-standard English that is not characteristic of any particular locality \[but that is probably\] meant to indicate that Hagrid has working-class origins and certainly that he is of lower social status than the highly educated Dumbledore
>An international gathering of Harry Potter translators \[...\] revealed a range of responses to the representation of Hagrid's vernacular
Serbian translator Vesna Stamenkovic Roganovic \[...\] was quite prepared to use a regional dialect but rejected a solution that would make Hagrid seem to be 'a Serbian peasant rather than an English giant'. So the translators created an innovative '*Hagrid pidgin'.*
>\[...\] On examining a number of other translations it appears that a lingering reluctance to reproduce a colloquial language results; for example, in the French translation, Hagrid uses standard grammar and pronounciation
\[...\] Anne-Lise Feral attributes the French translator's strategy here \[...\] to 'the importance of grammar in the school curriculum in France where pupils spend a minimum of eight years learning the complex mechanisms of their own language'. (Lathey 79-80)
Thats a silly argument
France was already gearing up so they were committed by that point
Yes Germany brought UK into the war, but we can just as easily say "Belgium turned into a world war because had Belgium given Germans permission to ride through, UK wouldnt have gotten involved".
Which is a way stronger argument than saying the war started because Germany attacked Belgium

I love the Finnish accent, when my two Finnish friends speak to each other in Finnish it sounds like birds chirping ️
Also one of them said she barely passed English classes in high school and she speaks and writes fluently, so you’re doing something right (wrong

Heh when I visited the Netherlands I was shocked at both the level of English spoken by EVERYONE, and at how awful the accent sounded
Of course I learned to say “spreekt u engels

How is this pronounced
Because Vienna is cool sounding
In italian the "gn" sound is simply pronounced under specific grammatical circumstances (of which elude me), kind of how in french a "h" followed by an "o" is silent but nothing to denote that
C$1 - an apple or a small bag of chips/crisps
C$10 - a small bottle of maple syrup
C$100 - an adult transit pass in a mostly inadequate system, or filling the car with gas about twice, thus making transit look even less favourable by comparison

Even with the discounted prices of the collapsing airline sector, it would be C$ 588 (£340 / €390) at the cheap end to fly across the country
Commuter trains only exist in one corner of Canada from Toronto to Quebec City really, and though it would be a dream to take the train across the country that is mostly a premium tourist service that would cost easily 3 or 4 times that
It is one of the most vivid flavours from my childhood, like vanilla or cinnamon or chocolate
Essential for pancakes or waffles, maybe just 50mL or so, drizzled on top
I also like it in savoury foods, with garlic, pepper, ginger, lemon, and soy sauce, to glaze a filet of salmon
It’s one of my favourite flavours and I would regret not having it at least once a month
Usually it is only horrifying when made into something your grandmother might prepare for a church tea, called “maple fudge
”  It is basically a small brick of diabetes, so sweet that I can barely tolerate even one just to be polite
And also fake “maple-flavoured” syrup is available, usually at bargain breakfast restaurants where it is enjoyed by people who are happy to unleash a tidal wave of any sticky syrupy sweet thing on their plate full of carbs
Of course there is no comparison
Seconded that that is truly horrific dubbing

In Québec, we Say "le saint empire romain germanique" so yeah, in french we use "German"
Not Europe, but Québec has the « Office québécois de la langue française » which is a political office that attempts to regulate and promote the usage of the French language in the borders of Québec
Isn’t this two separate issues though
Yes I understand centralised prescriptive language authorities vs decentralised descriptivist anything-goes
But that’s separate from the question of whether people decide they prefer to speak their own language or not
Like Québec has the *Office québécois de la langue française* and people joke about the “Language Police” when some restaurant gets fined for having their menu only in English or Cantonese or something
But it’s not all-powerful, and the reason French Canadians don’t say “le week-end” or “un e-mail” is because they prefer *fin de semaine* and *courriel*.  They don’t feel like it’s silly or a put-on, it’s that they know the language can handle some new concept so why wouldn’t it grow to do so
Not a word, but J and G confused the HELL out of me
In French, J is “zhee” while G is “zhé”. In English, J is “jay” and G is “jee”. I’m pretty sure that’s the one last thing i’m lacking before I can say I’m fully fluent in English
This is confusing in English too when you grow up and hear about the concept for the first time
Have to see it in writing to believe it
I’m an anglophone and now that you point out tomb, womb, and bomb, I can’t un-see it

Makes sense since “CANZUK nations” as they’re commonly called all share the most in common, as predominantly white, Christian, English speaking countries
Africa and the Caribbean just aren’t what I think of when I hear “Commonwealth”
Very accurate
While most Canadians hate to admit it, we are very American
English Canada used to be very culturally British until around the 60s when our entire country was rebranded, but that’s a whole other thing
Lots of people (including me) believe we should be closer to our British (and French) roots

You want war, suffering and poverty
Changed the flag from [this] to the current maple leaf flag, national anthem changed from The Maple Leaf Forever which very very strongly celebrated Canada’s British heritage (google the lyrics if you’d like) to O Canada which I personally find a bit mundane, national day’s name changed from Dominion Day to Canada Day
Much more, but these are the three main things
It was all in an effort to create a more uniquely “Canadian” identity instead of a British one, but now if you ask Canadians what our culture is, they’ll just say some bullshit like multiculturalism
The monarchy for example hardly has any presence in our country anymore, yet it used to be widely celebrated
Shame in my opinion

Canadian here, as a Canadian I can speak French and can say that (atleast in my family) we do actually say "Comme si, comme sa" often as a way to say "So so". The direct translation is "Like this, Like that"
Canada here, anywhere more than 100 miles (160km) from the US border is the “middle of nowhere” to most of us
90% of Canada’s population lives within the southern most area of Canada and within 100 miles (160km) of the US border

Here in Québec, it depends on the language
If you’re an anglophone speaking French with an accent than it’s likely you’ll receive ridicule
If you’re a francophone speaking English with an accent than people don’t even bat an eye at it
According to some of my allophone friends, if you speak French with an accent than you’ll usually get the same reaction to anglophones; but if you speak English with that accent, Anglos are more likely to be kind
Edit: I’ll add that Canadian anglophones are more likely to receive a negative attitude whilst speaking French with an accent than American anglophones
From what I know people from Herzegovina stretch their vowels a bit more, especially people from Mostar
I also feel like there exists a "seljak" accent

Lol, as a Canadian, I’m also a little resentful of the way Word Processors and apps all tell me my spelling is wrong because it’s not spelled the American way
Lol, absolutely; I always correct the “auto-correct”
Because Canadian English is actually somewhere in between the two
We have more spelling that is the same as British than we do American, but some words (usually involving the choice between 1 or 2 L’s or between an S or a Z) may be more similar to American spelling
I did a google search and found an example chart:
Well if it helps, I find the female German accent incredibly sexy /shrug
We aren't your protectorate thank you very much
I am grateful for the support and alliance the US has with us but that's a kind of offensive term to me frankly

I don't think he did either but it's still kind of offensive regardless
That is a much better way to phrase it, thanks
Truly disgusting, I'm sorry to hear that
What about French
What do you think of forced Irish implementation similar to laws like we have in Quebec for French
In Quebec all signage must be in french, immigrants must attend french school, government workers need to know french, all services must be able to offer french ect
You can have other languages too but it must always be in addition to french
As others mentioned, Quebecois is like the difference between the French in Paris and in the south of france or with the French in Belgium or Switzerland
Maybe a tiny bit larger but yeah no where near a different language
Similar to how Aussie English differs than Canadian English for example
> revive Slovak
I don't think that counts the same way Irish does though as Slovak is extremely similar to other south Slavic languages, yes
I don't speak any but I imagine it as the difference between British English vs American English
Compared to that, Irish is more of it's own thing
> There are quite significant difference between Czech and Slovak (its closest neighbour language)
Interesting
I did not know, thank you

In 1917 a Norwegian cargo ship and a French ship (which carried a shit ton of explosives) collided with each other in Halifax harbour (Atlantic coast of Canada area) the French ship exploded and killed 2000 people, injured 9000 and was the largest explosion in history up until the nuclear bombs dropped in WW2
Everything within a half mile was completely obliterated, the explosion also caused a tsunami, 31 000 people were left homeless
The Norwegian ship ended up being on the wrong side of the harbour, but it was ruled that the French ship should’ve been more careful with its cargo and the French ship could’ve avoided the collision
Not surprisingly there was a really strong anti-french sentiment in Atlantic Canada after the incident, in the end, it was deemed that they were both at fault

When I was a kid, the morning and afternoon care program for working parents was run by three thick Welsh speakers that just moved to Canada to setup shop
When we all entered the first grade they had to have 30 or so kids get speech therapy to remove the thick welsh accent we picked up
What made it even funnier is that we had tons of inner-city straight from Vietnam kids speaking broken English with heavy Welsh accents for the first year in Edmonton which is about as far from both places as you could get
I am almost 40 now and I still remember how awesome and kind those 3 care workers were

It's frightening to read through the comments
Germans really don't see any issue with having 40 000 foreign soldiers on their soil
Et plus généralement un obstacle majeur pour une Europe indépendante géo-politiquement (à moins que ce soit un voeu pieux)
it's probably more frightening to have a token army try to hold off the Russians, to them
Who knows
People would be trading Russian foreign soldiers for American ones, were it not for the USA hauling ass for the last seventy years
Oh I can understand given your unique history
I'm more familiar with the French point of view, being a French-speaker, and it's crazy how on the two nations are different on this topic
And to correct a statement made in the comments, there is no US military presence in France
De Gaulle kicked them out at the time
Don't you think it also continuously shapes your relationship with the US
I mean the French, the German and the Brits could easily due the job against Russia
I don't think the EU needs protection from the US militarily speaking
Absolument
Mais à voir comment les Allemands ne font pas de cas des 40 000 GI sur leur territoire, j'ai bien peur que vous soyez bien mal barrés...
Perhaps, but there really needs to be a strong speedbump against the Russians which simply doesn't exist in many countries, Germany included
More so with Trump in power
I'm curious, is there an active movement to kick the US military out or most people just don't care enough for it
You're right, it probably has to do with East Germany/Eastern Europe and the fear of a comeback of the Russians
You never have enough military power when you're frightened
Seems quite different in Western Europe
As early as in 1966, De Gaulle said "*Qui croit encore à la menace d'une invasion soviétique* ?" But France does have the nuclear weapon
Un grand merci pour la mise en contexte très intéressante
La géopolitique européenne n'est pas simple compte tenu de l'histoire récente extrêmement différente pour chaque pays d'Europe et en particulier l'Allemagne et les pays de l'Est lorsqu'on parle de Russie
Par curiosité, c'est Sarkozy qui proposait une négociation avec la Russie en 2017
(et juste pour être sûr, je dis tout ça en étant bien conscient que le Canada est encore beaucoup plus mal barré que l'Europe, géographie et relation de pouvoir déséquilibrée oblige)
I see
And you think most Germans know that other European countries (like France for instance) showed them the door at some point
Canada checking in, we have two big polish grocery chains here that compete
Yes there are lots in my city, and the surrounding area
I live in a Ukrainian neighbourhood so there's a combination of Eastern European food available, and Polish food products are available literally everywhere in my neighbourhood
We have large Eastern European import superstores, but we also have small delis, fruit markets, and sections in the "regular" stores that sell Polish food
(I didn't grow up speaking Polish, but I am half Polish myself)
In Toronto/Greater Toronto Area, we have a Polish/Eastern European grocery store
(I think it's Polish but they sell stuff from all over Eastern Europe, with an emphasis on Polish products) You can get everything from paczki, to Polish spices, drinks etc
I like paczki, as my family is Slovene, and it's like a sweeter version of our donuts (krofi)
Of course, I like all the fruit juice you can get, it's fresher and not as artificial as the juice found in Canada
And there's these fudge chocolates that my SO loves, krowki
But I'm not a huge fan of fudge so I have a bias
There's also a hot food table that sells a really good potato salad, I'm guessing it's Polish style, looks like it from a google search
And of course, Tyskie
There is usually some stuff in the foreign foods aisle
Nah
in Toronto, the country's largest and most multicultural city, there are a few Polish delicatessens, but no Polish grocers that I'm aware of
Most non-ethnic delis and butchers will have a few varieties of kielbasa, but apart from that, really the only Polish food you'll find are pierogies in grocery stores (though of course Montreal-style bagels are loved across the country
TIL that bagels originated in Poland
) Our value brand, No Name, sells a 1kg bag of pierogies for $5, pretty unbeatable calorie:dollar ratio for when you're broke
In Canada, there is a Polish deli I sometimes go to to get this little balls of pork
They’re covered in some breading(?) and they’re on skewers
I forget the name of them but they’re always fun to eat
Where I live has a lot of European Areas, theres an Armenian Centre, A Polish Park, a Armenian Church, a Ukrainian Centre, a Greek Centre, a lot of foreign Restaurants, and probably some more that I don’t know about

How old were the students
Hmm, well that's close enough to adulthood that it's a little sad
At least in Canada, if an anglophone is suddenly pretending to be Hungarian in the middle of an English sentence, it can seem pretentious or even disrespectful
Since we’re a bilingual country we see this a lot between English and French
It would sound completely demented for an anglophone to say “This summer I’m taking a holiday to *Paireee*”. Nah, you’re going to Parissss
Don’t start imitating someone else’s accent in the middle of an English sentence
So here it would sound totally natural for:
* a francophone Canadian to say “Montréal” with a French accent,
* ...probably even if they were speaking English
* As an anglophone it would sound totally natural for me to say “Vancouver” with an English accent,
* ...probably even if I’m speaking French
But it would sound like a pompous affectation if I as an anglophone were speaking English and randomly saying the one single word “Montréal” with a sudden surprise French accent
Similarly it can sound very jarring to hear a francophone speaking French and squawk out “Van COO Ver” in English for no reason
It breaks the rhythm of each language
That said, what’s different here is that “Budapesht” could be an English word, it sounds totally normal with regular English sounds
But it seems like when we took this word into the language, we took the spelling instead of the pronunciation, so Budapesssst it is
Arabic, Mandarin, Spanish
I already know english, french, and basic italian
Arabic because its cool and the script is badass (only second to Georgian); Mandarin for obvious reasons, and Spanish so I can speak fluently to my wife's family

Why is it "definitely not Asian"? To be clear Im talking from a geographic approach and not culturally
Turkey is, in my opinion, both European and Asian (geographically but also culturally)
Also, Im curious how you classify the Arabian peninsula or even a country like Syria if they are not Asian
You ain't seen nothing yet
Yeah we kinda just throw "ing" at the end of things and boom now it's a verb
I kind of love how "*noun* + *ing*" works in English, even when the resulting words sound odd
Want to make some nonsense verbs
Well, let's go nonsensing
Not a verb
Well, guess what
It is now
I remember learning a bit of French during school and grammar was by far the hardest part, as for English pronunciation it's just kinda a mess
Sorry if this doesn't make sense but how does not having articles work
Like if I say something like "I was walking down the street and I saw a yellow bus with an antenna on it" would that become "I was walking down street and saw yellow bus with antenna"
(after writing that out that's kinda how we speak when we do eastern European impersonations)
Well, we sort of have three genders, like German (male, female, neuter)
He = masculine
She = feminine
It = neuter
It's just that the neuter class has grown so large and absorbed everything except for the "natural gendered" objects
As for adjectives, they're mostly non-gendered
The one gendered adjective that I can think of off the top of my head is blond / blonde
A blond man / A blonde woman
Though some fail to make this distinction in writing
It's not a truly genderless language, like you would see with Finnish pronouns or Turkish pronouns
Englishing verbs is fun, ain't it
Roma people suffered the worst under the fascist and communist Romanian governments

That’s what I hate so many old songs are now reunited by nazism I love such hits as die watch am rein,the old imperial anthem and so many more
You could follow our lead we have GSTQ as the royal anthem and O Canada as the national anthem
What about *Le temps des cerises*?
Soon all the world will sing O Canada as their capitals burn
To start with, it's a bit weird for English Canadians to have adopted the O Canada
It's an anthem that praises the Canadien (read Québécois) "race" and catholicism
>Sous l'œil de Dieu, près du fleuve géant,Le Canadien grandit en espérant
Il est né d'une race fière,Béni fut son berceau
Le ciel a marqué sa carrièreDans ce monde nouveau
Toujours guidé par sa lumière,Il gardera l'honneur de son drapeau,Il gardera l'honneur de son drapeau
Et voilà. Concis et magnifiquement exprimé.

Apfelschorle is the light of my life
I've tried to make it in Canada so many times with different brands of apple juice and carbonated water and it's always a disappointment
First that comes to mind for me is the Berliner Schloss
Is that even legal, to do that at 13
15 is pretty much a safe balance between not child labour, and still instilling a good work ethic into malleable minds
Also, who do your parents know, to have been able to get that job so seemingly easily (I mean, it was for three days, but that's still perplexing)
I didn’t hear about it in Canada until this post
“Don’t be such a tent-visitor” is a fantastic saying
The other difficulty is that most anglophones probably don’t think of any meaning to the word “nightmare” beyond “bad dream
The “night” part is obvious but most English speakers probably wouldn’t even think of a female horse, they’d just think “that’s what the word is” with no particular connections
And a mare as a mythological character is probably lost from the everyday language except a few linguistic hobbyists
Fascinating to learn though
"To purr" translates to "ronronner", so the french one ends up being a bit cliché, it's *Ron Ron*.

In Canada we have the standard North American plug
But for electric stoves and electric dryers we have a different high voltage plug
Since Europe has higher voltage to start with, do you have a different plug for those high draw appliances
Now that's a serious looking plug lol
Thanks for the answer
Interestingly clothes washers have the normal plug, that's enough to run the motor to turn the barrel
It's the heat needed for the dryer and stove that draws so much
It doesn't have to do with grounding or how secure it is
Its just that the standard plug doesn't give enough electricity for electric stoves or dryers
Does the standard euro plug give enough for those
Ah that looks more in line with what our stove plugs look like
What is the plural of a rice ball then
Yes they are
We always refer to them as arancini because really who ever just eats one
Woah
The ones here are much smaller, maybe 5 cm in diameter
You always get a couple in an order
I want to see these huge arancini
Edit: I think that the ones I’m talking about are Calabrese style
THAT IS THEM
I’ve been calling them the wrong name forever
Everyone here (and there’s a lot of Italians in Toronto) will just call them all arancini - for simplicity perhaps
Regardless it’s incorrect and I love learning new stuff like this
Thank you
More complexity
Here’s my conclusion: the Italian-Canadians have merged the size of a supplì and the ingredients of arancini into some sort of delicious food stuff
I am going to do some research and find out if there are indeed Sicilian arancini/e here and I will report back

Especially within youth
I am in college and already had 3 part time jobs, it just seems really bizarre for me
Note: i also mean full-time employment as well
Because in my country it is not super hard to find a job, especially if you have degree
I literally know maybe 2 people who couldn't find job for more than 8 months after graduation
That really sucks

No, just curiosity

Many of Canada’s provinces are just physical descriptions of a large body of water in the area but translated into the language of whatever native tribe was living there
Quebec: Algonquin word for “narrow passage/strait” which refers to the Fleuve du Saint Laurent
(A super important and massive river in Quebec and Ontario)
Ontario: Variations of the Iroquois word for “sparkling beautiful water” referring to The Great Lakes
Manitoba: Cree for “narrows of the great spirit” referring to how Lake Manitoba is very narrow at its centre but very wide at its ends
Saskatchewan: Cree for “fast moving river” named after the Saskatchewan river
Yukon: unknown native word for, you guessed it, river
All other provinces are just named after something British/European
Except Northwest Territories (pretty explicitly named)

There’s a podcast called “Hardcore History” presented by Dan Carlin which is an excellent podcast on all sorts of historical time periods and events

There are reasons why that is, Americans actually treat our language with respect while a lot of English Speaking Canada makes fun of us

One of my favorite cheap meals is beans, cut up hot dogs and a topping of either shredded cheese or a pie crust with a little dollop of hot pepper jelly in the center
I'm hungover as hell right now and am probably going to go make some
You can definitely get cheese curds in any supermarket; I'm not sure how well they'll integrate, but it's worth a shot, so long as I can keep myself from eating the entire pack before actually cooking with it
I can also confirm that a bit of maple syrup in the beans produces S-Rank Five Star God-Tier beans

Weighing your own produce at the store
When I visited Europe I LOVED the idea that people select their own produce, type in their own code on a scale, receive a scannable barcode and the cashier just scans and moves on

One thing about drive thrus here, is that restaurants often prioritize them over customers inside the restaurant
Restaurants keep track of how long people are waiting in drive thrus, and they're supposed to keep that down as much as possible

Here, fast-food places can be accurately called restaurants
I don't particularly agree with it, but it's commonplace

Yes; I think Canada might be a good example of what you’re describing
Our Northernmost territory, Nunavut predominantly speaks an Inuit language called Inuktitut; Quebec speaks a Quebecois inflected French; New Brunswick and Labrador have large (maybe majority
) regions of Acadian French; the Western and central provinces are predominantly English speaking; and each of these linguistic areas has its own unique culture and foods
We are however tied together by generally similar values, though culturally they do play out differently
And of course we do have our internal strife, but on the whole, I would say most people (perhaps not the most vocal people) are happy with a unified Canada
Provinces and territories elect our own leaders (premiers) but we also elect our federal leader, and what is provincially governed and what is federally governed are divided
That is not to say that premiers and the prime ministers office don’t ever disagree, but that’s why we get to elect new ones every 4 years ;)
Additionally, while the population of Europe is certainly far greater than that of Canada, in terms of land mass, we are almost equal
That means the geographical separation that affects transportation and cultural uniqueness would be similar in both Canada and the EU

In Canada, the most universally loved hero is easily Terry Fox, he was an amputee who lost his leg to cancer, but still ran a marathon every single day across Canada (Halifax to Vancouver, Atlantic coast to Pacific coast) in an attempt to raise money for cancer research
His “Marathon of Hope” originally he raised 24
1 million dollars before he died halfway across Canada, but he still continued to inspire people and over 700 million dollars has been donated to cancer research in his name
Canada here:
Elementary school grades are taught way too structured
Kids need to move around, not sit in desks for 8 hours like university students
Also, kids learn through different learning styles and this is not addressed
History is atrocious through out our education system
We are taught in great (too much) detail about Canadian history and minimally about the rest of world history
We are a very young country and it would benefit students to know what went on in the rest of the world
Language system is terrible
We are a bilingual country and unless you live in Quebec you learn the bare minimum of French right up to graduation
Religion should not be a part of the education system at all, it’s 2019
Separate Catholic schools should not get additional funding that the public system doesn’t have access too
This is what church and Sunday school is for
Additionally in smaller centres, some communities only have access to a separate school so children are forced to learn this shit even if they and the parents don’t agree
Basics on daily life, politics, health, and finances is grazed over or ignored completely
While there is argument this used to be what parents taught children, it’s not happening and new generations are at a loss when they graduate and move out on their own
We called this Red Ass or Red Wall

Everyone knows that Hans Island is Canadian, not Danish
In fact, it’s the heartland of our culture and heritage, the place where we first set out in search of maple syrup, the place where poutine was first imagined, and where we first argued about whether it was Hans Island or Île Hans
It’s like how the Icelandic look to Þingvellir as their ancient seat of government, or the Japanese look to Kyoto, we Canadians look to Hans Island
The Danes know this
Hans Island, Danish
That would be like us pretending Møn Island or Funen is Canadian
“Oh sure it’s just a little east of Newfoundland, but it’s ours, I tell ya

Looks like Parcheesi
Which is interesting supposed to be one of the oldest games ever developed
We brag a lot about our country
Maybe it’s just because Canada is often compared to the US, or the fact that Canada usually ranks pretty high on the “best X in the world” but we will often “subtly” bring it up when talking to foreigners or Americans
Also we are passive aggressive and don’t like confrontation (unless it’s in the hockey rink) which often leads to bottled up emotions
Could be worse -- Serbs are malcontents with a superiority complex
The continued strength of the current government in Russia is a product of the "resource curse", I think in general general moving past the absurd reliance on natural resources would be beneficial to everybody not an Oligarch

Therefore it all defaults to Russian because chances are its Russian due to population disparities

I've never heard of comme même instead of quand même in Canada though

I don't know much about it to be honest
Can't wait to read the thread now
Edit: So I interpreted the question as the mini-political bloc and not the three countries individually lol
Another fun fact: between 1945 and ~1955, Canada had the third largest navy behind the US and UK
Why can't Germany be "Big Austria"?
We prefer Cold America

Dude how can you not mention stroopwafel
I fucking love this thread so much
You're gay and a cat
I’ve heard that leaders of BeNeLux countries can fill in for each other in certain functions
Is that true
Sorry, I have a few more questions
Is there a written agreement for this
And to what extend can the Prime Minister of Belgium or Luxembourg represent you on the international stage (can they speak on your behalf
Negotiate/sign agreements on your behalf ? )
Are there some specific examples of this happening
Why do you trust other countries’ leaders to have your best interest in mind
Why not send a second-in-command from your own country if the prime minister is not available
Is that how Belgium functions without a government for so long
They do not need their own PM because they can just borrow yours when needed ;)
The last question is a joke, but I do want to know how Belgium functions without a government for so long
Thank you for your detailed answer
Spain: Getting fresh fruit from the Arab market in Grenada and then going hiking in the mountains for a day
The fruit tasted like candy
Finding a stream that fed the Alhambra and cooling ourselves off in it
France: Couchsurfing with a retired law professor and getting a private personalized tour - he asked me earlier why I was coming to Paris and I replied "Cheese and baguettes". I usually cook for my hosts so one evening he bought like 10 different cheeses and we sat and talked about life over some great bottles of red wine
Belgium: Meeting an old friend in Brussels and walking from downtown to the Atomium whilst drinking beers
Really was a random occurrence and shows you how small the world can be
Netherlands: Couchsurfing hosts took me on a personal boat party that was pretty rad
Got to see a lot of Amsterdam that way
I loved Haarlem too
Hungary: Absolutely hanging out on the bridge in Budapest and drinking with new friends
Poland: Getting involved with a pierogi festival and then also randomly having a local decide to give me a 5 hour tour - also had the best hot chocolate of my life
Czechia: it's gotta be when some couchsurfers and local friends that all got together to do a picnic in Prague - imagine a group of 10 all teaching each other songs from their childhood and/or drinking songs
Ended with a couple of them dancing around in a fountain
Germany: I got to Dresden when there was a super heat wave happening (I believe it was around 35-40 C) and as it turned out the father of my couchsurfing host had died two days prior
We shared this amazing bond as we talked about life and death, we discussed romance as he had dealt with a major breakup a year prior and as we explored his city he began giving me personal anecdotes
We are still in contact to this day and it remains one of the most sincere and genuine human interactions I have ever had
Serbia: Stayed with a family who was super awesome
The daughter invited me to stay with them
The mom was like an Italian mother who constantly wanted to feed me
The dad was a gruff man who kept on giving me Rakia as a drink to have with breakfast
There was a lot of adventures such as a random Dutch pancake party that literally 100s of people came out to and the fisherman festival that a giant thunderstorm made us run for the castle
Bulgaria: had an awesome interaction with a host in Sofia that also brought me over to Plovdiv for the museum festival they do
Met a bunch of folks that were part of the festival and had an amazing insider scoop for most of it
Met the person who apparently graffiti'd a large statue and turned it into a superhero
Spain: wandering around Barcelona as a teenager
Switzerland: strolling in the parks along the lake in Zurich
UK: Racing across London on a boris bike at 2AM and manage to catch my train to Luton
France: Hiking through the Calanques national park in Marseille and Cassis
Italy: The lunar landscapes of Cane Malu in Bosa, Sardinia
Malta: Valetta was pretty cool
Bulgaria: Pub crawl in Sofia
Ukraine: Exploring Kiev at night
Poland: Walking along the baltic sea in Sopot
Norway: Driving around the Lofoten Islands and hiking around Kvalvika Beach
Sweden: Skiing in Riksgränsen
Germany: Delicious kebab in Berlin
I arrived in Kiev at 7PM and couldn't resign myself to stop exploring until 2AM, because not only is it a gorgeous city, but it's so lively
Here are some pics from my evening in Kiev:
I take the ambience of a new city, and immediately after, I gtfo and move to the next haha
Except for the first item, all my list above was in the same [crazy 3 week trip] ;)
Is New Caledonia a department or a territory
I've heard they don't have the same level of autonomy
Never seen a stray dog or cat in my city or the cities I have been to
I adopted my dog in Germany 2 years ago, he was in his pregnant mom's belly who was rescued from Romania (what a mouthful
Many of the shelters I visited in Germany often had dogs from Romania and spoke about the bad kill shelters there
Do you know if these shelters are part of the government's measures you mentioned
Québec french is probably one of the closest things french has to a dialect, but even then, while vocabulary and pronunciation are a bit different, the written form is the exact same thing as european french
Germany, although there are many in every country, there are an abundance of job opportunitys in Germany
Also, since I'm soon entering university, studying in Germany, much like Scotland is basically free
Finnish sounds like chickens clucking
That's a bloody shame, because the first song is real groovy

Qu'est-ce que t'as dit sur ma mère
En quelle langue est cette émission
On dirait du français bâtard
On a la "chance" de les côtoyer de près au Canada, alors avec le temps j'ai réussi à décoder quelques mots, mais c'est pas toujours facile
Et encore à l'écrit ça passe, mais si tu entendais le bruit qu'ils font lorsqu'ils essaient de s'exprimer
C'est un bien triste spectacle
Oooooh, on insulte ma mère et après on se trouve des excuses enh

It’s nice to see other countries’ Supreme Courts have an age cap
Ours in Canada have a obligatory retirement age of 75
For us we have 9 justices, but I don’t even know how they get the role
Your average citizen will barely discuss the SC unless a topic comes up and it’s kind of related
I know where’s one from my province but that’s all I know lol
That’s interesting
Does France not have an obligation for sitting members to have any background in law
Is it not a popular post-Presidency activity (serving on the court)
They're appointed by the governor general on the advice of the cabinet, so the governement decides who's going to be a supreme court judge
I can't think of a case where the government made a truly partisan choice though
I know that at least two (or maybe three
) of the judges must be trained with the french civil code because that's what we use in Québec, but appart from that, I also don't know much
Ahh
Cool
You forgot Kraftwerk

I just said this same thing
Isn't he a global superstar
I do it, but I see plenty of people who don’t. So I wouldn’t find you not doing it to be cold in a major city in Canada
The only exception is I would find it cold if it was an empty bus and you walk to past the bus driver in the front without a word and get off
German
Oh so cute <3
There's something about the accent that gets me
Doesn't matter the dialect
They're all beautiful in their own way
And there are certain phrases and words which are cuter in their own way
I love it
I'm instantly attracted
i have a lot of German friends and my exes are Germans and my best friend is also German so i do have a good sample size
And why would they
Do you think Frenchmen expect people to speak to them in French in Ohio
Bananas are fucking delicious though
Such a weird thing to pick out to be derogatory
If you enter my home and refuse to take off your shoes, you better be some kind of trades worker (plumber, electrician, etc) or an inspector or else I’m gonna cut off your hands as a substitute
> we have a hallway without any rugs or carpet, only linoleum, so we can walk with our shoes on there
The hallway is the neutral zone, but the rooms are shoes free
This is perhaps the weirdest answer of them all - you got a hybrid thing going
> Isn't it kind of gross to have people walking around with their sweaty feet on your floor also
Far more preferable than shoes in the house
Yeah your initial explanation was weird but i understand now
We have them in most homes as well here too
A carpet is mandatory though because of the snow
Yes; carpet is the wrong word
We call gnocchi the original poor people food
Came here for this - I was delighted to discover this fun fact when I visited Malta for my honeymoon

I'll keep an eye/ear out then :D
Lucky you
Good luck Netherlands :D
Scotland actually used to have an overseas colony here in Canada called New Scotland, aka Nova Scotia, NS even has Scottish based towns/cities like New Glasgow
On a tangent: wouldnt an EU of city states/regions be far stronger than the current model of countries
It would mean each « body » would be more dependent on each other and the EU network
I think its dumb personally
If you need to FORCE people then it’s not representative at all
Furthermore if you want higher voter turnout, reform the system to make it worth people’s interest
Right now turnouts are generally low due to apathy since for a lot of people their vote doesn’t matter
War crimes or not are a completely independent factor of self determination

I hate Facebook
Win/Win Situation for The EU
Really hope Facebook acts on this threat so a new Social Media platforms can be born and make traction
Bye
Damn, this makes my dream of moving to the Netherlands a little more enticing
"pay their dues"? By what fucking logic do you think facebook owes you anything
Ah, so you just have to the power to try and extort a bunch of money you aren't owed from some innocent third party, so you're going to exercise it
That's the extent of the "logic". That's what I thought
The EU is just a bunch of technocratic tyrants ruling over a compliant serfdom
I pity you people who have to live there
They infested everywhere else
I was a member there and followed what they did
The rhetoric just exists in a lot of other subs
The advantage to FPH was that all of that shit was concentrated in one place
Now it's everywhere
Unintended consequences
Man I hate WhatsApp, it would be great if I could message people on it from FB messenger though
Mabey insta too
Ideally it would become popular for people to use a messanging platform that doesn't scan all your personal message for advertising
>  taxes owed
Facebook doesn't owe you shit
You want money
Go build something yourself, rather than robbing those who *are* willing to do the work to build something
Pathetic
I think they were testing to merge all these apps so avoid anti competitive legislation in the eu
This isn't about taxes, it's about Facebook sharing intel with US authorities and European countries objecting
Well I'm sorry, but that's tough shit
You people voluntarily turned your continent into a bottomless cesspool of islamic militancy, which makes you a danger to the rest of us
You forfeited any right to not be looked on with suspicion by the rest of the world when you chose to do that
Countries like yours are not owed a single dime from the civilized world
**You** should be paying **us** for tolerating your miserable existence
I'll bet the person who put that there would claim to be tolerant, inclusive and not a hateful person at all
Also Brits when they're outside another country:
This is why when I travel I tell people I'm from Canada
Absolutely embarrassed to be an American

Probably canada too

Serious question
Whats to stop say Apple from just including a Lighting to USB adapter inside the box of every device sold in the EU while just raising the price of the devices to offset the cost
I am a little worried about this
One one hand, fuck Apple
On the other, doesn't that impede innovation
If you develop a new charging method, how do you make it proprietary
If you do, how do you sell it when it's not the universal standard
It's not like the standard will be changed to your new and improved one
That would screw over all other other companies which will suddenly be unable to see in the EU

Have there been any consequences whatsoever for whichever bozos made the decision to use that flammable cladding
As a Canadian and a North American I don’t think this is fair for you guys
I have a lot of family who live in Germany France as well as friends in Spain and they live very conservatively
They bike and walk to places and they don’t use AC in this hot weather
Overall, culturally (habits) and statistically most Europeans don’t consume or spend as much as North Americans do
Here in Canada people talk about climate change but their actions don’t match their words
People idle their cars for half an hour just sitting on their phone or wait in a long line of cars just for a cup of coffee at Tim Hortons or a meal at McDonald’s. Street lights turn on at 5 PM when the sun is still up, stores keep their heat / AC and lights on 24 / 7 when there aren’t any customers
Restaurants and stores throw away hundreds of kilograms of food every single day and water is wasted all the time
And that’s only a glimpse of what we waste
On behalf of all Americans and Canadians, I’m sorry that you have to be the ones protesting and taking the consequences while we’re still consuming like there’s no tomorrow
Climate deniers respond by putting nooses around their necks, attached to seedlings
So did they die
I simply just use less
Unfortunately I can’t just bike everywhere because cities in Canada are much larger than Europe, plus our transit system is ass
So my friends and I carpool everyday
For small, mundane things like brushing my teeth, I use a cup and reduce the amount of water coming out, I used to shower longer bur now I shower in 5 mins, I use the fan instead of AC and in the winter I wear warm clothes instead of blasting my heat so high I get a nose bleed
I also started buying less clothes and washing with cold water, drying my clothes by hanging them instead of using the dryer
I replaced all of the lights in my house to LED
I’ve also switched to chicken instead of beef (slowly shifting)
And many more smaller things
Truth is, LED lights don’t use that much energy
It’s the oven, AC, heat, washer/dryer that kill
The big things like meat, transportation (primarily planes) and clothes are the stuff that are causing our death but unfortunately that is way out of our control
I believe anyone can do this but they are just not willing to because of conveniency and comfort
Don’t drag Messi into this
Ah forced labor

These threads get linked to other parts of Reddit and discord’s. We know exactly when since we can see the traffic stats
Hopefully it looks a little better now
I recall learning about what was happening last year in Europe
When quarantine was a radical concept to this young, innocent 21st century mind
I had friends that were saying if they quarantined here in Canada there would be people rioting against it because we wouldn't need it to isolate ourselves enough due to the distances between our cities
Thankfully that didn't happen but this isolation period has gone on for so long due to politicians trying to "stabilize the economy" that's its now destroying our tourism industry for another summer
Short sightedness and greed has increased the death toll here
And I grieve a little everytime I see those numbers
My heart goes out to those who have lost loved ones and those you have recovered but will face unknown challenges in the future
Please keep taking care of yourselves and others
The world united and the miracles of multiple vaccines within a year has been achieved
Something that could have been years in development
Now manufacturing is ramping up to insane levels, another magnificent achievement
Please remember the struggle and I hope the Perseverance from this threat continues drives us to change other policies in the future
Just make it a joke
r/jokes will report every week
I remember the police driving slow through my neighborhood in Milano at the time, repeating a message over the loud speaker to the effect of “There is a national mandatory quarantine
Stay inside for your own protection, the virus is among us”.
Pretty spooky as a foreigner to see, if society collapsed I was definitely not going to be high on any priority list lol
No I voluntarily stayed, and they had my info
I got COVID & recovered by then (April antibody tests confirmed), so I didn’t want to waste resources for something unnecessary
what a bad take
Woke up at 5 am here in Canada and was like welp, it's time to move wayyy the fuck up north
In canada it had all of those and then hatsune miku lol
I hope it's a paid parking lot
Everybody hates those
Ummmm sir I’m going to Paris in May
Maybe the government should disband and declare anarchy before the wretched Yellow Vests strike again

This photo is accurate to how I felt
While it's a striking image and an important reminder that climate change is a big deal, remember that this doesn't necessarily mean all that much in the grand scheme of things, just like how snow in winter doesn't prove climate change is a hoax
Bretagne cool af
Perfectly balanced

Ohio is an American state
Quite the accomplishment that: *not dying* while living a life of luxury, pampered with mountains of cash and batteries of staff to look after your every need

Why do people celebrate royalty again
Note, if she were to dissolve the monarchy -- condemn future generations to actually having to earn their place in society -- that would be impressive and something to celebrate
God her royal majesty the Queen Long May she reign
In Canada at least, in order to abolish the monarchy it would need the approval of both Houses of Parliament and all 10 provincial legislatures
The last time we tried to open the constitution, it almost lead to the breakup of the country
I'd be sad to see the monarchy go
To me, our British traditions (monarchy, parliament, etc)  are the only things keeping us culturally different from the United States
And given what's happened in US politics lately, I want nothing do with that nation
Arguably have children born to the purple was a fantastic way to destroy your legacy in Rome

> Every white person in america can tell you exactly what kind of european descendant they are
??? Europeans are probably the best in the world at sounding fucking stupid while attempting to make a grand sanctimonious point
>Black american people aren't saying white people have no cultures
They're denying the existence of a unified "white culture".
Black Americans don't deny the existence of White American culture
Hahaha how the fuck would someone from *Bulgaria* know
I posted this earlier:
>Like it or not, a "White American" with a midwestern accent, slinging cheeseburgers, watching American Football, practicing his specific brand of 'stars and stripes 'patriotism, and going to his American-style Church, is a man with an entirely unique White American culture

It's meant in the sense of "save yourselves, escape while you can"

It's just that they want to be the women in that equation
Have you seen the man's twitter feed
"Cool" and "Trump" are not words that should ever be used in the same sentence
That's not even a wall, it's an oversized fence
But truly, what personal liberties have been lost
Far right people often hate homosexuals and want to ban homosexuality, and abortion, gay marriage, all things that could be said to be personal liberties
Instead they want to force people into religion and make it state sponsored, that's against personal liberties
Is he the kind of freedom fighter who wants the freedom to pollute as much as possible, without paying any fees for it
Because the far right parties always are into that, and against environmental protections (i.e. other people's freedom to breathe clean air instead of poison
Huh I always imagined that part of the world has had snow before
Canadians who got snow starting in September:

Prague is such a beautiful city
I had a chance to study abroad there for a month prior to the pandemic
I wish it had snowed like this

Non-European here -- what jurisdiction does the ECHR have over Russian trials given that Russia is not an EU member
I know my ww2 history and seeing a polish man doing that type of salute is more then bizarre to me
Maybe the camera just caught him at the moment he was waving

My late Oma (grandma) lived through this
She talked about it sometimes
She said they were so desperate for food they ate flower pedals
She also said they used to steal wood from Nazi fortifications for firewood
Her family also housed allied weapons in their basement, despite the obvious death if caught
So that's kind of badass

I guess they forgot that 38% of people in Scotland voted in favour of Brexit
That's not insignificant
In  any case, it's spiteful of the EU to use this as an opportunity to deepen the wedge between Scotland and the rest of the UK, and I say that as someone with no dog in this fight
If they'd wanted to be classy about it, they could have combined the words "United Kingdom" and "Europe". That would have shown there aren't any hard feelings, but clearly there are

We recently strengthened our net neutrality laws
Germany that's highly praises here was the key vote in swinging for that actually, whereas France that's typically the butt of some joke was the one trying to stop it from continuing

Because the PM isn't directly elected
When you vote you vote for your local member of parliament to represent your riding in government
From there, the Queen then chooses someone from parliament who has the confidence of parliament to run the government as PM

Practically that means the leader of the largest party in parliament is chosen to be PM, as it can be assumed they have their parties support, and therefore have the most support in parliament out of any other MP
This leads to people voting more with the leader of the party in mind more than the MP
For example, if you want the Labour leader to be your PM, you vote for your Labour MP
Most don't even consider their MPs stance on certain issues compared to the official party's stance
If of course parliament looses confidence in their ability to lead government, a vote of no-confidence is held and if they loose their no long PM
When a PM resigns the new leader of their party is chosen as PM as it can be said that since they have the largest party begins them, they have the confidence of Parliament
Of course this doesn't mean Johnson isn't an elected official
He was elected MP in his riding, just as all other PMs were

The idea is that if a candidate is from a disadvantaged group, they will have had a more difficult time achieving the same things as someone who isn't as disadvantaged, so they will in fact be more competent than their metrics suggest
For example, if you have one candidate who came from a rich family and one who came from a poor family, and they have the same grade point average, you can be fairly certain that the person from a poor family had to work harder for it than the person from the rich family
Thus it makes sense to hire the poor person, all else being equal
Now I'm sure everyone will be eager to argue that women aren't disadvantaged, but I just wanted to point out that it does make sense to consider more about the person you're hiring than just their grades, or work experience, or other simple metrics

By the way, blocking major bridges forces Emergency Services ( Advanced Care Paramedics, Commanders, Doctors, Police and Fire Brigade etc
) to have to plan alternative routes to get to patients - some of whom are in life threatening emergencies
A single bridge block can make a 5 minute ETA into a 30 minute ETA
That 25 minute difference could mean that a Cardiac Arrest patient will die, a Stroke patient may be permanently brain damaged, a Trauma patient may bleed out completely

I am both as Anglo-Saxon and as shamelessly anti-nationalist as it gets, and even *I* can admit that Scotland ought to leave the UK post-Brexit
I was moderately against Scotland leaving during its independence referendum, but after Brexit I'm now one hundred in favor of Scottish independence
Staying in the EU was a major reason behind Scotland's decision to stay in the UK, and forcing them to leave the EU one way or another against their will was a colossal dick move on England's part

I live In BC and were not as touchy about nudity here
I mean, I guess in a public park with lots of people someone would get their panties in a twist, but places like the beach, lakes and rivers are fine
We also have naked bike ride day in Vancouver but that's cancelled because of COVID
Overall, I think our country should be making laws more lenient
Nudity in nature imo is perfectly fine
But most of our nudity laws are outdated and barely ever enforced, so they need to be updated
I'm not really as supportive of nudity in high traffic areas though, because it presents a health safety issue
That looks like something that I’d draw
Looks like something I could draw in about 5 minutes XD

Corruption is a serious problem, but to pretend it isn't rampant throughout Europe (in a variety of forms) can only be a willful blind spot
Born in Bulgaria but have been living in Canada for many years
It's not that there's no corruption here
There's corruption everywhere
The problem is that when they steal 25 billion in Canada, that's 1
5% of the GDP
When they steal 25 billion in Bulgaria, that's 44% of the GDP

I almost forgot how big ISIS used to be, seems all countries involved with obliterating them from the sky did a great job
This is a good point, however I think it's worth acknowledging that a) the Jim Crow era (back when lynchings were a thing) is significantly worse than "an incompetent actor as president", and really ended only ~50 years ago, and b) the world has changed a lot in the past few decades with regards to the dissemination of information (thus greatly empowering speech)
This empowerment is generally a good thing, as it generally empowers 'good' speech (e.g. the vast majority of communication by professionals), but it also empowers negative speech (e.g. people advertising racist views) and gives the ability for once fringe ideas to latch onto people's emotions and gain a following (see incels)
You can see that this is recent empowerment is most people's concern because the vase majority of talk of silencing is about modern media (social media); people rarely, if ever, talk about shutting down newspapers, books, radio, even film (although occasionally speeches)
You can still think that total free speech should be a thing (although it should be pointed out that defamation, harassment, and threats are exempted from this totality), but relying *solely* on a continuity of history seems a bit risky to me
I think there's a time and place (the middle ground)
No problem restricting intolerance from the majority of social settings, so long as there is a place for it (e.g. banning it from the majority of subreddits, but not from reddit in general)
You don't want to allow a platform for them to advertise their views, nor an opportunity for the harassment of those they discriminate against (including hate speech)
That said, you also want to be aware of hate so to keep an eye on it and be able to engage with the honest people of the movement whose racism may yet be changed (e.g. people who are not malicious, but ignorant/unaware of the goals and importance of social justice and its contemporary forms)
It's good to have places where people can be open about this (for the possibility of rehabilitation, among other reasons), but there's no reason that this needs to have the freedom be anywhere
It seems we disagree on many things (particularly on what is social justice, which is a whole other can of worms---I suspect the social justice you and I see differ greatly)
I don't really know the source of our disagreements because you haven't really given any explanation or argument---your only point you have made is that you don't want ideology festering underground in your original post, which is what my previous comment addresses---but I will do my best to state my points
Regarding the first point, people are rarely rational, and often far more emotionally driven
Allowing for the advertisement of Nazi (e.g.) ideology allows these ideologies to capitalize on this irrational state by connecting with these emotions (this is how you get things like immigration control---which is not inherently partisan---being conflated with the far right)
If you do not want these people to grow their following, it is simplest to cut off their recruitment
Regarding the second, I'm not entirely sure what you disagree with
Are you saying that this type of harassment should be tolerated
> I don't think that people flocking to extremism happens because extremism is allowed freedom to speak
It happens through high levels of dissatisfaction (and/or poor education)
I think it's because of both reasons
You see this especially with youth, discontent leads them to look for 'rebellious' perspectives, and they generally latch on to one of the first ones that appeals to them
These movements do engage in recruitment efforts, and they do it because it works
We agree that it's important to create an environment where racism/etc
cannot thrive (although I'd maybe use the higher bar of an environment where discrimination not only doesn't thrive, but where it doesn't persist)
However, for me part of this process is ensuring that these movements cannot gain a following in the meantime
And shutting down the promotion of these ideologies is certainly one method of doing so
> The issue with restricting freedoms is that it sounds good until the people you don't agree with are in charge
Let's be clear, I am not talking about silencing people I merely disagree with
I disagree with you, and I think it would be unacceptable for your statements to be silenced
Obviously a much higher bar is necessary
It's also worth pointing out that if some of the speech I would consider acceptable to restrict got power, I'd have much bigger concerns than my speech (namely my and my family's life, livelihood, home)
This is why it is hard for me to agree with you that it's *always* morally unjustifiable to curtail speech (although of course it is often unjustifiable)
For example, I think it certainly would've been morally justified (or imperative) to break up Nazi rallies around 1930
This doesn't necessarily translate to movements today, but it is why I disagree with your absolute value of free speech
> I'm saying that if you get harassed on an anonymous board then you can close your web browser (and how the hell to people even know what to harass you with
Or you can trust reddit's voting system, which curtails this shit even on loosely moderated boards
De-platforming doesn't work, it just pushes things underground
I agree with you on your last point (and it's something I have addressed above), but it's worth pointing out that not all harassment is over the internet (and real life harassment is that much more harmful)
Furthermore harassment on reddit (with its anonymity and discussion format) is significantly less persistent than on media like twitter where it's a lot more difficult to escape or ignore since it's tied with your account
This harassment can be quite pernicious and exhausting, I personally could not wish it on anyone
> See, here's the thing
Hate speech isn't "hateful speech" it's "speech that the current powers hate". It's not a precedent I want
This is something where I think we have more in common
I think much speech harmful to the powers that be is already impeded, if not restricted (for example, threats of defamation suits ensure that you have to be very careful when criticizing these powers)
Frankly, I don't see many of the victims of 'hate speech' having much power in my country, so I don't see much justification for your interpretation of the phrase
I personally am comfortable with the precedent of targeting 'hateful speech' (to use your phrase), so long as the legal definition of the term is both clear and well maintained (so as to keep it from being a tool of tyranny)
I think Canada has a [decent example] of such a definition to my amateur eye, although I'm sure there is a higher standard
> I think this modern push by governments to curtail free speech is the exact same
They use a boogeyman (the far right) to try to get the average person to give up more of their rights to the government
It's interesting, because I think for a lot of far right movements the government is the boogeyman
I think this "the government wants your rights" argument applies to some countries, but not for many
I certainly don't buy it with respect to Canada: the party in power changes frequently enough that it wouldn't work as a partisan motivation (the parties are too busy pushing policies that appeal to their base), and it's hard to see any long term trend that would mark a bipartisan (or institutional) push
I am curious how you see this happening in your own country
I also think it's worth distinguishing 'free speech' meaning freedom from government regulation, 'free speech' meaning free from community/corporate regulation (like facebook/subreddit censorship), and 'free speech' meaning freedom from all regulation (like protesters shouting down a speaker)
My arguments are generally agnostic about what ends up shutting down intolerance, but there are different concerns for each of them (some of which you have raised)
This Trump voter shoulda just went to Charlottesville instead

"Liberal and conservative at the same time
" is amusing to me in context since that's basically the Democratic Party in the US
It's generally a result of a plurality (FPTP) system vs proportional system that yields these results
The main reason we don't have as much of that in Canada as in the US probably has to do with our politics being somewhat more regional in many cases
The smug tone of this is hilarious

I know this thread and topic is specific to the European theater and on Germany; but if there's one take away it's how easy it is to overlook contributions from others
Chang Kai Shek fought with the knowledge it was unwinnable against the Japanese but wanted to show the Allies he was serious to try and muster any available support against Japan while fighting on his own
We're talking about an estimated 3 to 4 million military dead or missing on the Chinese side fighting against Japan
This is not even mentioning just how brutal the fighting was given how the Japanese military command viewed the Chinese (another 7-8 million civilian deaths due to military activity)

I work in the machining industry and I am Canadian
So we have customers who order both metric and fractioned tools
Its fuckin lame
I MUCH prefer metric tools
Kinda glad us Canadians stuck with the Metric System as well
It definitely is less of a mess
I mean, while measuring height is more often done in feet and inches, and is one way the metric system isn't too confusing, I do know doctors use centimeres on official documents and such
Metric time keeping is the worst thing I have ever heard of
Good luck with that
Back when they first made imperial units, it was really difficult to divide things up evenly in anything other than 2
So they measure things in halves (1/2), quarters ((1/2)/2), eighths (((1/2)/2)/2), sixteenths ((((1/2)/2)/2)/2), etc
It makes perfect sense
64ths is (1/2)^(6)
It was also the basis for the Fahrenheit scale (0 is freezing point of brine, 32 is freezing point of water
Draw 2 lines, divide in half 5 times and now you've got 32 degrees marked out)

> The abortion can be done only during first 12 weeks if the pregnancy was a result of a criminal act ie rape
From what I've read most of these are not carried out because Polish courts don't move fast enough to prove a rape within 12 weeks
Serbia is already a shit hole
Still will be when all the western countries turn into Pakistan, in fact
>This court ruling removes the grounds upon which the vast majority of abortions take place in Poland
In 2017, Polish government data reported that 1,035 of the 1,057 abortions (97
9%) that took place were on the grounds of severe foetal anomaly
The proportion of abortions carried out on this ground has steadily increased every year since 1994: while abortions to preserve life or health accounted for 88
1% of all legal abortions in 1994, by 2017 they had fallen to 2
1%.
> Meanwhile, abortion on the grounds of rape is vanishingly rare in Poland today
In 2017, not a single termination on these grounds was granted, in a country of 38 million people
> Obtaining a legal abortion in Poland already took weeks or months because of administrative barriers and opposition from obstructive doctors, and these delays will be exacerbated by the new ruling
> In some regions of eastern Poland, it is effectively impossible to obtain an abortion because all medical facilities have declared themselves conscientious objectors to abortion
In other regions, legal advocates report that anti-abortion doctors deliberately delay patients, mislead them about their legal entitlement to abortion, or tell them that such procedures are not available in their region
> "In practice it takes weeks, sometimes months," to obtain a legal abortion, said Karolina Wieckiewicz, a lawyer and activist with the group Abortion Without Borders (Polish: Aborcja bez granic)
"Some people decide to risk the battle in Poland; others look for alternatives
It's not easy to be granted a legal abortion in Poland, even before the recent ruling
I'm not sure I could keep my balance while pulling a stroller like that

Don’t you guys get seasonal depression though
It helps if you believe in it
There's no evidence for vitamin supplements preventing depressive symptoms in the winter
Not even vitamin D, it's just a myth that seems to have spread everywhere
Yes, there is a correlation between vitD levels and depressive symptoms
But guess what, there a pretty significant confounding factor: the sun
Supplementing with vitamin d helps depression just as much as not eating ice cream prevents drowning
High vitD is just a marker of getting sunlight, and sunlight prevents depression
Here's a couple of randomized, double-blinded studies showing no effect of vitamin D supplementation on the seasonal affective disorder or depression:
That could do the trick
Also modern sunbeds emit UVB so you get vitamin D from them
There's the skin cancer risk though so I wouldn't overdo it
When I still lived in Finland I would sometimes go to the sunbed during the winter, not so much for the tan, but because it made me feel awesome after not feeling the sun on my skin for months
Instant mood boost
Sure, that I agree with
However the main and perhaps only benefit is better bone health, and even there a medium dose is better than high as recent placebo-controlled trials have shown
Long-lasting vitD supplementation has failed to prevent for example cancer, diabetes, allergies (to name a few) despite the big hype 10-15 years ago
It's seems evident now that the reason for the correlation between high vitD levels and health is that people who are more active (outdoors) and have better diets, also have better vitD status

Not sure if Nunavut passed Quebec yet either
Italians have the better cuisine, the French have the technique
French cuisine isn’t nearly as popular as Italian cuisine worldwide, but French cooking techniques are used everyday by many people across the world
Both cultures have contributed immensely to food/cooking culture, but nothing beats Italian cuisine
Fair, I don't have the numbers
That statement was based on my personal experience, you're right
In my opinion, though, I don't think French cuisine is less popular in North America for any reason other than that it seems to be less accessible than Italian food
Most French restaurants in North America - at least in my experience - are high-end and are usually somewhere you'd go exclusively for dinner
There aren't many places (outside Quebec, perhaps) that offer French "fast food", if you will
With that being said though, pâtisserie are quite common here and are only growing in popularity, which I didn't originally take into account when I made the statement about Italian cuisine being more popular
Regardless, French cuisine is legendary and France has probably contributed more overall to the culinary arts in the West than any other nation
Quebec cuisine is heavily inspired by French cuisine (of course), but they’re not the same
France could never produce the absolute monstrosity that is poutine
That’s something only the harsh winters of Quebec can produce

Depends on where you go

Poutine might be extremely simple, but it’s also really easy to fuck it up, kind of like pizza

Having more consumers is good for corporate profits
Ditto for other neoliberal politicians
Leftists, if in power, would also keep welcoming them in, not for the benefit of corporations, but to do otherwise would be offensive
And then there's Le Pen, but the French people seem to want to try everything except for actually solving the problem
Macron is a neoliberal on steroids
Neoliberals aren't "lefties" though, but their end game is the same as the far right
Neoliberals tend to sprinkle just enough "progressive" social policies to get progressives to vote for them while said progressives have their unions busted and their jobs exported to China or India

Regardless of the decision made, I think it's really fucked up how many EU Europeans like to squash anyone that go against them in the slightest
You all do the same thing to the US and Russia while maintaining that you're somehow superior
Maybe try to be more like the Canadians where they at least pretend to be nice
You mean pawing the way for human spaceflight

The ECJ has already ruled that monitoring of online activity is prohibited
As enforcement of Article 13 requires monitoring, this is a good angle of attack
This was expressly stated by academics years ago, as the article was in violation of the Charter and contradicted article 15 of the e-commerce directive
Source: my wife was one of said academics (PhD, copyright law)
(Just checked with the wife so I don't say anything stupid)
Article 15 basically says that the state can't oblige intermediaries to monitor activities
The keyword here is *intermediaries*.  The state can monitor you all it wants (indeed the UK is rather obsessed with this), but it can't oblige Google to do its dirty work
There's nothing stopping Google from doing it on its own accord (read: ContentID), but the state can't impose that
Of course, this doesn't mean that governments don't try anyway (*cough snooper's charter cough*) but that doesn't make it legal
Filtering requires monitoring, as you can't make a decision about whether you should filter something without first monitoring for it
This alone means Article 13 of this bill violates 15 of the other
I mean, you can use the ghosts to open bottles as well

Do cars in Europe come with "block heaters"?
Here in Canada almost every car is sold with a block heater that you can plug into which keeps the oil warm when the car is not running
It makes cars start so much easier this way
I have a really strong armchair interest in the world before 1914 and for anyone that can read French this is a really cool book:
It's basically a travel blog by a French journalist who lived in Germany and goes around visiting places and interviewing people
He's really positive about it, actually
The book has about 400 pictures as well, four or so every few pages as you read along

I always find it interesting that Reddit often says that right now we're living in the worst time possible and people shouldn't have children
Bitch you don't think people who lived through WW1, WW2, the Spanish Flu etc
had it worse
You seriously think that right now as you type from the comfort of your own home on your super computer $1k phone is worse than the people who went thru that shit
And they still had kids
They still had hope for a future, as per "the war to end all wars

They've done wonders repairing and redoing the layouts over the last few years
More parks and pedestrian space and less ugly street stores
4-5 thousand people that showed up in Moscow are a pittance
More people show up for Starbucks opening
In Toronto Canada they started doing the bike lanes between the parked cars and the sidewalk
so it’s sidewalk, bike lane, parking and then street so the cyclists are completely away from the street
works well
Sadly it's not really surprising with no cure and no vaccine the best you can is delay the spread
And unless a cure or vaccine is developed all of the world's countries are going to end up in roughly the same place it's just a question of when
I wonder what the history books will say
Did the rest of the world boondoggle the response because the second wave hit outside care homes harder or will the USA non response be viewed as a success because they didn't tank their economy with lockdowns

I just recently got back from visiting Japan
The apartments in Tokyo or any of the surrounding cities are TINY
The bathrooms in a few of the places I stayed in were so compact that the sinks moved over to cover the toilet so you could shower (all in one room, no shower curtain, etc
if that makes sense)
Taking the railway system during rush hour is nuts
Just when you think you can't fit anymore people in one of the cars, ten more squeeze in somehow
They even have designated cars for "women only" for those that fear they'll be groped or something (but women are still welcome to ride on the other cars)
That being said, not all of Japan is like that
Kyoto and Osaka were pretty comfortable
The few things mentioned above certainly made for an experience, and not a negative one
Just a completely different lifestyle than what a lot of us are used to
In Finland only half of the population is currently complaining about the heat
The other half is complaining about the ones complaining about the heat
I remember in high school, I was doing research in art class, and looking up a reference photo of a German tank, as I wanted to draw a piece of a battle scene where it was in the centre, getting straffed by an aircraft
After some time a teacher that came to talk with my art teacher saw my work and asked me about it
I told him the general layout and we got to talking about the war and the occupation (I told him that my grandmother grew up in occupied Netherlands among other things), and about a book I was reading for English Class, about a boy who was sent with his sibling and mother from Hungary in 1944 to the contration camp system
And he then showed me a video he took on his phone from a visit to one of the concentration camp museums
It was 2-3 minutes long, and all it was all shoes
Stacked in massive piles, from one side of the warehouse, to the other
Meters deep, on both walls, with a corridor to walk through
And the video was just him walking in the corridor, pexi glass pane after the next of just stacks of leather shoes
For minutes
At that point I've seen standard documentary footage of War Crimes from that time
The guy gets shot in the head and falls in the pit, the burning peasants house in the eastern front, the London Blitz, the liberated camp survivors barely able to stand
But that video gave me a new perspective
A visual of numbers so enormous I couldn't even guess how many people those shoes belonged to
People who wouldn't be able to own a second or spare pair of shoes, people who lived and loved, people who used to exist
I don't understand how anyone would be able to deny that people were shot, burnt, starved, and erased from the face of the earth in 6 years
Glad you didn't post the piles of golden tooth crowns
I remember the Romans did the same thing after conquering Gaul
Horse-led carts would trot through the streets of Rome as returning soldiers would throw gifts - loot - into the crowd
This was a part of Julius Caesar’s way of siding with/pleasing the mob, further maintaining them in his corner
Other people’s personal possessions and the sentimental values attached to them were completely erased

Do you have a link to a story about this
I can't find word of this happening anywhere other than this comment
I'm not even British or European but even I know you just took a picture of the trash news section

It's so weird to me hearing how Scandinavians are getting less snow than I've been getting in Eastern Ontario (fairly south in Canada), on a weirdly warm winter

Another similar letter to look at, with similar "colourful" language is the Cossacks letter to the sultan, [
That reads as, from wikipedia:
"Zaporozhian Cossacks to the Turkish Sultan
O sultan, Turkish devil and damned devil's kith and kin, secretary to Lucifer himself
"What the devil kind of knight are thou, that canst not slay a hedgehog with your naked arse
The devil shits, and your army eats
"Thou shalt not, thou son of a whore, make subjects of Christian sons
We have no fear of your army; by land and by sea we will battle with thee
Fuck thy mother
"Thou Babylonian scullion, Macedonian wheelwright, brewer of Jerusalem, goat-fucker of Alexandria, swineherd of Greater and Lesser Egypt, pig of Armenia, Podolian thief, catamite of Tartary, hangman of Kamyanets, and fool of all the world and underworld, an idiot before God, grandson of the Serpent, and the crick in our dick
Pig's snout, mare's arse,  slaughterhouse cur, unchristened brow
Screw thine own mother
" So the Zaporozhians declare, you lowlife
You won't even be herding pigs for the Christians
Now we'll conclude, for we don't know the date and don't own a calendar; the moon's in the sky, the year with the Lord

Where was your great wisdom before the vote
I don't like this graph
They are categorizing nuclear in a bad way IMO
On the flip-side, burning of biomass (wood) is considered "renewable", even though that's only the case over the short term
The forests here in Nova Scotia are currently being clear-cut and shipped to Europe and other markets to be burned for electricity
The problem with that (aside from the carbon emissions) is that [clear-cutting is unsustainable
] Every time it happens, the soil is degraded of nutrients and also erodes, until eventually it's not capable of supporting a forest
Greece is somewhat up there

I think that's why the USA will always have a class divide
We make a lot in our family and the idea of moving someplace with higher taxation than we already have (Quebec) really starts to sting
Between income taxes, property taxes and sales taxes, I think we're lucky to keep 35% of our income
If/when you reach the point where you go "Why is the government entitled to more of my money than I am
", you start to think about places with less taxation more favourably
Thus the class divide
A better tax situation is going to attract more people with money
> Didn't really expect so many people to oversimplify the problems of the US to "scary minorities" and "lack of homogeneity".
Why does that surprise you
Minorities are not well-treated
When you force people into a lower caste, how do you expect them to be homogenous

There's a gruesome movie on Netflix called [Nazi Concentration Camps] It was produced in 1945-46 as evidence for the Nuremberg Trials, and has not been altered before being uploaded to Netflix
A narrator describes the conditions, purposes, and horrors of each camp used by the Nazis
One by one, their names briefly appear on the screen before footage proceeds to show bodies piled upon bodies, corpses clinging to life, and Allied soldiers and medics trying to make sense of the autrocities
During this, the narrator calmly describes what took place
Within minutes, they move to the next camp
Despite each camp being given only a brief overview, the film is about an hour long
It is horrifying, very NSFL, and does not try to answer any of the "big questions" to help us make sense of it all
And yet, I truly believe that it is a must see for everyone who is trying to learn more about the Holocaust
We often hear of the major camps and the gas chambers, and I've heard a bit about other aspects of the Holocaust, but I truly did not grasp the sheer scale and impersonal bureaucracy of the Holocaust until viewing this film
If you don't have Netflix, [you can also watch Nazi Concentration Camps (in lower quality) here
In case you still need some persuading since this is quite sad to learn about, I'll finish this comment with the words enshrined on the monument marking the mass grave at the Majdanek death camp
Don't let their deaths be in vain

I was going to say "We get 28 Celsius in Western Canada every Summer, nearly every day". But I forget that in the western part of Canada \(the prairies\), it's a dry heat, which is so much easier to put up with than humid heat

You could say that, Finland is

Heck during most winter I keep heating to 10 “just in case” but the building is generally warm enough

I can't help but wonder if glass towers like these will become increasingly anachronistic in the post Coivd-19 world
We're already seeing the IT and financial sectors of the economy moving permanently towards having many people working from home, and anybody who spent the quarantine trapped inside a tiny downtown condominium has come to the appreciate what it must be like to have a backyard

Its sad to see his sacrifice is unable to be remembered this year but I am sure it will be next year when this situation is under control
Damn I was close
"The wall contains eleven urns with soil from World War II execution grounds and war cemeteries in each of the Dutch provinces
Ill chalk it up to enjoying too many beers afterwards
I’m glad to know that his sacrifice and that of others are still remembered
I do wish I could have met him but I guess knowing he did his part so others could know their grandparents will have to be enough

Fk "khrushchyovki".
I'm sorry mate, but it's really not a matter of guesswork at this point
It's a matter of what's already been demonstrated to work
The UN, WHO, and a number of NGOs have been running education campaigns on the matter in developing nations for over two decades now, and targeting women is ultimately what has proven to be most effective
It's what's responsible for the massive reduction of rates in nations like Sudan, where rates among women aged 15–49 sat at 87% back when the data was collected in 2016, while ages 0–14 were down to 32%.
Or Ethiopia, the nation your study is about, which went from 74% to 24%. Egypt went from 87% to 14%, Eritrea went from 83% to 33%, Guinea went from 97% to 46%, Burkina Faso went from 76% to 13%, and Sierra Leone went all the way from 90% to 13%.
I don't want to come across as disrespectful or anything, but the reality of the situation is that you've really only done the most cursory bit of research into the matter
The actual experts and professionals who have dedicated themselves to this issue have built their stance on a far more thorough understanding the matter better than either of us have, and on the basis of real-world evidence which ultimately points toward specifically targeting "the most FGM wanting group of the community" being the most effective course of action
Keep in mind that it's a chart which includes everyone up to 49 year olds, and the world has changed quite a bit over the past 50 years
For comparison, [here's a chart on the 15-49 age group] using the same data as the map above, and [here's a chart on the 14 and under age group] which is much more reflective of current rates, though not quite as widely encompassing in terms of the number of countries surveyed
All data is from 2016, and rates have continued to fall since then

Honestly, this isn't exclusive to America either
I often heard stories from former peers here in Canada about their parents doing that shit to them
Most of them are from outside the metropolitan centers, so they're basically (culturally) not too far removed from Suburban America
Here in Toronto you see the opposite
Lot of immigrants and generations of families from across Europe, South Asia, and East Asia
All cultures where the kids staying home *forever* or just a really long time until they're settled financially and career wise, isn't exactly new
Cultural reasons, plus economic reasons with housing being absurdly expensive means if we have it good might as well stay (we inherent many aspects from our neighbors to the south and the perception of housing as a luxury not a necessity is one of them)
I don't know a single person who was born and raised in my city that moved out of their parents homes
Sounds just like North America
I would know, as a Canadian
Happy to be living in Finland now though, but it's presently rather tough to find a job here too, especially since I only speak a modicum of Finnish
That's one of their aqua ducks

Rest of the song:
*Our Scottish friend still clad in kilt continued down the street*
*He hadnt gone 10 yards or more
when a girl he chanced to meet*
*She said, Ive heard whats under there,
Please tell me if its so
*He said,Why dont you reach right up,
And give yourself a go
*She stuck her hand right up his kilt
And Great was her surprise
*She looked up at the Scotsman
He had twinkles in his eyes*
*She cried,Why Sir thats gruesome
And then she heard him roar*
*He said,If you reach up once again
Youll find its grew some more
*The Scotmans Hands were numb with drink
His head was spinning round
*He couldnt get that ribbon off
So homeward he was bound*
*His wife she caught a flash of blue
As he took off all his clothes*
*And it piqued her curiosity
as you might well suppose
*Well then she asked that Scotsman*
*Where hed been and what hed done*
*He said there was a contest at the pub
And that hed won*
*She cried, You did not show that thing
In front of all those men
*I did not show it all my love
But just enough to win
I like how Greece and North Macedonia are still next to each other and can still be mad at each other
Show this to your geography teacher without context
Austrians in Hungary, I’ve seen this one before
Same story with North Macedonia and Greece

"Thanks for the help guys, seriously
Anyway, fuck your stability"
Canada has had 23 PMs since 1867
Only 4 between 1900-1948
12 since 1948
If you take out all the ones that never actually won an election
We've had 16 since 1867
6 between 1867-1948
Forced leadership changes can often turn into crownings, just as they can when there are none
Russia is actually a perfect example of this, as they initially had presidential term limits
Putin and the party put up Dmitry Medvedev as their chosen successor, crowning him as President
They then got rid of term limits and returned Putin to the presidency
I like how they look like a spartan helmet

Are you just appealing to my sense of standing up for misrepresented people though
Is OP trying to misrepresent things for some reason
I dunno
Both of you are claiming you are right with no sources
Obviously it's my responsibility to research on my own but still, ffs, posters and commenters alike keep making all these claims and no one ever sources
Well now I want to visit the Netherlands and get arrested for something nice and small

Do those countries not give Visas to skilled workers
> Having the chance to apply for a Visa is not the same as an unrestricted right to move and then just say "oh hi, I'm here now".
I didn't say it was, but generally for skilled workers it'll most likely be a straightforward process to getting work in other countries, Canadians have to do it to work in the states
They have to actually pass a plan first though, right
I legit don't understand if that's a foregone conclusion, or if their politicians are able to just keep kicking that can down the road
Oh dang, that's harsh
I thought there was still a chance it wasn't going to go through
Yeah, I just wrongly assumed that not getting anything done would result in not leaving the EU at all
Oh man, I really love these
We even have something similar in [Toronto] and my goal is to buy one someday
The American military industrial complex is a thousand times more corrupt and bureaucratic than any European institution could ever be
Yet somehow they manage to have a competent army
An EU army would be a million times leaner, more competitive and controlled
And it would also get along with Russia
That's why the US fears the possibility
Seems like an off idea to me, but I'm a grungy north american
You would integrate the army
The affect of the World Wars on US integration (the centralized American identity overtaking regional and state identities in the imaginations of the troops and personnel) was notable
Racial integration (still a long ways to go since Americans for the most part are extremely racist still) also was boosted by integration in the army early on (relative to civil rights movements of the 60s)
This is literally all caused by the **British**. Wherever they go, they fuck shit up
- India + Pakistan
- Israel + Palestine
- Cyprus
My grandfather got severe PTSD peacekeeping in syprus with the PPCLI
(Princess Patricia Canadian Light Infantry)
The problem is that some random British guy who went to India once was charged with drawing a border that separated millions
He couldn’t have done a worse job if he tried
I don’t blame him though, he was pressured by the government
The colonial administration wanted to get out of India as soon as possible because it was bleeding them dry
And this is why the Canada/USA border needs to stay closed for the foreseeable future
We're going to Georgia later next month, they have the largest aquarium in the world 'Georgia Aquarium'. Even have whale sharks, only place outside of Asia to have them I believe
Georgia the country reminds me of Columbia

Can someone explain to me how Turkey legalized relationships in 1858 even though they weren’t founded till after WW1
Did some of the laws of the Ottomans just carry over to their territory’s when they dissolved, or am I just stupid and missing a larger picture
For me, I just can’t see the Ottomans legalizing Homosexuality, but could be wrong
Wow, I didn't realize the French revolution did that

So he has to wear them hiking if he has shorts on or pants on, and it's a lot cooler to wear them with shorts
I have varicose veins, and if I don't wear them after a couple hours of hiking they start to ache
They are super lame looking so I wear pants as much as possible but there is only so much you can take

My first visit to Europe was to visit my parents when my father was stationed at the Canadian base in Baden
They casually mentioned that the nondescript little town they lived in had just had its 1000th birthday, making it around the same age as L'Anse Aux Meadows and therefore older than all European settlement in my whole continent
My mind was blown
A little while later I visited Rome and Paris (among other places) and what little mind I had left was further blown at the experience of seeing ruins twice that old
To make a long story short, one of my hobbies now is European history, and I have now seen Roman ruins in about a dozen cities
Means city of the monks iirc
Yeah, that's the one I knew

Vaara for fell or mountain is a loan word from Sámi, related to vuori, whereas vaara for danger is from Swedish fara

Any argument you have against Britain leaving the EU is an even better argument against Scotland leaving the UK
Man, I remember being on Reddit during the Scottish independence referendum in 2014
Seemed like there were so many Americans on here that were cheering it on, saying things like "1776 was our year and 2014 will be yours
" Like wtf it has nothing to do with you
As a Canadian though, I think I have natural aversion to these things
I imagine the reason is to make sure the message is clear to as many people as possible because there are a lot of super stupid people who would interpret things the wrong way and start a shitstorm over it
I think there is some truth to your point of some people wanting to see the UK suffer just because
Especially after Brexit, which I think many on here were against and who viewed it as a slight against them once it happened
Yeah and I get that
If I were from the UK, I probably would have voted Remain but that is besides the point
My point is that, partially due to Brexit, many here on this site have opinions regarding the UK that are, shall we say, overly emotional
And I think some here want to see the UK fail simply for the schadenfreude
Wait, so I have your silly old queen as head of state in Canada, but she isn't the head of state a couple of miles down the M5

This sort of thing defintly happens among different English speakers
The British are the masters of not saying what they mean, and that can mess with Americans and Canadians as well
The main one that comes mind is that British people will often say hello by saying something like "you alright
". They're not actually enquiring about how you are, you're just expected to respond fine or can't complain
When I moved to Canada I realised how often I did this, because a few Canadians were confused and assumed that I was implying something was wrong because I was asking them if they were alright
That sounds more like what Brits mean than, say, Aussies
(Am I right
Is Canada basically Dutch
I say all the things on the left but actually mean all the things on the right
You are thinking about it wrong
It's not a question, it's a verbal handshake

To be fair US President Barack Obama was hated for saying his opinion about Brexit, that EU should stay united and that he was against the UK leaving, and actually made a threat that the UK would be at the back of the line

Even though he was an ardent Marxist and an anti-imperialist, his dystopia still involved Britain losing its Empire and Superpower status before becoming a subordinate partner to America
Wow it looks remarkably like the USA electoral map

Yeah, and I realize I'm probably being anglocentric here, but I don't think I'd ever have a use for a term that means "UK, Ireland, Netherlands, Belgium, and parts of France". Even if you tweaked the boundaries a bit, it still seems like a pretty arbitrary chunk of Europe to talk about as a unit, so I'm having trouble seeing how this is supposed to be useful
Pretty sure the UN also classifies Britain and Ireland as Northern Europe though, doesn’t it

No clue what he means by “blanket company”. The HBC actually acted as a de facto government in the parts of Canada that they owned (which, until 1869, was a lot of land)

Ugly, but looks better than the rest of Poland
>Did you forget Warsaw was bombed to smithereens
This argument falls apart because it essentially validates the idea that all new cities, and all new developments MUST fall into the uniform global style, rather than reflect any kind of new developments along local cultural identity
Why is it Poles could build cultural buildings prior to WW2, but not today
Except that when Warsaw was rebuilt following the Deluge, I'm willing to bet the city still looked distinctly Polish, and not like a piece of Shanghai
Not even slightly diverse in comparison
Only a few metropolitan areas of Canada are diverse

I don’t really agree with this statement, and maybe it’s because I’m an outsider, but hear me out, because many of the most influential and passionate Finnish language and culture proponents of the nineteenth century who played key roles in the development of Finland and its culture were Finland Swedes by upbringing and origin
Snellman, Lönnrot, Aleksis Kivi (born Alexis Stenvall), Akseli Galen-Kallela (born Axel Waldemar Gallén), and Zachris Topelius to name just a few, among others
All huge names in Finnish history and culture
Unless of course you’re referring only to Swedes as those from Sweden, and not including Finland Swedes in the mix
Sorry if I am misinterpreting or misunderstanding
My girlfriend is Fennoswedish and lived in Sweden for some time
She has said that the general knowledge of Finnish, and even Finland Swedish, is shockingly abysmal in Sweden
She said once that she’d even met people who heard her speaking Finland Swedish — not Finnish — who’d assumed *that* was Finnish

This comment is going to get lost but the 'Unknown Soldier' book really has me reminiscing
I'm Canadian and worked with a Finnish woman who was absolutely lovely
There's something about cultures that are polar opposites of one another that's sort of hilarious to try and work through
Anyway, whenever I meet someone from a culture I'm unfamiliar with, I always ask for a book that encapsulates the country, or a book that every citizen of that country is familiar with
Something interesting I can bring up in the future aside from the most overdone sterotypes, ya know
She recommended that I read Väinö Linna's Unknown Soldier- not only was it a fantastic read, I think it's a great representation of the Finnish spirit
The few Finns I have met since (there aren't many of you over here
) have really gotten a kick out of it when I bring it up
But seriously thank you for the lovely art, and cheers to your lovely country and people
^:DDD
This is from the comic Stand Still Stay Silent, it's a very good comic I highly reccomend
[Mr Speaker, I'd like to put a tax on all people who stand in water
Ça va, on vous aime quand même ♡
A glorious day for Europe, and therefore the world
Lets help Holland (who will take care of themselves, quietly, with no fuss) take care of North Western Europe
Looks like an UltraSound ...and
It's a BOY
Now I understand why our two nations get along so well
Like those tents in Harry Potter
Is that
fish Muhammed
They even gave him a wispy neckbeard, you love to see it
OP that username is amazing gotta say
Eliminate Russia and you've got an EU party going
England technically still in
USA sends our OKAYs
That is like saying congratulations to the USA for winning basketball at the Olympics
Hmm
now that the Finns were brought up
why do they suck at the game, relative to their Scandinavian peers
I was a 15-year-old American at the time giving football a chance
And Team USA really wrote a great story that drew me in to the sport
You know what still hurts about 2002

<3 from Canada
I really hope to visit one day
You should see the fuckers at Duomo
We have a strikingly similar one in [Toronto]
The Irish moved to Canada in large numbers, a lot of them settled what is still today known as "cabbage town" just to the east of downtown, named that because the stodgy white folks disdain for the smell of boiled cabbage
It’s mainly due to how birth rates nowadays are very low in first world countries
I guess my eye saw something
Nice to know
The bravery of these people
Something I’ll always respect
Tankies out
Reject authority
I'd show up just to see boobs, how is that a good form of protest
Albania only ever had one king because they got it right the first time
I mean, how are you supposed to top the name ["Zog"]
Tried way too hard
Now it just looks like shit
Who in the frig is upvoting this garbage
As a Canadian, This graph  is like doing a three legged race with a corpse
The real story is how well Africa is coming along
Has that been with a lot of external investment from China and the West, or is it largely domestic
And then there's the Middle East saying: "LOL, we'll just turn up our air conditioners more".
We had 40s here in Canada
And people say global warming isn’t real
It felt like 40 yesterday and will feel like 36 tomorrow, assuming I'm alive to see it
Time to move to Galicia
Central southern Canada has always had terribly hot humid summers
Now they're even hotter
It's definitely even hotter now
But even as a child I remember summers where it was 35+ for days with unbearable humidity
Cost of electricity is a huge factor
Power costs in North America run from like €0
03 to 0
15 per kWh
It's something like €0
10 - 0
50 in Europe
It's basically 10x as expensive to run an air conditioner in Germany compared to Canada
Nuclear weapons have far more to do with this than the EU
Don't want the job to be too peaceful mind you
As a Canadian I hope everybody stays safe except for the terrorists
They need to be caught and shamed in court
I know what to do
We'll saw their teeth in half horizontally
Then we'll force them to drink slushies
Maybe a tooth a day
You're correct
Too many people have died thanks to this bullshit secular fantasy that 'everyone shares our values'.
Denying an anti-enlightenment religion & *ideology* from having a place in western civilization is absolutely not a position of hatred
The world is a little brighter today
Love you Finns <3
Tolkien based one of his elvish languages on Finnish, so it's more like the Elves are speaking Finnish, rather than vice versa
Bit awkward with the other big voice in Europe, Germany, shutting all their nuclear power plants down
F R  N C E
Good
THANK YOU FRANCE
Why is Europe so afraid of nuclear energy
The best time to plant a tree is 10 years ago
The second best is today
It absolutely is all that
Unfortunately, the public perception of nuclear is all death and destruction
That's despite events like Chernobyl being the result of a lot of human error
People also get scared of radiation, for some reason
Sure, storing the waste is a problem sometimes, but the power plants don't kill anyone
Honestly, it's frustrating
Fair
I do believe, however, that we have the technology to eliminate many of the problems reactors faced in the past
We can create power plants that are smaller and more efficient in regards to nuclear waste
Though the investments needed to do better are lost to fear
I think this is a fair point
Where the waste goes is less of a problem for us in Canada, but I suppose Germany would struggle storing it without many places for the stuff to go
However, I still believe improvements in technology can allow for much more efficient reactors which don't lead to nearly as much waste
Modern designs can continuously keep using spent fuel for a long time
The waste issue isn't an impossible obstacle to overcome, and nuclear is still much more preferable to the coal taking its place
We need to give innovation a chance if it means doing good for the environment in the long term
Beautiful place
Would definitely recommend a visit
He was dead by the time the cameras were rolling
Really funny considering Poland and Lithuania were the last of Europe to be converted to Christianity
Meanwhile in Poland, the Catholic Church helped preserve Polish national identity while under occupation by the Russians and Prussians, and more recently it also played a major roll in the fall of communist one-party rule in Poland
Very different legacies

(canada invented this pizza topping)
I'm outraged
As Canadian-Asian who considers Hawaiian style pizza one of the best topping combinations to exist, I find this statement to be extremely discriminatory
I want my MP's to propose an Anti-Pineapplephobia legislation
Or I will riot
If you do no allow me to have pineapple and ham on my pizza you are a racist and a Nazi
Did ya know Hawaiian pizza was invented in Canada
The more you know
Who knew that Iceland would emerge as the Voice of Reason in this crazy world
Pineapple is fruit
You don't put fruit on pizza
War it is
Damn right
Hawaiian pizza is my favourite

Which tool was used for this ? I've seen like 2 posts using this and I'd like to overlay this as well over Canada for perspective
Hahah I know right
Brexiters are immune to Coronavirus
As are Fox News viewers
I was just permanently banned on r/worldnews for implying the entire family should be deported if the police probe finds out that they were all aware that the father was going to do this
If the young student was the one who reported it to his father, then he obviously thought it was something terrible and worthy of punishment
That doesn't necessarily imply the rest of the family knew and didn't try to stop him - but I wouldn't at all be surprised if that was the case, considering the environment this kid must be living in to report to his father that a cartoon of Mohammed was shown (gasp
) and then be ok with his father decapitating his teacher for it
I'm not sure how young this kid was, but obviously he was being raised in a violent and extremist environment, and I can only speculate what the rest of the family thinks
Regardless, this is absolutely horrific, and fucking disgusting
Man when Pete Hoekstra ran for a US Senate seat in Michigan, he posted this ad against the incumbent
I think that says quite a lot about who this racist is
I often wonder how long it will take for the rest of the world to take the United States seriously again once this freak show is over
You should come to Canada if you think that's special
Ours is the same with some sort of apology so people can saw "aw so Canadian
" thus entirely deflecting the question
Press at the White House do this and it never works :/
Basically ITT, Europeans are vastly superior to Americans
Question is, when is this not the case on r/Europe
He sat in the fire place and pretended to read documents

So gonna add it here
Yes, I was joking and referring to the infamous "I stand for nothing" Trump interview (that you linked)

Looks like fascism has returned all over europe for the first time in over 70 years
Today the EU has shown itself to be a fascistic luddite organization with no reason to exist
Amazingly this is going to affect American businesses, which everyone here relies on such as Reddit that heavily uses links to stay afloat
&#x200B;
If this were happening in the US EVERY one of you would be saying how shitty it is, how grateful you are to live in the EU as they'd never be so insane to pass such a law
Yet it looks like SOPA is dead in the water still while this has passed with extremely little resistance from European citizens
&#x200B;
"Muh freedoms" also includes keeping the internet as is, meanwhile vastly superior EU tries to reign it in while having imbeciles blindly support it at every turn
Is there a complete breakdown of votes anywhere
Is it because the NPD got a seat last time

>I want the EU to take more of the migrants from Italy, also i'd like everyone to meet me new friend Orban who doesn't want any migrants from Italy
>There's really no winning against all the mental gymnastics you guys are able to make
Mental gymnastics
It's pretty clear cut logic that Salvini's alliance goes against the goals he says he is for
Salvini wants EU quotas for migrants
The EU wants EU quotas for migrants
Orban does not want EU quotas for migrants
Salvini and Orban form an alliance
By allying with Orban, Salvini is a hypocrite going against what he claims to want
It makes it clear that all he really wants is not the EU to share the burden of migrants but instead to have an anti EU rhetoric even when they are in favour of what he asked for in the first place
If anything Salvini would have more credibility if he sided with EU on the issue since it's what he was fucking demanding like two months ago
This is like when Mitch McConnell filibustered himself in the States
Sorry to pop your bubble, but yeah that’s probably not happening
If anything, AfD is likely rising
A 13% decrease in CDU is a big stretch though
And if you’re polling only 1500 people with six options, of course you’re going to get a disproportionate result
I’m betting that green won’t rise higher than 14%, and cdu falling no more than 9
Tbh this poll shows every party except green and FDP falling
you have to wonder what the pollsters’ motive is
Probably isn’t happening for real though
This poll is the ONLY one that shows greens in the lead
This poll is likely being used solely to influence the public, and it’s obviously working

Then again, when a nation of 168 million people attacked a nation of 3
6 million people how'd they do
What's the reasoning they used to blame it on the Brits
Imagine being this guy, having a bad day and telling yourself "Today could not get any fucking worse
Then, as you're casually driving down the street, taking every precaution in the world to be a good, responsible driver, your car nosedives straight through the fucking road
You'd then proceed to immediately walk out of your car, look at the nearest crowd, and gesture towards your car as you exclaim "Really
Are you seeing this shit
If only 1/5 of Poles support the new bill, then it seems pretty daft for the politicians to be doing this
Are they just blinded by personal belief, or are they reading different

I hate seeing berries here in Canada
They're so expensive so people don't buy them much and they go bad on the shelves (moldy)
Just knock a bit off the price and you'll make up for the waste and thensome
I used to work at a supermarket and it was truly saddening the amount of product I had to throw away
Specifically anything dairy, I blame it on the consumer since they figured that most recent product sits at the back of the shelf they would go out of their way to reach said product, when there was clearly other stuff at the front that had plenty of shelf time
Eventually that’s how a lot of stuff ends up being thrown away
But people going hungry has been around for 10000 years
People throwing food away is a new concept and yes the other guy is correct: we can afford to do that now in certain places
Yeah, Redditors like to climb on their high horses and just blame corporate greed, but [here's what the aftermath of dumpster diving looks like

Hence the old joke that the two greatest successes of Austrian diplomacy were to convince the world that Mozart was Austrian and that Hitler was German
is it common for these 4:3 films to have that red curtain letterboxes
That is an interesting number to think about but "literally half" is incorrect
Using /u/gxgx55's simple example:
> Each person knows some amount of other people, let's mark the average amount of people known as K, whatever the number might be
Then that means, on average, the amount of people that are separated by 3 degrees from you will be K^3 , while 6 degrees would be K^6 . K would have to be ridiculously low for what you said to be true
If K = 44, for example, then the fraction of people within 3 degrees of separation versus 6 degrees of separation would be approximately K^3 / K^6 = K^-3 ≈ 0

Been used as part of the french immersion program in Canada for many decades
Although the Cleopatra film has its qualities:
* Monica Anna Maria Bellucci in various states of undress
By the gods that woman
* (For the french version) [It has one of the greatest improvised monologues about nothing ever put to film] by the Scribe Otis (literally translates to Autistic)
The actor beside him almost blew it because he was going bonkers trying not to laugh
Apparently the amount of improv
in that particular movie made the A&O creators go ballistic and they swore to never allow an other movie unless they had full control of its production
Ergo, It's all downhill after Cleopatra
The puns
* Asterix (*),
* [Obelix] ,
* [Panoramix]
* Cétautomatix (It's automatic -> "C'est automatique"),
* Abraracourcix (with a lot of strength, violently -> "à bras raccourcis"),
* Assurancetourix (full coverage insurance -> "Assurance tout risque"),
* Agecanonix (The official age -> "L'age canon"),
* Ordralfabétix (Alphabetical order -> "Ordre alphabétique")
Interesting choice of colours

That's a nice quote, but you definitely can live in a free country where manufacturers of sugary cereals can advertise towards children
Kids most likely aren't going to go to the grocery store and buy the cereal themselves; parents need to take responsibility for their children, including the diets of their children
That's kind of a huge aspect of freedom
Okay, great
Of course we all use words differently and they change over time
In Canada our left leaning Federal and Provincial party, The New Democratic Party, successfully voted to ban the use of the word socialism from its constitution (2011
Even though they are directly descended from the democratic socialist tradition
I understand we use the word Liberal very differently then Americans, here it means limited government and individualist, ie freedom of
market, trade, speech, religion, press, etcetera
In America it was for a time a word so left leaning as to be synonymous with communist or at least big government, a dirty word
(and it is interesting to note how many large government expansions were actualy by the GOP)
Our right-wing conservatives we used to call them Tories or even red Tories, a word that directly seems to descend from outlaw, or highwayman; is now chiefly concerned with fiscal conservatism and economic liberalism, my how things change
or stay the same
The US might look at us as socialists, increasingly I think Canadians see the USA as a Kleptocracy
Perhaps some Americans do as well
It's always a bit surprising when I realise how little some Americans know about Canada
This hurts my brain

China is really the only one that’s socialist
Venezuela is just a complete disaster
Then you have Scandinavia, Canada France and Germany
They are not socialist, we just have good social services
Meaning, the government cares about its citizens
Reminds me of a documentary I watched on YouTube the other month called *Sweden: Lessons for America* by a Swedish journalist
In it, he covers the myth that Sweden is socialist, and then immediately breaks down how it absolutely isn’t, and how it’s a free market economy in which the working and middle classes actually pay more in taxes (proportionally) than the multi-millionaire and billionaire classes
This is, of course, exactly how it works in the United States too
There's a distintio
Sanders is a full blown communist, his political history makes that pretty clear
That said, his platform during the primaries definitely weren't mostly because he's smart enough to know that americans would never stomache a leap like that and pretty sure marxist communism require socialism first anyways
I'm from the UK originally, so from my perspective things are going much better in Canada than they are back home
I do agree that Canada could be doing better in many areas, but i also think that's true of most places
Now it's time to get the ol' boys back together as the Anglosphere Union:
United Kingdom + Canada + Australia + New Zealand
Couldn't the UK just resign from the Union but become part of EFTA, like Norway and Switzerland are
Or am I missing something
To be fair, I didn't explicitly specify free movement of people and should have been more clear with what I meant, but anyway having it between the aforementioned countries and South Africa (and others) would not be a good idea
I'm always struck but the gratitude that most Dutch people still show for the liberation from the Nazis

Someone should nudge the UK and let them know it’s not the 19th century anymore
They aren’t the big boy at the negotiating table and every time one of their politicians act like the EU won’t negotiate in good faith it makes their entire country look utterly moronic
UK: “What do you mean we can’t have the benefits of the EU without contributing to the EU
If you don’t give us what we want, we’ll leave
EU: “You’ve already committed to leaving
You have no leverage

no we are not, any of those youngsters would spit on the british flag any day if it meant albania has something to win over it
Canada is still technically speaking under the crown, so yes i am an albanian subject of the queen

Never said i do not consider myself Canadian
All i said is that 99% of Albanians would spit on the country that welcomed them, if their country of origin has something to win
And this is true with every immigrants, not Albanians alone

Yes and she is the queen of both simultaneously

I remember one time I was in vilnius and I met a very stoic Swede
We were hanging out with a bunch of people all night and he never laughed or smiled
At one point late in the night the fact that Danes couldn't speak Danish came up and I remember seeing this video years before
So I brought it up and showed him, never seen such a hearty chuckle in my life

[My favourite constructed language called Occidental] was born there (the creator was a Baltic German who lived his whole life and died there too) starting with a publication called Kosmoglott that took its name from an interlinguistic society, the first in Imperial Russia, that produced a whole bunch of projects including a spinoff of [Volapük] called [Idiom Neutral] I'm not surprised at all that general literacy was also through the roof

As a Canadian I still consider America to be our closest and most reliable friend and our largest ally
1 man is not going to change that despite his best effort
Its their national sport it seems
I assume that was the amount of people who voted for Trump
I bet the vast majority of them would say they have no issues with Canada and still consider us friends and allies
There are Americans on both sides of the isle that would like to see the friendship ended just as there are Canadians of all political leanings who feel the same American our relationship with the US

I get between 1 and 5 of these calls a day, and a lot of them are spoofed to look like they come from a local number
I just don't answer my phone anymore if I don't recognize the number
Do not call lists don't really work because fraudulent telemarketers are operating outside of your jurisdictions and hiding behind SIP trunks with false telephone numbers
Despite having subscribed many times to the Canadian do not call list, during tax time I get frequent fraudulent phone calls claiming to be from the tax authority
The majority of these calls originate from India for the most part and use text-to-speech software to fake the authority of the call
Last year [there was some action on India's] part, but the calls continue nevertheless
I find this phenomenon to be rather tiresome

Even when not moving, where I live (Eastern Canada), we have more than 60° C of difference between the colder day of winter and the hottest day of summer (some years we reach 70° C of difference)
Some days the temperature can jump over 20° C in a single day (either up or down)
The same 10° C causes complaints both because it's too cold (in fall) and too hot (in spring)
Over a few weeks/months, the body adapts to a certain temperature and a too high variation will feel uncomfortable

People bitch and moan about NIMBY, but this is the ultimate reason why the feeling exist
One of those requests is from me
Oooh, do Sofia
In Canada when they started construction the Western Canadian portion of the Canadian Pacific Railway, it was cheaper and easier to get Chinese labour from Hong Kong than from Halifax
Of the 9,000 railway workers, 6,500 were Chinese Canadians
They were paid $1
00 a day and had to pay for food and gear from that salary
White workers were paid $1
50-$2
50 a day and did not have to pay for food and gear
As well as being paid less, Chinese workers were given the most dangerous tasks, such as handling the explosive nitroglycerin used to break up solid rock
Due to the harsh conditions they faced, hundreds of Chinese Canadians working on the railway died from accidents, winter cold, illness and malnutrition
In the iconic historic photograph of CPR Director Donald Alexander Smith driving the ceremonial “last spike,” when the western and eastern sections of the CPR finally met in Craigellachie, British Columbia, all of the Chinese Canadian workers were cleared from view
My great grandfather and his first born son was executed by the partisans for selling meat to an Italian soldier to feed his family of 7
While I agree with the sentiment, I don't see how such a policy could be fairly implemented
I would not trust any organization enough to allow them the power to *sterilize* someone
Any such system carries much too great of a risk of bad actors co-opting it to just begin sterilizing what they consider to be "undesirables
It is far better to leave this up to personal choice, and instead focus on removing the current access barriers we have on sex ed and birth control
No relation
But I can imagine a lot would have fled at that time
I trust the state, sure
But do I trust them to *sterilize* the population
That's one hell of a power they would be given
You claimed yourself that sterilizing autistic people and people with Down Syndrome wouldn't be moral, yet that's what the *trustworthy* state did 30 years ago
Another Finland user in this thread claimed that Finland was ranked to be the most racist country of the EU
I don't know how legitimate the claim is, but if there is any bit of legitimacy to it, I wouldn't trust the country to decide who can and can't reproduce
Take Canada for example, I don't think it has the reputation of a a particularly racist country, but the government forcibly sterilized native women up until the 70s (and approximately 100 women claim to have been forcibly sterilized since the 70s, still) because it was for **"their own good"**.
I would, to some degree, trust our *current* state to handle this, but I probably would've said the same of the US 10-15 years ago
It's too much for me to say I can trust any organization in perpetuity
And there's a large movement against such things for good reason
Putting aside whether the punishment is effective or ethical, mistakes in the criminal system are unfortunately common and to some degree inevitable - our society is in a good enough position to be able to say, "we can afford to keep such people locked up rather than risk killing any innocents
>For the same reason we **allow** teen pregnancy to be terminated, we allow this form of termination
Notice how you wrote **allow** instead of **force**. Unless you're advocating for forced abortions on teenagers, too
You say that, but the various atrocities committed and being committed across the globe, many in nations that *ought* to be past such things, proves that wrong
I thought the question was about the death penalty
For that, there's strong movements against it - hence why more and more states have followed much of the rest of the developed world in removing the death penalty
If you don't think such movements exist, I think you should be looking at yourself first here before claiming that "It only exists in your [echo] chambers
And on a different note, are we *really* comparing people with "undesirable traits" to *criminals*? That's exactly the slippery slope that I'm pointing out is problematic
>Because you focus on some random detail of my post, you missed the point
I'm discussing the "dark" morality he tries to picture
I didn't focus on a random detail of your post, I focused on a detail that, for me, invalidates your argument
Just because we allow teens to have abortions doesn't mean we should forcibly sterilize the disabled
I got your point just fine and I agree: non-autonomous people shouldn't be in charge of a less autonomous being
I disagree with you solution
I agree that I should remove the weeds of my front yard, but I won't advocate for setting my yard on fire to get rid of it
> There are many cases where people do not have the right to dispose of their body
Prisoners and psychiatric cases for example
It's always in the case of protecting a 3rd party
Jailing criminals isn't always to protect a 3rd party
It can also be a form a retribution, justice some may call it
In the best of cases, it is for rehabilitation but jail isn't really the best place for that anyway
I still think the analogy is off
You jail someone *for an action they did*. We are discussing sterilizing someone *for the way they are born*. I don't understand how you see them on equal grounds
u/80sBabyGirl already mentioned how your argument is a better push for birth control than for forced sterilization
The former is, to me, a more sensible solution
The latter is way too extreme for my taste
>You could even make a good case that having children at all is morally questionable
Indeed
Although I made the decision to have a child myself, I realise I did bring a new person in a world of limited resources
>Just like a vegetarian would be wrong to force people to stop eating meat
This is a very good analogy
Well done
Okay, there's a number of separate things here, which I will tackle independently
1) Death penalty, forced sterilization of criminals
Hence, that's why I said
> our society is in a good enough position to be able to say, "we can afford to keep such people locked up rather than risk killing any innocents
I agree; some, if not many, societies in the world aren't in such a position
That's not relevant though, since we *are*. There is no need to risk causing that degree of permanent harm to innocents
2) Comparison of "intellectually disabled people" as 'undesirables' in a similar manner to criminals
Our discussions started about "intellectually disabled people
It was mentioned that "forced sterilization of intellectually disabled people was a very common thing"
When I argued why that ought not to be a thing, you said,
> We sterilize rapist
and then
> You missed the point
You claim we should leave it up for people to decide
Well, people in jail do not decide for themselves how they dispose of their body
That is, you're *directly* comparing "intellectually disabled people" to *criminals*. This is what I have issue with; are you *seriously* arguing that "if you're fine with the government sterilizing rapists (which I'm not, for reasons mentioned above), then you ought to be fine with the government sterilizing what they deem 'intellectually disabled' people"?
To put it a more obvious way, "let's sterilize what we've arbitrarily deemed 'undesirables' based off who they are rather than what they've done" - sound familiar
Seems like we hit Godwin's law now
I mean

Bit late to party, but I had a nightmare/dream recently that got me interested in the Swiss system, by my understanding is nobody can do it for you, they assist you with obtaining drugs and applying an IV if that's the way, but administering is completely on you
Correct me if I'm wrong
In Belgium, does one do it themselves or have it done for them
In my Canada we're currently deliberating how to write the law about it after our Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional to not allow assisted dying
The only condition I'd think in my current mind I'd want to kill myself is if I became quadraplegic and could not use my arms at all, being assisted by a person and/or breathing into a tube to move my wheelchair and type on a screen
That I'm sure I don't want
But a quadriplegic can't physically kill themselves, so in Belgium (and Swiss, if I'm wrong on my understanding) be able to have someone do it for them or would they be trapped in a wheelchair
Also, in Canada it appears we are headed to terminally ill and chronic never ending pain, excluding mental issues
So if someone is otherwise physically healthy and not in pain, but can't live a life because paralyzed from neck down, Canada appears they wouldn't allow it, with the way the legislation appears it's going
That's incredibly depressing and probably the most likely scenario
I remember doing research on that conflict in English class in grade 12
We read a short story and then did a research assessment on Ireland during the war
The story was about a sharpshooter scouting on some rooftops, and ends up killing another soldier, who he later finds out was his brother
A very well written, yet sad story
They did your boy dirty he was a fucking beast
If I remember correctly, I think it was after the 2nd partition, there was a civil war, Russia invaded, then the poles started WINNING against the Russians, then the government said “Fuck it” and forced the Poles to surrender, which lead to the 3rd partition

The European  Union commissioners  have announced  that agreement  has
been reached to adopt English  as the preferred language for  European
communications, rather than German,  which was the other  possibility
As  part  of  the  negotiations,  the British government conceded that
English spelling  had some  room for  improvement and  has accepted  a
five-year phased plan for what will be known as EuroEnglish (Euro  for
short)
In  the  first  year,  "s"  will  be  used  instead  of  the soft "c".
Sertainly, sivil servants will resieve this news with joy
Also,  the
hard  "c"  will  be  replaced  with  "k".  Not only will this klear up
konfusion, but typewriters kan have one less letter
There will be growing publik  enthusiasm in the sekond year,  when the
troublesome "ph" will  be replaced by  "f". This will  make words like
"fotograf" 20 per sent shorter
In  the  third  year,  publik  akseptanse  of  the new spelling kan be
expekted  to  reach  the  stage  where  more  komplikated  changes are
possible
Governments  will enkorage  the removal  of double  letters,
which have  always ben  a deterent  to akurate  speling
Also,  al wil
agre  that  the  horible  mes  of  silent  "e"s  in  the  languag   is
disgrasful, and they would go
By the fourth year, peopl wil  be reseptiv to steps such as  replasing
"th" by z" and "w" by " v".
During  ze  fifz  year,  ze  unesesary  "o"  kan  be  dropd from vords

When I lived in Holland I could hear who learned English primarily in school (British accent) vs TV / movies (American accent)
Interestingly, I had friends then from Dutch Caribbean islands that had a very clear "Caribbean" accent while speaking their native Dutch
That is they used the same sounds I would hear from English speaking Caribbean countries
Can you pronounce the Dutch town "[Scheveningen]
I'm an English speaking Canadian who lived in Holland for a couple years and Scheveningen was a word that I couldn't pronounce
Apparently it was a secret word to tell German spies from Dutch nationals in WW2 because Germans can't pronounce it either
Why is Android more popular in Europe than North America
Back when I was in high school, basically everyone had iphones
It was really only the techky kids who were more interested in specs that had androids
The exception was the international kids (mostly from Germany, Italy and Spain)
A good chunk of them had android phones (maybe like 50%)
And I don't think that it was really because of price because most of these kids came from pretty well off families as it costs like 30k to do an exchange
But digging into the numbers ([source] it seems like it seems to be the case that android is more popular in Europe than NA
NA is about 55% to 45%, whereas Europe is about 70 to 30
Sure there are some countries that aren't doing too well in Europe but even in the rich European countries like Germany and France, there are a lot more androids than iphones
The only countries I saw with more iphones than androids were the UK and Norway (though there could be others though as I didn't check every country)
So is there any particular reason for these differences
Gay to have an iPhone
Wow, I’ve seen it all now
but do windows computers and androids even connect to each other
I've never heard of anything that connects them
So even if you had a macbook and a samsung galaxy (or vice versa), wouldn't you basically be getting the same experience as two non-apple devices
We don’t just use iMessage you know
a lot of people use Facebook messenger
In fact, from my experience, everyone I talk to is through FB and not iMessage, even though all my friends have Apple
The way I see it is that with iPhones, you know what your getting
A pretty decent phone that is basically guaranteed to work for 95% of the things you need to do
Whereas androids can be more hit and miss
Yeah you get what you pay for and you can't really compare a $200 android to an iphone or a $1000 android
But at the same time, apps are generally designed with iphones in mind and are optimized better for them and its hard to make a well-optimized app for the hundreds of different androids
I think huawei phones are sold in the US its just he 5g infrastructure that has been banned
Also I think that when americans do buy androids they tend to buy from the well established brands like samsung and not so much the new chinese brands like huawei and xaomi
Maybe its because there is more anti-china rhetoric and korean brands are preferred but idk
wait so are you guys still using windows phones
Its not cheaper
Its usually slightly more expensive (like $15 to $50) compared to buying from the apple store
>Wait, so iPhone is more popular in the US fhan Samsung Galaxy Note, for example
Oh yeah 100%.  Well I cant really speak for the US (but would assume that its similar)
I dont think most people would be able to differentiate a note from any other android
Well maybe they could back when the note first came out because samsung marketed like crazy and it was way bigger than any other phone and had a stylus, but nowadays, i cant remember the last time ive seen a note
(the last time I can think of was a demo in a store when the note 2 came out)
Why would you need three different SIM cards tho
>i personaly only know one phone manufacturer that makes IOS devices
unless you are referring to the various chinese companies that actually build the iphones, yeah apple is the only manufacturer of ios devices
>Now this is the perspective from someone in their final year of high school
(Everyone is  between the ages 18-20)
Kinda off topic but is it normal to have a lot of 20 year olds still in high school
Or is it just people taking a victory lap and people who may have failed a few classes
Or do you guys have the first year of what would be college for us complete in high school
Here it would be incredibly rare for a 20 year old to still be in high school and if they were, there are usually special courses that adults would take (like night courses)
For reference, i'm only 19 and about to start my 3rd year of university in september
Personally I have the opposite experience
>No headphone jack, because
I think that theres a little bit more to it than that
The trend is going more towards wireless headphones so eventually, wired headphones wont be necessary for most people
Removing the headphone jack also frees up space that can be used for other hardware
And removing the jack doesn't mean that you can't use wired headphones, you just need to have an adapter (which comes in the box)
And many android manufacturers are following apple in doing so too
maybe its not so much of a status symbol but more of an expectation and if you have an android its sort of looked down on
Well it’s like any other status symbol really
Why would someone spend $300 on a Gucci belt when you can get a non-brand name belt that could look just as good and of similar or better quality for a fraction of a price
Ohh I thought you meant three sims on one phone
They had their original SE which was basically an iphone 5s on the outside
Well yeah, but the same could be said about any other status symbol
It’s not so much (at least here) having an iPhone says “I’m rich” but not having one sort of says “I’m poor”
It’s kinda weird
Kinda off topic but do you know why some phones come with multiple SIM card slots
Never really made sense to me

Less time spent talking at the table European-style by the customers means the same table can sit more groups of customers, which means more profit for the restaurant
It's about the throughput and efficiency
Plus more customers means more tips for the waiters, which is essential to their income

I’d be ashamed that he didn’t get the same amount of a basic human right as me
It would be like if I got police protection through my employer, but I watched my neighbour get mugged and couldn’t do anything
Or if I got my firefighters through my employer, but I watched my neighbour’s house burns down
I would just feel so helpless
Almost half my salary, because I am reasonably well paid, goes to taxes

Here in canada, the further sough you go I find the more bottled or purified fridge water you find
The justification for it
“We don’t want to drink water that runoff from mins and stuff”. Where might the majority of mines in the province be you ask
About 600-900km straight north with no direct link to their water source
I’ve never understood drinking only bottled water

Apparently not
I stg ordering food was a NIGHTMARE
I’m native Québécois Francophone and I can tell you that I had to make some efforts to understand what they were saying
They both have a really old school/regional French
actually, it’s technically not an english accent- apparently the québec french accent is the closest accent to 16th/17th century french, since the colony was so isolated from the rest of the world haha
but yeah, on top of that québec french is like 10% normal words 90% slang
The same shit in Québec, Canada Sometimes it could be changed to "working at a Belle Province" (a Québec fast food restaurant)

On 9 December 1917 two ships collided in Halifax harbour and one of those ships had explosives onboard

During the Revolution, there was a major counter-revolution orchestrated by the royalists in Vendée. The newly formed Republic then sent an expedition to this region
But they didn't just take back control, they **obliterated** the entire region, especially with the infamous "Colonnes Infernales" (aka the Infernal columns)
What happened to the land there is unimaginable, as this wasn't just like a Viking-like raid (pillage and burn), this was a methodical devastation of a "threat to the Republic".
Edit :
Those divisions were called "Infernal columns" for a good reason
The Republicans soldiers marched in tight columns led by drummers which had (allegedly) lit their drums on fire (or at least the drumsticks) and they had one mission : Burn all the shit they encountered to the ground
Un des mes ancêtres, Jean-Jacques Goullin, est un des responsables majeurs de ces noyades
As I said in French in one of my other comments, one of my ancestors, Jean-Jacques Goullin, was the right arm of the dude responsible of all the massacres in the city of Nantes
They would celebrate something called "marriage républicain" (républicain wedding) : You strip naked a noble man and woman, tie them together and throw them in the sea while yelling "Vive les mariés !" meaning "Long live the married !"
We like to take credit for that, since Americans always crap on us
C'est quoi ton adresse ? Juste pour savoir
I’m in Canada so I don’t know my schnitzel the way an Austrian would
My first impression is that the flavours of a sauce make it very tempting, but adding a liquid might destroy the texture of schnitzel, which is crisp perfection already and should not be tampered with
If I did this I think the sauce would have to be served separately and I could only dip the cut edge of the meat into it
Mineral water is free
Interesting
I really need to visit
We already do that in the winter in Canada
The sunlight that rises just after I get to work or 1 hour into my work makes zero difference to me
I know this is askeurope but I think a fantastic setting would be a major city in Russia during the transition from communist ussr to the Russian federation
A story about lost glory and adapting to the new times in a crime underworld would be a great setting for a story fitting a GTA game, especially since GTA 4 took heavy inspiration from Russian cinema
Ah, yelling distance, the only good distance
“A single city on the west coast” -Vancouver, Canada
Canada's this weird in between, when I visit the States I'm shocked by the portion sizes, when I go to Europe I'm disappointed by them
Guess that means we're just right
I mean, I would not expect service in English in a foreign country's hospital
The fastest way to get me to shut up is to ask me for a "best kept secret".
I expect to see this list featured in a Buzzfeed Travel article soon
Basque language and culture is incredibly interesting to me, and I feel like a lot of people (especially North Americans) wouldn't even know what "Basque" is
Also trying to learn Basque as a native English speaker is so incredibly difficult
Very cool and unique language though
France sure is present in the news here in Québec even though we're an ocean apart, but it's mostly when something big is happening
Because in the end, french politics have absolutely no influence over what's happening here
We get a lot more news from the RoC and the US on that front
Canadian here
Can’t help but feel like this question was written for us
Chiming in as a non-european
Canadians definitely find themselves in a similar position
Most of our media is american, sometimes to the point where people will know more about what's happening down south than about what's happening in their own provinces
We have a law that limits american ads on cable tv
It was instituted because previously american ads were flooding our television broadcasts
This was done to help out Canadian businesses
It always becomes a hot button issue around the super bowl because of how good those ads are
I personally believe Canada is just always in the awkward position of hanging on to the British realm while being groomed by america
We definitely get the same effect here aswell
I rarely hear about anything internationally
All it is currently is election horse shit
I hardly know whats happening in my own country and even then I have to look it up online
I specifically follow some foreign news stations that have english sections to get away from it all, like NHK Japan on twitter
Twitters also bad with it "Trending Page" so I set that to a language I I don't read
Not sure if this is sarcasm so I’ll do my best
Ninety percent of Canadians live within 100 miles (160km) of the US border
95+% of Canadian media, movies, TV, music and content comes out of the US
More than 50% of our news is about the US and if that more than half of the news we watch is from US stations like CNN or similar
While this question was pointed at Europeans I fully expect Canada is one of the single most influenced by a bigger neighbours news affected countries in the world
Sorry
Interestingly I thought I did see a US flag but then when I looked again it was gone
Just did the same thing here
Odd Reddit/IPhone glitch I suppose
I’m Canadian and speak French quite well
I was at a hostel in Australia, and two French guys were sitting there going around the room talking about each of the girls in French
This was after we had all chatted about where we were from and there were no other people from France
They were saying things like “oh yeah, she’s hot
eh, she’s not the prettiest” etc
When they got around to me and said they thought I was good looking I said “oh merci, les gars”, and they were thoroughly embarrassed that I had been listening in the whole time
I guess they forgot other people speak French too
I play scopa with my Nonna here in Canada all the time
She gets super flustered when I win lol
yep thats about how my scale goes, except i dont even gove going outside a second thought until -40
As a Canadian, I second this .
Canadian here, I know it sounds weird, but Chirstmas decorations (namely Christmas lights) help make winter a lot more tolerable
Yeah there’s less sunlight, but that just means more opportunities to see the pretty Christmas lights at night
Aside from that, remembering to stay social with friends and loved ones, and finding hobbies that can be done indoors from the comfort of a comfortable couch/bed under a cozy blanket helps make things more bearable
Also picking up a winter sport to stay active, but I’m not sure how much snow Aus gets so I’m not sure how possible that last tip is
In Canada we also have smoked tuna (on the Pacific Coast), which is absolutely amazing
Just give it a few years
>  ethnic compositions
What
Sorry for ignorance but I though Serbs/Croats/Bosnians were all the same ethnicity and the major differences were religious
I bet, but objectively speaking it's people sharing the same language and culture, same geographic region, and are of similar roots
So I was reading this thread and super surprised to see you all counting the cost of LEGO sets in the *hundreds* of Euros range
But then I checked online here and saw that sets in Canada also go for up to $400 Canadian, which completely blew my mind
But at least the millennium falcon one I see a lot of you mentioning is only $180
As collector’s editions that makes so much more sense
I thought people were quoting the price for toys and was so confused XP
If he’s in Berlin then why not speak German
Wow, I’m getting a Caribbean vibe from their accents
Ah alright
In Canada we had a very similar situation as the Aussies
Aboriginal children kidnapped from their homes and sent to residential schools with really shitty conditions
They were taught “how to act white” and would basically be doomed to live on the streets the rest of their lives, suffer immense emotional trauma and would never be able to contact their family ever again
The last of these residential schools closed in 1989 I believe
Usually the children were taken if the native family lived too close to an area that was starting to industrialize
That would be the Holocaust
#1 is David Haselhoff's singing career, of course
Where and when should you go
I was planning a Greece trip (postponing until next year though)
Always looking for recommendations
I’m learning espagnol
Given that ~300 million people speak it, it might be helpful in the future
Is Petain really hated
I mean, he was like 90 when he collaborated with the Germans
What about his service in WW1
I mean, a lot of countries just gave up as quickly to avoid more costly engagements
It can be argued he saved lives by surrendering sooner
Is the Danish King as hated
Well I mean, scratching the mass executions of POWs and his killing of the Basques, I'd say he was a pretty nice guy
Yeah I removed Genocide from my post
It was just plain old killing of nationalists and suppressing the use of their language
Dutch be like: ace the g or loose your knee
Can confirm
Boyfriend is Hungarian, has been speaking it his whole life, went to a Hungarian school in Canada and still has an accent
I have no hope for myself
As a Canadian, and business owner I think we need to readopt the 60 hour work week only through more effort do we gain anything
As a Canadian I would like to thank Denmark for always leaving schnapps when they visit our Hans Island
Like most chocolates, they used to be even better before the multinational corporations fucked with them to save money
Thanks for sending us beautiful tulips every year
The Canadian Tulip Festival is a wonderful tradition
Completely non-biased reporting, just what I expect from the Danes
I also have to say thanks for having great pastries, and a great public transport system
Made it really easy to get my family (my wife and 2 children) around when I was there on vacation 2 years go
Canada isn't really known for its food products outside of Canada which is shame as we have decent food quality and some interesting local foods
I think the problem is being so near the USA we don't really send things out to the rest of the world besides minerals and oil
If you ever come to Canada I recommend skipping Toronto and heading out west to the Mountains as it is great scenery change compared to Denmark
Warning not so good public transport, so a car rental is a must
I’m from Canada and I have experience speaking with & understanding metropolitan French and Swiss French
I’ve never met someone (IRL) from Belgium or Luxembourg so I don’t know the differences are there
I live in Quebec (although I’m Franco-ontarien, it is very similar), and I can pretty much understand everything in France French, Belgium, and Swiss
There might be some phrases I haven’t heard but all in all it is easy to understand
I’d say though, for Quebec, there are some joual things that I sometimes can’t understand if the accent is thick enough from Northern Québec but I rarely run into that
Canadian here, US news is 50% of our news
10% is world news and the rest is Canada specific
Not that anyone asked the Canadians ;)
At home (HK) its China, In Canada, it can be said the USA is a rival
Canada is almost constantly compared to the US in almost every regard, but I’ve often heard Canada being described as “European America”. Also the entirety of Northern Europe is our rival during international winter sports events, but it’s pretty light hearted as long as we don’t lose to Russia
Btw Vegas isn’t by a beach
It’s in the middle of the desert about an 8 hour drive inland from la
Yeah I don’t know why but the cathedral is ALWAYS undergoing renovation when I visit
Seriously
I’ve been there twice and it’s always the same
Budapest surprisingly has some very nice old buildings like their architecture
Italian Cities like Florence are also beautiful architecture wise
Meanwhile so many “Modern” Cities I couldn’t care for
Soulless sky scrapers and weird “Modern Architecture” which looks no better than Communist Concrete Cubes, litter the landscape and create a weird feeling, devoid of Culture
England isn’t much better hun
But of course, let’s just focus on the negatives
Ahh ok i got confused by your wording
Morocco is also an incredible destination
The food alone is worth the trip in my opinion
I hope you realize that it’s not as hot as you make it seem
I’m from Canada and I used to live there
40 degrees may sound like a lot, but after a week, you’ll be acclimated and it’ll feel normal
And yeah, I used to go to Jumeirah (the beach) on foot
It’s not that bad
Also, there’s AC **everywhere**. Literally
Is the vegetable you refer to [rapeseed
There's a town in Saskatchewan that produces a lot of rapeseed (Canola) and honey, and for 60 years used the slogan ["Land of Rape and Honey"]
They finally caved to pressure a few years ago and dropped it, but not before it inspired the name of [this 1988 album by Ministry
I like it here in Canada, although I do wish to move to Europe
I find the politics here too much for me, and if I ever get a good job, ill be sire to move away
If I'm not mistaken, Portugal is one of the safest countries on Earth
Great job guys
I appreciate the David Mitchell reference
My parents left Romania for Canada
They really wanted that "American dream" and felt that they couldn't get that in Romania
To some extent they got it with children, a dog, vacationing, etc
I guess they just really loved North American culture and media
As well, the organization of the country
They have much more faith that police, doctors, and other social services will take care of and be there for them when they need it
However, there is a chance that they may move back to Romania after retiring as their Canadian pensions will serve them very well overseas :)
There's a video on YouTube I think from the TV show Fifth Gear where they attempt to take a Niva across Britain entirely on off road tracks
They didn't have footage for some of it because the lightweight Niva could go where the Defender camera car couldn't.
>  Then I took my shoes off (which **none of them did**)
Savage barbarians
I used to think this was a tv show trope but its crazy that some people actually do this
As a neighbour to the US of A, I feel you
Some American's think Canadians live in Igloos, or have polar bears in their backyard
I don't think they learn much about what's outside the US
Kind seems like a bubble
I grew up in Canada
I remember being totally unphased when grandma emerged from the wolf's belly
You're so right that the only time it struck me is now, as a parent to young kids
I'm a canadian who speaks french, and i find it fairly easy to read Portuguese, italian, and spanish
I do agree with you
I visited Barcelona last year and I read signs in Catalan and understood about 70% of it
Unless it's my Canadian flag
That was the year we came 6th at the World Juniors

I'm still not over it
It's not used in China anymore
They still have some traditional measurement words, but they use metres to describe house size
>the US doesn’t actually use the Imperial system
This is really interesting to me
I am Canadian, here we refer to picked cucumbers as simply "pickles". I just assumed that that was a worldwide thing but it appears not
No I think you're right, it's just a quirk of Canada and the US according to wikipedia
We need a Pret a Manger in Canada
Not fast food really but super handy
Edit: But not with the shitty US menu
The England menu is perfect
I love Max Burger
When I was in Sweden last my wife and kids loved it
The halloumi burger is wonderful
I love all the dips for the fries though
I’ve thought this is likely for a few years
Overcrowded cities are losing their economic advantages and there is less and less motivation to live in cramped conditions when there is space in the countryside
I could be typing this post from anywhere, the heart of Tokyo or Toronto or Tromsø. The internet means I can shop from anywhere and I can sell my own products or services from anywhere
People used to have to move to the cities for any choice in any of those things, and every smaller, spacious town in the countryside has become much more competitive in the last 15 years
The exodus of people fleeing downtown office towers to work from home because of covid and physical distancing just proves how easily it can change
Pretty sure it’s a reference to a steel dome
If Ataturk or someone like him were still leading
I always love that scene for "THE GREEKS INVENTED GAYNESS"
And if we’re to answer strictly from Québec’s point of view, it’s, without any doubt, France
Quebec most famous musicians always try to go to France to hit a bigger market, some famous TV shows are shared and adapted both ways and until recently, it was even cheaper for a Français to attend a Québec university than it was for someone from Ontario
EDIT: After re-reading your point about the “mother/father-son” relationship, Québec-France relationship might be somewhere in between
Even in informal discussions, both countries refer to the other one as “nos cousins”.
But really, what is poverty in Luxembourg compared to other countries
I imagine not as bad as others if the below the poverty line is 3
3k euros (I believe maybe around 4
5k in Canada (!)), You could live damn well off that salary, but I understand prices are astronomically higher
Thanks for the insight
I never realized s country like Luxembourg has these issues with poverty
That's insane that a 7k salary is necessary for a decent life which would equate to maybe 9-10k in Canada where you would live very comfortably
Hard to imagine
Never knew Knut but I love him
I hope heaven is real and he is in it
Wow, those dogs are adorable
I’d like to thank France and Britain for giving me my country
I’d also like to thank the Netherlands and Ireland for giving me my grandparents
As a Canadian who has had a craving for the stroopwafel I had in Haarlem years ago I will use this advice with the packaged stuff I find here
Thank you
From my experience travelling in Europe and seeing the comments here, it seems to be the standard in many european countries
It's not the case in Canada (at least my part of the country), I've always had to "manually" lock the door from the inside or the outside, but I do it by pure muscle memory and I don't even think about it
But that's another biscuit
In archaeology, Leiden is considered pretty highly prestigious
The faculty is in the top 10 worldwide (QS subject ranking), it's also one of the oldest archaeology faculties
Not saying that they lack anything of course, but I have no interest in visiting England, the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, Sweden or Norway
Like it's mostly that I don't see what I can get there that I can't get closer or cheaper other places in Europe or North America
unless a southern grannie is saying it, then maybe it's not sarcastic
Haha
My husband is from there
I love listening to the stories and visiting there

From Brahms I'd recommend his Violin Concerto, any of his symphonies (though #3 is my favourite) and his Double Concerto
He wrote a lot of fun shorter pieces as well, Variations on a Theme of Haydn is one of my favourites of those
Thank you for the price descriptions of food

Not European but still a native English speaker
I don’t think it’s weird or negative in any way, but one thing that’s always oddly bothered me is how native English speakers never celebrate English as a language
You always hear other Europeans (and especially here in Canada, the Quebecers) celebrating their language, but you never hear us celebrating English
Sure, our language may be slightly less cool since so many people around the world speak it which takes away from it being unique, but the fact it’s so universal is a reason to celebrate it
We can pretty much go to any country, and not have to worry about language barriers, which I really appreciate
It makes me conflicted
On one hand, I’m so grateful
It feels like the world adjusts to English speakers, as evidenced by so many programs being translated into English or English being a language in use during an important event
Also, sue me but the best media (songs, tv, movies, books, Reddit) are all in English
On the other hand I’m jealous
English seems like such an easy language to learn because of sheer exposure one from any country can have to it
My cousin from Romania is taught English in school and perfected it from watching Minecraft videos on YouTube and gaming with other 12 yr old boys from around the world
I’m trying to learn Romanian and it is so difficult
I would rather learn a difficult language first, then learn English later in life because it is so easy to attain fluency in
Have you found any yet who do speak Norwegian
Dark is very good
We’ve re-watched the first two seasons for the entertainment value and the continual discoveries of “Ohhhhhh
I’m sure THAT’S the one in Episode 7
Go back
” The more you watch the more you piece together, and simple moments feel like “easter eggs” once you know they’re there
Season 3 feels like wading through a swamp
It feels like by then you need a chart to keep up or to confirm for yourself that the narrative is still somehow coherent
Also the first two seasons are mostly about abstract mystery and wonder, but in 3 they start trotting out religious allusion in detail and mysticism instead of mystery, and that’s disappointing
I wanted to shout at the tv: “But you were telling an original story
Now this old crap again
Why
That said, wade through the swamp
The ending is fine, and it seems like as the ship goes adrift, it blows back on course eventually, well enough
*Obligatory non-European warning, but I really wanted to share-
If ever you come to Canada (specifically Québec), you’ve got to try non-alcoholic bubbly spruce beer

The whole "people came to get grampa one night and we never saw him again" must be a weird thing to brag about

Not so much Europe, but my family is from Nicaragua, and they say "en el culo del diablo", which means in the devil's ass
I guess Dutch is convincing Norwegians of his Tahiti plan too
Really, snails as food is a global phenomenon
Not necessarily land snails, but if any country has a coastline (and it's not religiously prohibited) chances are there will be a dish with some kind of water snail (ex
abalone/ormers, limpets, periwinkles, turban shells, conch, whelks, etc
Thats not unique to you guys
Us Canadians use a mix too
* When buying weed, if its a little, you use grams, if its a lot you use ounces
* Construction materials are in imperial
* Long distances use KMs
* Height and weight are in imperial
* Pool and cooking temperatures are imperial but the weather is metric
* We cook using imperial but for everything else we use metric for volume
Theres tons more, i just don't feel like writing them
Scottish are even more “British” than the English as their ancestors and culture has been on Britain for far longer than the Anglo Saxon culture
Did they happen to be speaking to Europeans or non-north Americans
If they were, they were probably just confirming to the way that the other people were measuring
Yeah that’s probably why
“Runners” is probably the most common word for that sort of shoe in Canadian English as well
“Wanker” is too useful a word for me to ignore and it’s now passed into Canadian speech
“Bell-end” however, even though there are times when that’s probably the right word, would sound stupid and fake coming from me
That was a final Jeopardy a year ago right after James Holzhauer’s run

Well since I'm Canadian I'll put a spin on the question, English is number one with french in second place, Punjabi is the third most common with about 430,000 native speakers
Caps lock is only for yelling at people in online matches
Now that you mention it, it's weird to have all members of these European countries speaking English
Weird in an interesting way, not a bad one
Using "of" like in "would of", instead of "would have", is a pet peeve but wtvr
Yup, you are quite correct, but that is the only thing I can really observe that is out of place when this sub speaks English
Other than that, it seems quite fine
Real forests are nice
Well, next time Germany goes crazy give Turkey a call to liberate you
Not a British thing I would say, it's very common in Canada as well
Maybe that's partially due to our shared heritage though

Kinda related: would you guys know Canadian provinces
Like if I mentioned one of the bigger ones like Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia or Alberta, would you guys know
Or what about the bigger cities
I’ve also heard people complain the opposite way too
Like if you assume that everyone around the world knows your small state, it makes you sound arrogant and makes it sound like you’re the center of the universe

As a Canadian, I'm super jealous of everyone's relative proximity to each other in the EU
Land travel sucks here
(Actually, air travel does too—prices are insane
I live in Winnipeg—a city of around 750,000 people
To get to anywhere else that's interesting you can either drive ~25 hours to the East (Toronto) or six hours or so to the West (Regina, which barely counts as interesting)
Fourteen or so hours West gets you to Edmonton or Calgary, which both have around a million people
About 20 hours West gets you to Vancouver
Ah, or you can drive eight hours North to see polar bears on Hudson's Bay
The idea of passing through several countries in just a few hours is bananas to me
Is there no push to adopt Gaelic in commerce

This is the best advice
So many people get hung up on grammar and pronunciation that they forget to learn vocabulary
You can make grammatical mistakes and still be understood
If you don’t have the vocabulary, you can’t communicate a point across
Plus it’s easier to remember cases with examples than memorizing the conjugation
As someone learning Slovene: in my experience I spoke better when I didn’t care about grammatical rules and just focused on communication
The grammar will come more naturally if you learn through examples
And it’s less discouraging
july 1st tends to have a lot of fireworks here too
So how exactly does the EU's freedom of movement and of residence work
Sorry in advance if this is such a basic question
I'm a curious Canadian who wants to know how the freedom of movement and residence works for an EU citzen, especially for those individuals who are utilizing it to live and work in another country
I can read all the facts about it from governement websites, but I want to know about the personal experiences you can't get from a government webpage
I just discovered through a cousin who did it, that I can obtain EU citizenship through ancestry and now I'm seriously considering adjusting my current plan to pursue a longtime dream of mine to live and work in Europe
EDIT: Thanks for all the responses
Looks like I'm incredibly lucky to have the ability to obtain an EU passport
I have lots of research to do but I'm really not fan of the (lack of) worklife balance among other things here in Canada and I'm thinking the Netherlands fits a lot of my life goals

My niche is geotechnical with regard to dams, so its a dream for me to work on the Dutch coastal engineering projects
In France there is 3 major movements :
-Scouts of France (SF)
-"Unitary" scouts of France (USF)
-European scouts (ES)
I have spent 8 years with the ES and am enjoying my last year
Here are some characteristics of the different movements :
SF :
-No hierarchy ; Separated in age groups ; Their uniform is composed of shorts, a "group scarf" and a colourful shirt (it can be red, blue, green etc
-They do more caritative work than the other movements, but have less real "scouting" time and shorter camps
Thus, the 2 other movements consider them like wimps
- They are also "mixed". In a same group you'll have boys and girls doing their shit together
ES :
-A "troupe" is composed of "patrols" (between 3 and 6), and each patrol has 6 to 9 scouts
Among those patrols, their is a hierarchy based on age
-The uniform is a brown shirt, a group scarf, blue shirts with a leather belt, mountain shoes or rangers, and a blue Beret
- Boys and girls are separated in different "troupes", but sometimes they meet to do some stuff together
USF :
-They are a mix between the SF and ES
They are very similar to the ES, with the European thing left aside
-The uniform is also very similar
One of the main difference is the color of the sweater
For the ES, it is a dark navy blue, and for the USF it's light brown
These are the main characteristics of each movement
It isn't complete, so if any of you have questions concerning the activities, regulations or politics among those groups, feel free to ask me anything
I remember Medvescak played a hockey game in the Pula Arena, that was so cool
That’s very cool
I want to experience that someday

French is my second language and many Canadian cities have obligatory cringeworthy mottos
Winnipeg is “Gateway to the West”. Calgary is “Heart of the New West”. Edmonton is “City of Champions”.
Or, as I called it one day when describing the city was assigned to me in French class, *Ville des champignons*. City of Mushrooms
I wanted *Ville des Champions*.
If my parents were to get me a romanian passport would I still be eligible for those cheap "600-800€" prices

I once saw someone transliterate Irish into Cyrillic and it was the first time I could ever figure out how Irish is supposed to be pronounced (I've tried studying Irish on my own, but no formal language learning environment)
My first language is English

Is a fags pole like the cigarettes version of those things [people keep posting on Pinterest to give away their old books] Ha
In Canada we don’t have fLag poles on people’s homes either
It looks natural for us to see our flag on a public building or a town square or something
Maybe because a flag is supposed to unite a community, it belongs somewhere where people assemble more than behind someone’s hedge
In my neighbourhood I could probably walk 2 km in any direction and only see maybe one
Depressing af
It's a story of a group of heroine addicts who were never really able to get clean
I kinda forget, were they clean by the end of the movie
Not to mention the scene where the baby was found dead
I dunno, the UK is so grim and rustic and gray, it's just depressing in general
Well I didn't say it was bad, just depressing and sad
Definitely left a mark on me though
I still enjoyed it, I guess just not my type of movie
Hard to watch, addicts throwing their lives away like that
Ah yes
I remember now
No, is it any good
In Québec there are additional curse words that don’t exist (in the same way) as France
Those curse words are all related to the Roman Catholic Church, and there are even grammatical rules here as to how to use them and how to use different combinations of them
And each combination corresponds to how angry that person is using them
I found this example on Wikipedia (I’m not Quebecois enough to master les sacres lol)
« **Mon tabarnak j'vais te décâlisser la yeule, câlice or mon tabarnak, m'a tu t'l'a décâlisser ta gran' yeule**: Décâlisser means "to fuck something up"; yeule comes from the derived noun gueule, which refers to an animal's throat or maw, but is used in joual to mean the human mouth or face
The whole sentence can be summarized as "I'm gonna beat your fucking face in, you motherfucker". »
There’s a sentence that puts the in a specific order, and if you mix up the order than people will judge lol
I can never remember the right order, so I won’t butcher *les sacres* here lol
You could add a gender-specifier if you wanted, e.g. girl/boy friend (kız/erkek arkadaş), sister/brother (kız/erkek kardeş)
Some more trivia: Turkish also doesn't differentiate gender on professions, e.g. aktor is actor/actress, garson (from the French word) is waiter/waitress etc
On the flip side, there are specific words for some relatives like older sister (abla), older brother (abi), and your paternal vs maternal aunts/uncles/grandparents
Fish is a Germanic word (coming from Proto-Germanic *fiskaz*)
However, if you're a person such that the only animals in your diet will be fish, you're not a fishatarian, you're a pescatarian (from the Italian word for fish, *pesce*, which in turns comes from Latin *piscis*)
However, digging deep into history, both *fish* and *pesce* ultimately come from the same Proto-Indo-European word, anyway (*peysk*)
I feel like I'm a spiritual Swede haha I've always answered questions this way and was confused as a kid as to why people thought I was "brief" and "not talkative"
I tried to find language selection there but could not

That's what we say in Québec
Week-end feels a bit cringy to me
Where are you from
Week-end is common slang that everyone uses from time to time
Québec City
I do hear people using week-end instead of fin de semaine from time to time, but not that much
The World Superpower
I speak French and Spanish, both to an upper-intermediate to advanced level
I've studied a bit of Portuguese
Italian: 65%
Portuguese: 90%
Romanian: 50%

I'm not even European, and I feel like a part of our culture has been lost
Notre Dame belongs to all of Western Civilization
The world, really
Only because they don't know Quebecois swear words :)

On the second one you mentioned, I remember hearing in a video that the government put in place after angry moustache man went to away, but before the end of the war, they began planning for rebuilding the country's infrastructure, cities, and armed forces
As if they were going to remain in power with their current/former political system
The Netherlands actually has a higher English proficiency than Canada
Fun fact
It happens in Canada too, it's only really when they have something for you though
I did not know this was a North American thing

I was on it for hours reading about the uprising, listening & reading interviews
Absolutely amazing place I plan on visiting
Canada legalized in Oct 2018
Our cities do not smell on every corner like it does in Amsterdam (I’ve visited) although you will get occasional whiffs
We are not able to smoke yet in public places and do not have smoke coffee shops like Amsterdam does though so that could be a difference
Although, I think if I have to endure smelling a cigarette every time I leave a building cannabis smokers should be able to smoke wherever tobacco smokers can
The city I live in (Edmonton) allowed public consumption when it was legalized here
I've only really gotten a whiff or two when walking in most areas
Only in the nightlife areas of the city can you noticeably smell it
And I’m of the complete opposite opinion
Tobacco smoke makes me nauseous, and while pregnant it made me throw up whenever I smelt it
I learned my family was going to Florida on a vacation when I was 6
I looked on the globe we had, trying to find where we were, and where Florida was, but I couldn’t read well
I knew that we lived near a body of water (Lake Ontario), but didn’t know which one
I then made the assumption that we lived in Florida, and that Florida was Argentina
I had a similar experience but with sports
Like some races where only allowed to play certain sports
I think it formed from seeing basketball, football, and hockey
The idea died after I asked friends at school about it
Those cities are not in Canada
Yet
This reminds me of a Hoi4 mod that places Poland in the Atlantic Ocean
I thought something similar
That there was, in the last 100 years: WW1, WW2, WW3, and Afghanistan
The only reason I thought Afghanistan was such a big deal is because we didn’t have a war in a long time
Au Québec, on dit "les milléniaux"!
Doesn't seem particularly worse than Westminster systems tbh
I get that the point of the thread was how the systems exist \*as written\* - and British MPs can no-confidence their PM while French MPs can't with the President - but \*in reality\* when the PM has a solid majority in parliament s/he can pretty much do anything
Like yes, but also the Fourth Republic [was truly catastrophic] (like Italy's First Republic, but many times less stable) and pendulum naturally swung away
I agree that it's time to swing it back a bit though
Obviously not European, but I know people from Toronto who went to Montreal
I didn’t even know staying within Canada was an option
Québécois here, we have the Office de la langue française, (OQLF) which is an actual authority on the Français here in Québec
The *Académie*, like *Le Robert*, *Le Larousse* are seens as tools to help us determine the proper usage of the language
I would say that it is engraved in the Quebecois DNA to protect their language against anglicisms due to us being surrounded by so much english
The OQLF has even been blamed for its overzealous attitude on enforcing the rules set by the *Charte de la langue française* (see Pastagate)
Agreed to everything that’s been said in your comment, OQLF is a great institution and an absolute requirement to allow Quebec to thrive as a « Société distincte ».
Pastagate was the result of an unfortunate mistake of one public servant which has been quick corrected
I refered to it to highlight the kind of authority that OQLF has, (which, I consider, is a good thing)
I think it’s a pretty unique and awesome institution for us Québécois who majorly care about the survival of French within our territory
I did too
Thought you guys spoke “Belgish” or just “Flemish” until a few years ago
Lol calling people ignorant while calling the Anglo-sphere "anglo-saxon"
This is a new level of absurdity
> All of even most Belgians are keen on ripping the country apart
this isn't true
was kidding
All I know is that yall don't have a government half the time because Wallonie and Vlaanderen are at each others' throats it seems :/
hahaha, yes, I am the FLQ and I will bomb innocent civilians until Québec gets their independence
Vive le Québec Libre !
So someone in Kalingrad would speak the same dialect as someone in  Vladivostok
True, makes sense lol
When does the dialect become another language
Is Catalan a different language than Spanish or just a dialect
Similarly would Sicilian be different than Tuscan Italian
This is entertaining

What’s the most foreign license plates you’ve ever seen in Europe
For me, once I was in Mostar, Bosnia and a bright pink ~2009 Chrysler 300 drove past with plates from Washington state

Was a diplomat or UN leader visiting
Maybe it could have been part of their detail

I watched a video about the history of Luxembourg (I know it’s not micro, but it is small), and it was really fascinating
yes, but the real question is would they try again
So I have Serbian and French editions of HP (in addition to the original English) and I find it amusing to compare the three
But here's an interest excerpt from *Translating Children's Literature* by Gillian Lathey that discusses their differences (for my fellow nerds):
&#x200B;
>Translations of the Harry Potter books indicate, however, that the trend towards the acceptance of spoken language varieties in children's book is by no means universal
Throughout the series, Hagrid speaks a non-standard English that is not characteristic of any particular locality \[but that is probably\] meant to indicate that Hagrid has working-class origins and certainly that he is of lower social status than the highly educated Dumbledore
>An international gathering of Harry Potter translators \[...\] revealed a range of responses to the representation of Hagrid's vernacular
Serbian translator Vesna Stamenkovic Roganovic \[...\] was quite prepared to use a regional dialect but rejected a solution that would make Hagrid seem to be 'a Serbian peasant rather than an English giant'. So the translators created an innovative '*Hagrid pidgin'.*
>\[...\] On examining a number of other translations it appears that a lingering reluctance to reproduce a colloquial language results; for example, in the French translation, Hagrid uses standard grammar and pronounciation
\[...\] Anne-Lise Feral attributes the French translator's strategy here \[...\] to 'the importance of grammar in the school curriculum in France where pupils spend a minimum of eight years learning the complex mechanisms of their own language'. (Lathey 79-80)
Thats a silly argument
France was already gearing up so they were committed by that point
Yes Germany brought UK into the war, but we can just as easily say "Belgium turned into a world war because had Belgium given Germans permission to ride through, UK wouldnt have gotten involved".
Which is a way stronger argument than saying the war started because Germany attacked Belgium

Almost everyone does it here, but buses here have two exits (one at the front and one in the middle of the bus) so if someone leaves out the middle exit then they don’t for obvious reasons
I love the Finnish accent, when my two Finnish friends speak to each other in Finnish it sounds like birds chirping ️
Also one of them said she barely passed English classes in high school and she speaks and writes fluently, so you’re doing something right (wrong
) with your english education
Heh when I visited the Netherlands I was shocked at both the level of English spoken by EVERYONE, and at how awful the accent sounded
Of course I learned to say “spreekt u engels
” and EVERYONE looked at me like I was crazy — like bro, of course I speak english
The kid stocking shelves in the supermarket, the immigrant who owns the kebab shop, it’s incredible how good the english is in the Netherlands
Not European but Quebec
Canadian here, I think our anthem is pretty good, although there has been a point made that it’s non gender inclusive
There’s also a Canadian rapper who did an “Oh Canada

It’s awesome, although also very sexist
Would you be willing to trade it for edelweiss
That’s kinda what a lot of non-Austrians thought it was anyway
I’ve heard people say “for this motive” instead of “that’s why”

“Pumpkins are in season in October
For this motive, many people make pumpkin pie around thanksgiving”
Instead of:
“Pumpkins are in season in October, that’s why many people

What are your tips for learning Romanian
/u/MetricConversionBot
> Aix-la-Chapelle
This is a french influence
> Wien
How is this pronounced
Because Vienna is cool sounding
In italian the "gn" sound is simply pronounced under specific grammatical circumstances (of which elude me), kind of how in french a "h" followed by an "o" is silent but nothing to denote that
C$1 - an apple or a small bag of chips/crisps
C$10 - a small bottle of maple syrup
C$100 - an adult transit pass in a mostly inadequate system, or filling the car with gas about twice, thus making transit look even less favourable by comparison
How do Europeans have all these free potatoes

Same price for milk in Canada
Cries in Canadian
Even with the discounted prices of the collapsing airline sector, it would be C$ 588 (£340 / €390) at the cheap end to fly across the country
Commuter trains only exist in one corner of Canada from Toronto to Quebec City really, and though it would be a dream to take the train across the country that is mostly a premium tourist service that would cost easily 3 or 4 times that
It is one of the most vivid flavours from my childhood, like vanilla or cinnamon or chocolate
Essential for pancakes or waffles, maybe just 50mL or so, drizzled on top
I also like it in savoury foods, with garlic, pepper, ginger, lemon, and soy sauce, to glaze a filet of salmon
It’s one of my favourite flavours and I would regret not having it at least once a month
Usually it is only horrifying when made into something your grandmother might prepare for a church tea, called “maple fudge
”  It is basically a small brick of diabetes, so sweet that I can barely tolerate even one just to be polite
And also fake “maple-flavoured” syrup is available, usually at bargain breakfast restaurants where it is enjoyed by people who are happy to unleash a tidal wave of any sticky syrupy sweet thing on their plate full of carbs
Of course there is no comparison
Seconded that that is truly horrific dubbing

In Québec, we Say "le saint empire romain germanique" so yeah, in french we use "German"
Not Europe, but Québec has the « Office québécois de la langue française » which is a political office that attempts to regulate and promote the usage of the French language in the borders of Québec
Isn’t this two separate issues though
Yes I understand centralised prescriptive language authorities vs decentralised descriptivist anything-goes
But that’s separate from the question of whether people decide they prefer to speak their own language or not
Like Québec has the *Office québécois de la langue française* and people joke about the “Language Police” when some restaurant gets fined for having their menu only in English or Cantonese or something
But it’s not all-powerful, and the reason French Canadians don’t say “le week-end” or “un e-mail” is because they prefer *fin de semaine* and *courriel*.  They don’t feel like it’s silly or a put-on, it’s that they know the language can handle some new concept so why wouldn’t it grow to do so
Not a word, but J and G confused the HELL out of me
In French, J is “zhee” while G is “zhé”. In English, J is “jay” and G is “jee”. I’m pretty sure that’s the one last thing i’m lacking before I can say I’m fully fluent in English
This is confusing in English too when you grow up and hear about the concept for the first time
Have to see it in writing to believe it
I’m an anglophone and now that you point out tomb, womb, and bomb, I can’t un-see it
They all rhyme in my head right now too
If I understood, an anglophone would probably want to spell it “Yata”?
Same problem in reverse for anglos learning German

Or of the trois glorieuses, or the Franco-Prussian war
Haha oddly enough this is definitely what I think of too
Makes sense since “CANZUK nations” as they’re commonly called all share the most in common, as predominantly white, Christian, English speaking countries
Africa and the Caribbean just aren’t what I think of when I hear “Commonwealth”
Very accurate
While most Canadians hate to admit it, we are very American
English Canada used to be very culturally British until around the 60s when our entire country was rebranded, but that’s a whole other thing
Lots of people (including me) believe we should be closer to our British (and French) roots
... wtf
You want war, suffering and poverty
Changed the flag from [this] to the current maple leaf flag, national anthem changed from The Maple Leaf Forever which very very strongly celebrated Canada’s British heritage (google the lyrics if you’d like) to O Canada which I personally find a bit mundane, national day’s name changed from Dominion Day to Canada Day
Much more, but these are the three main things
It was all in an effort to create a more uniquely “Canadian” identity instead of a British one, but now if you ask Canadians what our culture is, they’ll just say some bullshit like multiculturalism
The monarchy for example hardly has any presence in our country anymore, yet it used to be widely celebrated
Shame in my opinion
Haha considering they just hardly ended up staying in the country in 1995 with 49
4% supporting independence, maybe some of it was worth it

Here in Québec, it depends on the language
If you’re an anglophone speaking French with an accent than it’s likely you’ll receive ridicule
If you’re a francophone speaking English with an accent than people don’t even bat an eye at it
According to some of my allophone friends, if you speak French with an accent than you’ll usually get the same reaction to anglophones; but if you speak English with that accent, Anglos are more likely to be kind
Edit: I’ll add that Canadian anglophones are more likely to receive a negative attitude whilst speaking French with an accent than American anglophones
From what I know people from Herzegovina stretch their vowels a bit more, especially people from Mostar
I also feel like there exists a "seljak" accent

Lol, as a Canadian, I’m also a little resentful of the way Word Processors and apps all tell me my spelling is wrong because it’s not spelled the American way
Lol, absolutely; I always correct the “auto-correct”
Because Canadian English is actually somewhere in between the two
We have more spelling that is the same as British than we do American, but some words (usually involving the choice between 1 or 2 L’s or between an S or a Z) may be more similar to American spelling
I did a google search and found an example chart:
Well if it helps, I find the female German accent incredibly sexy /shrug
We aren't your protectorate thank you very much

I don't think he did either but it's still kind of offensive regardless
That is a much better way to phrase it, thanks
Truly disgusting, I'm sorry to hear that
What about French
What do you think of forced Irish implementation similar to laws like we have in Quebec for French
In Quebec all signage must be in french, immigrants must attend french school, government workers need to know french, all services must be able to offer french ect
You can have other languages too but it must always be in addition to french
As others mentioned, Quebecois is like the difference between the French in Paris and in the south of france or with the French in Belgium or Switzerland
Maybe a tiny bit larger but yeah no where near a different language
Similar to how Aussie English differs than Canadian English for example
> revive Slovak
I don't think that counts the same way Irish does though as Slovak is extremely similar to other south Slavic languages, yes
I don't speak any but I imagine it as the difference between British English vs American English
Compared to that, Irish is more of it's own thing
> There are quite significant difference between Czech and Slovak (its closest neighbour language)
Interesting
I did not know, thank you

In 1917 a Norwegian cargo ship and a French ship (which carried a shit ton of explosives) collided with each other in Halifax harbour (Atlantic coast of Canada area) the French ship exploded and killed 2000 people, injured 9000 and was the largest explosion in history up until the nuclear bombs dropped in WW2
Everything within a half mile was completely obliterated, the explosion also caused a tsunami, 31 000 people were left homeless
The Norwegian ship ended up being on the wrong side of the harbour, but it was ruled that the French ship should’ve been more careful with its cargo and the French ship could’ve avoided the collision
Not surprisingly there was a really strong anti-french sentiment in Atlantic Canada after the incident, in the end, it was deemed that they were both at fault

When I was a kid, the morning and afternoon care program for working parents was run by three thick Welsh speakers that just moved to Canada to setup shop
When we all entered the first grade they had to have 30 or so kids get speech therapy to remove the thick welsh accent we picked up
What made it even funnier is that we had tons of inner-city straight from Vietnam kids speaking broken English with heavy Welsh accents for the first year in Edmonton which is about as far from both places as you could get
I am almost 40 now and I still remember how awesome and kind those 3 care workers were
Is that okay on that wall about John Lennon
I do have a country yes, thanks for asking
Ikea is mostly viewed from the highway
Holy shit
It's frightening to read through the comments
Germans really don't see any issue with having 40 000 foreign soldiers on their soil
Et plus généralement un obstacle majeur pour une Europe indépendante géo-politiquement (à moins que ce soit un voeu pieux)
it's probably more frightening to have a token army try to hold off the Russians, to them
Who knows
People would be trading Russian foreign soldiers for American ones, were it not for the USA hauling ass for the last seventy years
Oh I can understand given your unique history
I'm more familiar with the French point of view, being a French-speaker, and it's crazy how on the two nations are different on this topic
And to correct a statement made in the comments, there is no US military presence in France
De Gaulle kicked them out at the time
Don't you think it also continuously shapes your relationship with the US
I mean the French, the German and the Brits could easily due the job against Russia
I don't think the EU needs protection from the US militarily speaking
Absolument
Mais à voir comment les Allemands ne font pas de cas des 40 000 GI sur leur territoire, j'ai bien peur que vous soyez bien mal barrés...
Perhaps, but there really needs to be a strong speedbump against the Russians which simply doesn't exist in many countries, Germany included
More so with Trump in power
I'm curious, is there an active movement to kick the US military out or most people just don't care enough for it
You're right, it probably has to do with East Germany/Eastern Europe and the fear of a comeback of the Russians
You never have enough military power when you're frightened
Seems quite different in Western Europe
As early as in 1966, De Gaulle said "*Qui croit encore à la menace d'une invasion soviétique* ?" But France does have the nuclear weapon
Un grand merci pour la mise en contexte très intéressante
La géopolitique européenne n'est pas simple compte tenu de l'histoire récente extrêmement différente pour chaque pays d'Europe et en particulier l'Allemagne et les pays de l'Est lorsqu'on parle de Russie
Par curiosité, c'est Sarkozy qui proposait une négociation avec la Russie en 2017
(et juste pour être sûr, je dis tout ça en étant bien conscient que le Canada est encore beaucoup plus mal barré que l'Europe, géographie et relation de pouvoir déséquilibrée oblige)
I see
And you think most Germans know that other European countries (like France for instance) showed them the door at some point
Canada checking in, we have two big polish grocery chains here that compete
Yes there are lots in my city, and the surrounding area
I live in a Ukrainian neighbourhood so there's a combination of Eastern European food available, and Polish food products are available literally everywhere in my neighbourhood
We have large Eastern European import superstores, but we also have small delis, fruit markets, and sections in the "regular" stores that sell Polish food
(I didn't grow up speaking Polish, but I am half Polish myself)
In Toronto/Greater Toronto Area, we have a Polish/Eastern European grocery store
(I think it's Polish but they sell stuff from all over Eastern Europe, with an emphasis on Polish products) You can get everything from paczki, to Polish spices, drinks etc
I like paczki, as my family is Slovene, and it's like a sweeter version of our donuts (krofi)
Of course, I like all the fruit juice you can get, it's fresher and not as artificial as the juice found in Canada
And there's these fudge chocolates that my SO loves, krowki
But I'm not a huge fan of fudge so I have a bias
There's also a hot food table that sells a really good potato salad, I'm guessing it's Polish style, looks like it from a google search
And of course, Tyskie
There is usually some stuff in the foreign foods aisle
Nah
in Toronto, the country's largest and most multicultural city, there are a few Polish delicatessens, but no Polish grocers that I'm aware of
Most non-ethnic delis and butchers will have a few varieties of kielbasa, but apart from that, really the only Polish food you'll find are pierogies in grocery stores (though of course Montreal-style bagels are loved across the country
TIL that bagels originated in Poland
) Our value brand, No Name, sells a 1kg bag of pierogies for $5, pretty unbeatable calorie:dollar ratio for when you're broke
In Canada, there is a Polish deli I sometimes go to to get this little balls of pork
They’re covered in some breading(?) and they’re on skewers
I forget the name of them but they’re always fun to eat
Where I live has a lot of European Areas, theres an Armenian Centre, A Polish Park, a Armenian Church, a Ukrainian Centre, a Greek Centre, a lot of foreign Restaurants, and probably some more that I don’t know about
Same

How old were the students
Hmm, well that's close enough to adulthood that it's a little sad
At least in Canada, if an anglophone is suddenly pretending to be Hungarian in the middle of an English sentence, it can seem pretentious or even disrespectful
Since we’re a bilingual country we see this a lot between English and French
It would sound completely demented for an anglophone to say “This summer I’m taking a holiday to *Paireee*”. Nah, you’re going to Parissss
Don’t start imitating someone else’s accent in the middle of an English sentence
So here it would sound totally natural for:
* a francophone Canadian to say “Montréal” with a French accent,
* ...probably even if they were speaking English
* As an anglophone it would sound totally natural for me to say “Vancouver” with an English accent,
* ...probably even if I’m speaking French
But it would sound like a pompous affectation if I as an anglophone were speaking English and randomly saying the one single word “Montréal” with a sudden surprise French accent
Similarly it can sound very jarring to hear a francophone speaking French and squawk out “Van COO Ver” in English for no reason
It breaks the rhythm of each language
That said, what’s different here is that “Budapesht” could be an English word, it sounds totally normal with regular English sounds
But it seems like when we took this word into the language, we took the spelling instead of the pronunciation, so Budapesssst it is
Arabic, Mandarin, Spanish
I already know english, french, and basic italian
Arabic because its cool and the script is badass (only second to Georgian); Mandarin for obvious reasons, and Spanish so I can speak fluently to my wife's family
Is Azerbaijan asian or european to you
Australia being a continent makes sense if you consider India a continent I suppose
Why is it "definitely not Asian"? To be clear Im talking from a geographic approach and not culturally
Turkey is, in my opinion, both European and Asian (geographically but also culturally)
Also, Im curious how you classify the Arabian peninsula or even a country like Syria if they are not Asian
You ain't seen nothing yet
Yeah we kinda just throw "ing" at the end of things and boom now it's a verb
I kind of love how "*noun* + *ing*" works in English, even when the resulting words sound odd
Want to make some nonsense verbs
Well, let's go nonsensing
Not a verb
Well, guess what
It is now
I remember learning a bit of French during school and grammar was by far the hardest part, as for English pronunciation it's just kinda a mess
Sorry if this doesn't make sense but how does not having articles work
Like if I say something like "I was walking down the street and I saw a yellow bus with an antenna on it" would that become "I was walking down street and saw yellow bus with antenna"
(after writing that out that's kinda how we speak when we do eastern European impersonations)
Well, we sort of have three genders, like German (male, female, neuter)
He = masculine
She = feminine
It = neuter
It's just that the neuter class has grown so large and absorbed everything except for the "natural gendered" objects
As for adjectives, they're mostly non-gendered
The one gendered adjective that I can think of off the top of my head is blond / blonde
A blond man / A blonde woman
Though some fail to make this distinction in writing
It's not a truly genderless language, like you would see with Finnish pronouns or Turkish pronouns
Englishing verbs is fun, ain't it

That’s what I hate so many old songs are now reunited by nazism I love such hits as die watch am rein,the old imperial anthem and so many more
You could follow our lead we have GSTQ as the royal anthem and O Canada as the national anthem
What about *Le temps des cerises*?
Soon all the world will sing O Canada as their capitals burn
To start with, it's a bit weird for English Canadians to have adopted the O Canada
It's an anthem that praises the Canadien (read Québécois) "race" and catholicism
>Sous l'œil de Dieu, près du fleuve géant,Le Canadien grandit en espérant
Il est né d'une race fière,Béni fut son berceau
Le ciel a marqué sa carrièreDans ce monde nouveau
Toujours guidé par sa lumière,Il gardera l'honneur de son drapeau,Il gardera l'honneur de son drapeau
Et voilà. Concis et magnifiquement exprimé.

Apfelschorle is the light of my life
I've tried to make it in Canada so many times with different brands of apple juice and carbonated water and it's always a disappointment
First that comes to mind for me is the Berliner Schloss
Is that even legal, to do that at 13
15 is pretty much a safe balance between not child labour, and still instilling a good work ethic into malleable minds
Also, who do your parents know, to have been able to get that job so seemingly easily (I mean, it was for three days, but that's still perplexing)
I didn’t hear about it in Canada until this post
“Don’t be such a tent-visitor” is a fantastic saying
The other difficulty is that most anglophones probably don’t think of any meaning to the word “nightmare” beyond “bad dream
The “night” part is obvious but most English speakers probably wouldn’t even think of a female horse, they’d just think “that’s what the word is” with no particular connections
And a mare as a mythological character is probably lost from the everyday language except a few linguistic hobbyists
Fascinating to learn though
"To purr" translates to "ronronner", so the french one ends up being a bit cliché, it's *Ron Ron*.

In Canada we have the standard North American plug
But for electric stoves and electric dryers we have a different high voltage plug
Since Europe has higher voltage to start with, do you have a different plug for those high draw appliances
Now that's a serious looking plug lol
Thanks for the answer
Interestingly clothes washers have the normal plug, that's enough to run the motor to turn the barrel
It's the heat needed for the dryer and stove that draws so much
It doesn't have to do with grounding or how secure it is
Its just that the standard plug doesn't give enough electricity for electric stoves or dryers
Does the standard euro plug give enough for those
Ah that looks more in line with what our stove plugs look like
What is the plural of a rice ball then
Yes they are
We always refer to them as arancini because really who ever just eats one
Woah
The ones here are much smaller, maybe 5 cm in diameter
You always get a couple in an order
I want to see these huge arancini
Edit: I think that the ones I’m talking about are Calabrese style
THAT IS THEM
I’ve been calling them the wrong name forever
Everyone here (and there’s a lot of Italians in Toronto) will just call them all arancini - for simplicity perhaps
Regardless it’s incorrect and I love learning new stuff like this
Thank you
More complexity
Here’s my conclusion: the Italian-Canadians have merged the size of a supplì and the ingredients of arancini into some sort of delicious food stuff
I am going to do some research and find out if there are indeed Sicilian arancini/e here and I will report back

Many of Canada’s provinces are just physical descriptions of a large body of water in the area but translated into the language of whatever native tribe was living there
Quebec: Algonquin word for “narrow passage/strait” which refers to the Fleuve du Saint Laurent
(A super important and massive river in Quebec and Ontario)
Ontario: Variations of the Iroquois word for “sparkling beautiful water” referring to The Great Lakes
Manitoba: Cree for “narrows of the great spirit” referring to how Lake Manitoba is very narrow at its centre but very wide at its ends
Saskatchewan: Cree for “fast moving river” named after the Saskatchewan river
Yukon: unknown native word for, you guessed it, river
All other provinces are just named after something British/European
Except Northwest Territories (pretty explicitly named)

Yes; I think Canada might be a good example of what you’re describing
Our Northernmost territory, Nunavut predominantly speaks an Inuit language called Inuktitut; Quebec speaks a Quebecois inflected French; New Brunswick and Labrador have large (maybe majority
) regions of Acadian French; the Western and central provinces are predominantly English speaking; and each of these linguistic areas has its own unique culture and foods
We are however tied together by generally similar values, though culturally they do play out differently
And of course we do have our internal strife, but on the whole, I would say most people (perhaps not the most vocal people) are happy with a unified Canada
Provinces and territories elect our own leaders (premiers) but we also elect our federal leader, and what is provincially governed and what is federally governed are divided
That is not to say that premiers and the prime ministers office don’t ever disagree, but that’s why we get to elect new ones every 4 years ;)
Additionally, while the population of Europe is certainly far greater than that of Canada, in terms of land mass, we are almost equal
That means the geographical separation that affects transportation and cultural uniqueness would be similar in both Canada and the EU

The terrible Scottish accent is a thing, I thought it was just me but other Europeans agree
Seriously, what are they saying
That’s not English
I can understand the Irish and Welsh just fine
Funny would be how many of you shit on Russia and the Russian people agree and laugh with you
Weird would be how many words there are to name the region that consists of Norway, Sweden, Finland, Iceland, Denmark, and the Faroe Islands
Many have referred to this as Scandinavia, many say Finnic-Scandinavia or something, and different words are used to include or exclude one or more countries
Worst would be someone saying Americans have no right to vote in Europe but Europeans having the right to vote in America, or some such nonsense
But jellied eel ...
The idea doesn't sound too appetizing
Okay wow, I meant the first comment as a joke
I guess that didn't transfer
Sorry
In Canada, the most universally loved hero is easily Terry Fox, he was an amputee who lost his leg to cancer, but still ran a marathon every single day across Canada (Halifax to Vancouver, Atlantic coast to Pacific coast) in an attempt to raise money for cancer research
His “Marathon of Hope” originally he raised 24
1 million dollars before he died halfway across Canada, but he still continued to inspire people and over 700 million dollars has been donated to cancer research in his name
Canada here:
Elementary school grades are taught way too structured
Kids need to move around, not sit in desks for 8 hours like university students
Also, kids learn through different learning styles and this is not addressed
History is atrocious through out our education system
We are taught in great (too much) detail about Canadian history and minimally about the rest of world history
We are a very young country and it would benefit students to know what went on in the rest of the world
Language system is terrible
We are a bilingual country and unless you live in Quebec you learn the bare minimum of French right up to graduation
Religion should not be a part of the education system at all, it’s 2019
Separate Catholic schools should not get additional funding that the public system doesn’t have access too
This is what church and Sunday school is for
Additionally in smaller centres, some communities only have access to a separate school so children are forced to learn this shit even if they and the parents don’t agree
Basics on daily life, politics, health, and finances is grazed over or ignored completely
While there is argument this used to be what parents taught children, it’s not happening and new generations are at a loss when they graduate and move out on their own
We called this Red Ass or Red Wall
Whoa
Reads almost exactly like French
Si je te parle en valencien, tu peux entendre ce que je te dis
Si Jo te parle en valenciá tu pots entendre el que te estic dient
Ha that whole website is /r/atetheonion because obviously there is not any dispute at all
Unless it’s a typo and they meant some other island in dispute somewhere maybe with another country
Everyone knows that Hans Island is Canadian, not Danish
In fact, it’s the heartland of our culture and heritage, the place where we first set out in search of maple syrup, the place where poutine was first imagined, and where we first argued about whether it was Hans Island or Île Hans
It’s like how the Icelandic look to Þingvellir as their ancient seat of government, or the Japanese look to Kyoto, we Canadians look to Hans Island
The Danes know this
Hans Island, Danish
That would be like us pretending Møn Island or Funen is Canadian
“Oh sure it’s just a little east of Newfoundland, but it’s ours, I tell ya
” Anyway that link was good for a laugh but clearly it has more to do with satire than geography
Or here is an idea you leave the UK AND JOIN CANADA act now and we will throw in 4 free bottles of maple syrup
Looks like Parcheesi
Which is interesting supposed to be one of the oldest games ever developed
We brag a lot about our country
Maybe it’s just because Canada is often compared to the US, or the fact that Canada usually ranks pretty high on the “best X in the world” but we will often “subtly” bring it up when talking to foreigners or Americans
Also we are passive aggressive and don’t like confrontation (unless it’s in the hockey rink) which often leads to bottled up emotions
Could be worse -- Serbs are malcontents with a superiority complex
The continued strength of the current government in Russia is a product of the "resource curse", I think in general general moving past the absurd reliance on natural resources would be beneficial to everybody not an Oligarch
It may finally break the state monopoly on capitalism that has been running Russia for quite a long time
I've never seen a European not storing their eggs in a fridge
But I know they're generally sold at room temperature, in supermarkets

Ok, petit pain has zero indication of actual chocolate
That’s crazy talk

Pain au chocolat passe encore mais LA Nutella
Well people normally have 2-4 slices of pizza anyway, so in this case you just have one
There can’t be too much of everything, since everything together makes it proportionate
I had it last year
It was fun to have but to be honest I don’t think id have it again
Tasted like cheese in sauce

Nice try
To be fair, to North Americans unfamiliar with eastern European culture its very difficult to distinguish any Slavs
I know about 10 Bulgarian words and that’s the extent of any Slavic language I’m familiar with
I could not tell the difference between Polish vs Russian vs Albanian for the life of me
Therefore it all defaults to Russian because chances are its Russian due to population disparities
The revolutions of 1848
Le Havre est vraiment a mentionner
Wait, really
For some weird reason, the majority of the french people I'm friend with are Breton and I've never noticed anything significantly different with their accent
Don't forget the potential declinations of c'est / s'est which can also include c'est / s'est / ces / ses / sait
I've never heard of comme même instead of quand même in Canada though
We're definitely no better as a group though haha
I've noticed that plurals such as les chevaux / les chevals are often messed up here
Also: *c'est* (it is) vs
*ses* (his/her, plural) vs
*ces* (these/those) vs
*sait* (he/she knows)
I actually like Frisian
I want to learn it
i think most people here are counting greece as part of the balkans
Really
My memories of Vienna in 2013 were that you buy a pass at a metro station, then they operate on the trust system, so you just get on and off trams, metros and busses without showing anything
Canada just voted to ban single use plastics in 2021
Also, researchers in British Columbia found a way to convert any blood into O- blood (the universal donor)
>Panathinaikos vs
Olympiacos
Nope, none of that peace and friendship stuff
Yeah but like, what about those Winter War temperatures where bodies froze instantly when they died
yeah but it's not like it (freezing winters) never existed
I know, it's quite saddening
Here too, there were much more bountiful snow-storms in my mom's day and age
Yeah but they would have to tag some stuff on
I've also heard of a YouTuber make fun of "Slough" (he said it like Sl- Ow, idk the spelling
Lemme guess, you're gonna put Huylo
To be fair, there are like, a trillion Jean Charles in France + history (hyperbolic but still, it would be hard to differentiate)
I haven't looked through the comments, so this should be fun
Here's what's off the top of my head:
\- I heard that BENELUX predates the European Union;
\- Belgium, Luxemburg, Netherlands make up the group;
\- French and Dutch would be the most common languages with Luxembourgish (is that the right word
) coming in at third;
&#x200B;
I don't know much about it to be honest
Can't wait to read the thread now
Edit: So I interpreted the question as the mini-political bloc and not the three countries individually lol
Another fun fact: between 1945 and ~1955, Canada had the third largest navy behind the US and UK
Why can't Germany be "Big Austria"?
We prefer Cold America

I fucking love this thread so much
You're gay and a cat
I’ve heard that leaders of BeNeLux countries can fill in for each other in certain functions
Is that true
Sorry, I have a few more questions
Is there a written agreement for this
And to what extend can the Prime Minister of Belgium or Luxembourg represent you on the international stage (can they speak on your behalf
Negotiate/sign agreements on your behalf ? )
Are there some specific examples of this happening
Why do you trust other countries’ leaders to have your best interest in mind
Why not send a second-in-command from your own country if the prime minister is not available
Is that how Belgium functions without a government for so long
They do not need their own PM because they can just borrow yours when needed ;)
The last question is a joke, but I do want to know how Belgium functions without a government for so long
Thank you for your detailed answer
Spain: Getting fresh fruit from the Arab market in Grenada and then going hiking in the mountains for a day
The fruit tasted like candy
Finding a stream that fed the Alhambra and cooling ourselves off in it
France: Couchsurfing with a retired law professor and getting a private personalized tour - he asked me earlier why I was coming to Paris and I replied "Cheese and baguettes". I usually cook for my hosts so one evening he bought like 10 different cheeses and we sat and talked about life over some great bottles of red wine
Belgium: Meeting an old friend in Brussels and walking from downtown to the Atomium whilst drinking beers
Really was a random occurrence and shows you how small the world can be
Netherlands: Couchsurfing hosts took me on a personal boat party that was pretty rad
Got to see a lot of Amsterdam that way
I loved Haarlem too
Hungary: Absolutely hanging out on the bridge in Budapest and drinking with new friends
Poland: Getting involved with a pierogi festival and then also randomly having a local decide to give me a 5 hour tour - also had the best hot chocolate of my life
Czechia: it's gotta be when some couchsurfers and local friends that all got together to do a picnic in Prague - imagine a group of 10 all teaching each other songs from their childhood and/or drinking songs
Ended with a couple of them dancing around in a fountain
Germany: I got to Dresden when there was a super heat wave happening (I believe it was around 35-40 C) and as it turned out the father of my couchsurfing host had died two days prior
We shared this amazing bond as we talked about life and death, we discussed romance as he had dealt with a major breakup a year prior and as we explored his city he began giving me personal anecdotes
We are still in contact to this day and it remains one of the most sincere and genuine human interactions I have ever had
Serbia: Stayed with a family who was super awesome
The daughter invited me to stay with them
The mom was like an Italian mother who constantly wanted to feed me
The dad was a gruff man who kept on giving me Rakia as a drink to have with breakfast
There was a lot of adventures such as a random Dutch pancake party that literally 100s of people came out to and the fisherman festival that a giant thunderstorm made us run for the castle
Bulgaria: had an awesome interaction with a host in Sofia that also brought me over to Plovdiv for the museum festival they do
Met a bunch of folks that were part of the festival and had an amazing insider scoop for most of it
Met the person who apparently graffiti'd a large statue and turned it into a superhero
Spain: wandering around Barcelona as a teenager
Switzerland: strolling in the parks along the lake in Zurich
UK: Racing across London on a boris bike at 2AM and manage to catch my train to Luton
France: Hiking through the Calanques national park in Marseille and Cassis
Italy: The lunar landscapes of Cane Malu in Bosa, Sardinia
Malta: Valetta was pretty cool
Bulgaria: Pub crawl in Sofia
Ukraine: Exploring Kiev at night
Poland: Walking along the baltic sea in Sopot
Norway: Driving around the Lofoten Islands and hiking around Kvalvika Beach
Sweden: Skiing in Riksgränsen
Germany: Delicious kebab in Berlin
I arrived in Kiev at 7PM and couldn't resign myself to stop exploring until 2AM, because not only is it a gorgeous city, but it's so lively
Here are some pics from my evening in Kiev:
I take the ambience of a new city, and immediately after, I gtfo and move to the next haha
Except for the first item, all my list above was in the same [crazy 3 week trip] ;)
Is New Caledonia a department or a territory
I've heard they don't have the same level of autonomy
Never seen a stray dog or cat in my city or the cities I have been to
I adopted my dog in Germany 2 years ago, he was in his pregnant mom's belly who was rescued from Romania (what a mouthful
Many of the shelters I visited in Germany often had dogs from Romania and spoke about the bad kill shelters there
Do you know if these shelters are part of the government's measures you mentioned
Québec french is probably one of the closest things french has to a dialect, but even then, while vocabulary and pronunciation are a bit different, the written form is the exact same thing as european french
Germany, although there are many in every country, there are an abundance of job opportunitys in Germany
Also, since I'm soon entering university, studying in Germany, much like Scotland is basically free
Finnish sounds like chickens clucking
That's a bloody shame, because the first song is real groovy

En quelle langue est cette émission
On dirait du français bâtard
On a la "chance" de les côtoyer de près au Canada, alors avec le temps j'ai réussi à décoder quelques mots, mais c'est pas toujours facile
Et encore à l'écrit ça passe, mais si tu entendais le bruit qu'ils font lorsqu'ils essaient de s'exprimer
C'est un bien triste spectacle
Oooooh, on insulte ma mère et après on se trouve des excuses enh
Non mais j'hallucine
Ah, merci mon ami
C'est agréable d'enfin rencontrer des gens sympas sur reddit
Mais c'est très bien
De loin meilleur que mon allemand d'ailleurs
It’s nice to see other countries’ Supreme Courts have an age cap
Ours in Canada have a obligatory retirement age of 75
For us we have 9 justices, but I don’t even know how they get the role
Your average citizen will barely discuss the SC unless a topic comes up and it’s kind of related
I know where’s one from my province but that’s all I know lol
That’s interesting
Does France not have an obligation for sitting members to have any background in law
Is it not a popular post-Presidency activity (serving on the court)
They're appointed by the governor general on the advice of the cabinet, so the governement decides who's going to be a supreme court judge
I can't think of a case where the government made a truly partisan choice though
I know that at least two (or maybe three
) of the judges must be trained with the french civil code because that's what we use in Québec, but appart from that, I also don't know much
Ahh
Cool
You forgot Kraftwerk
The greatest
I just said this same thing
Isn't he a global superstar
I do it, but I see plenty of people who don’t. So I wouldn’t find you not doing it to be cold in a major city in Canada
The only exception is I would find it cold if it was an empty bus and you walk to past the bus driver in the front without a word and get off
German
Oh so cute <3
There's something about the accent that gets me
Doesn't matter the dialect
They're all beautiful in their own way
And there are certain phrases and words which are cuter in their own way
I love it
I'm instantly attracted
i have a lot of German friends and my exes are Germans and my best friend is also German so i do have a good sample size
And why would they
Do you think Frenchmen expect people to speak to them in French in Ohio
Bananas are fucking delicious though
Such a weird thing to pick out to be derogatory
If you enter my home and refuse to take off your shoes, you better be some kind of trades worker (plumber, electrician, etc) or an inspector or else I’m gonna cut off your hands as a substitute
> we have a hallway without any rugs or carpet, only linoleum, so we can walk with our shoes on there
The hallway is the neutral zone, but the rooms are shoes free
This is perhaps the weirdest answer of them all - you got a hybrid thing going
> Isn't it kind of gross to have people walking around with their sweaty feet on your floor also
Far more preferable than shoes in the house
Yeah your initial explanation was weird but i understand now
We have them in most homes as well here too
A carpet is mandatory though because of the snow
Yes; carpet is the wrong word
We call gnocchi the original poor people food

Thanks
I'll keep an eye/ear out then :D
Lucky you
Good luck Netherlands :D
Scotland actually used to have an overseas colony here in Canada called New Scotland, aka Nova Scotia, NS even has Scottish based towns/cities like New Glasgow
On a tangent: wouldnt an EU of city states/regions be far stronger than the current model of countries
It would mean each « body » would be more dependent on each other and the EU network
I think its dumb personally
If you need to FORCE people then it’s not representative at all
Furthermore if you want higher voter turnout, reform the system to make it worth people’s interest
Right now turnouts are generally low due to apathy since for a lot of people their vote doesn’t matter
War crimes or not are a completely independent factor of self determination

I hate Facebook
Win/Win Situation for The EU
Really hope Facebook acts on this threat so a new Social Media platforms can be born and make traction
Bye
Damn, this makes my dream of moving to the Netherlands a little more enticing
"pay their dues"? By what fucking logic do you think facebook owes you anything
Ah, so you just have to the power to try and extort a bunch of money you aren't owed from some innocent third party, so you're going to exercise it
That's the extent of the "logic". That's what I thought
The EU is just a bunch of technocratic tyrants ruling over a compliant serfdom
I pity you people who have to live there
They infested everywhere else
I was a member there and followed what they did
The rhetoric just exists in a lot of other subs
The advantage to FPH was that all of that shit was concentrated in one place
Now it's everywhere
Unintended consequences
Man I hate WhatsApp, it would be great if I could message people on it from FB messenger though
Mabey insta too
Ideally it would become popular for people to use a messanging platform that doesn't scan all your personal message for advertising
>  taxes owed
Facebook doesn't owe you shit
You want money
Go build something yourself, rather than robbing those who *are* willing to do the work to build something
Pathetic
I think they were testing to merge all these apps so avoid anti competitive legislation in the eu
This isn't about taxes, it's about Facebook sharing intel with US authorities and European countries objecting
Well I'm sorry, but that's tough shit
You people voluntarily turned your continent into a bottomless cesspool of islamic militancy, which makes you a danger to the rest of us
You forfeited any right to not be looked on with suspicion by the rest of the world when you chose to do that
Countries like yours are not owed a single dime from the civilized world
**You** should be paying **us** for tolerating your miserable existence
I'll bet the person who put that there would claim to be tolerant, inclusive and not a hateful person at all
Also Brits when they're outside another country:
This is why when I travel I tell people I'm from Canada
Absolutely embarrassed to be an American

Serious question
Whats to stop say Apple from just including a Lighting to USB adapter inside the box of every device sold in the EU while just raising the price of the devices to offset the cost
I am a little worried about this
One one hand, fuck Apple
On the other, doesn't that impede innovation
If you develop a new charging method, how do you make it proprietary
If you do, how do you sell it when it's not the universal standard
It's not like the standard will be changed to your new and improved one
That would screw over all other other companies which will suddenly be unable to see in the EU
Should’ve offered to put a sidebar ad on it for a week and then fucked off with the cash

Have there been any consequences whatsoever for whichever bozos made the decision to use that flammable cladding
As a Canadian and a North American I don’t think this is fair for you guys
I have a lot of family who live in Germany France as well as friends in Spain and they live very conservatively
They bike and walk to places and they don’t use AC in this hot weather
Overall, culturally (habits) and statistically most Europeans don’t consume or spend as much as North Americans do
Here in Canada people talk about climate change but their actions don’t match their words
People idle their cars for half an hour just sitting on their phone or wait in a long line of cars just for a cup of coffee at Tim Hortons or a meal at McDonald’s. Street lights turn on at 5 PM when the sun is still up, stores keep their heat / AC and lights on 24 / 7 when there aren’t any customers
Restaurants and stores throw away hundreds of kilograms of food every single day and water is wasted all the time
And that’s only a glimpse of what we waste
On behalf of all Americans and Canadians, I’m sorry that you have to be the ones protesting and taking the consequences while we’re still consuming like there’s no tomorrow
Climate deniers respond by putting nooses around their necks, attached to seedlings
So did they die
I simply just use less
Unfortunately I can’t just bike everywhere because cities in Canada are much larger than Europe, plus our transit system is ass
So my friends and I carpool everyday
For small, mundane things like brushing my teeth, I use a cup and reduce the amount of water coming out, I used to shower longer bur now I shower in 5 mins, I use the fan instead of AC and in the winter I wear warm clothes instead of blasting my heat so high I get a nose bleed
I also started buying less clothes and washing with cold water, drying my clothes by hanging them instead of using the dryer
I replaced all of the lights in my house to LED
I’ve also switched to chicken instead of beef (slowly shifting)
And many more smaller things
Truth is, LED lights don’t use that much energy
It’s the oven, AC, heat, washer/dryer that kill
The big things like meat, transportation (primarily planes) and clothes are the stuff that are causing our death but unfortunately that is way out of our control
I believe anyone can do this but they are just not willing to because of conveniency and comfort
Don’t drag Messi into this

Hopefully it looks a little better now
I recall learning about what was happening last year in Europe
When quarantine was a radical concept to this young, innocent 21st century mind
I had friends that were saying if they quarantined here in Canada there would be people rioting against it because we wouldn't need it to isolate ourselves enough due to the distances between our cities
Thankfully that didn't happen but this isolation period has gone on for so long due to politicians trying to "stabilize the economy" that's its now destroying our tourism industry for another summer
Short sightedness and greed has increased the death toll here
And I grieve a little everytime I see those numbers
My heart goes out to those who have lost loved ones and those you have recovered but will face unknown challenges in the future
Please keep taking care of yourselves and others
The world united and the miracles of multiple vaccines within a year has been achieved
Something that could have been years in development
Now manufacturing is ramping up to insane levels, another magnificent achievement
Please remember the struggle and I hope the Perseverance from this threat continues drives us to change other policies in the future
Just make it a joke
r/jokes will report every week
I remember the police driving slow through my neighborhood in Milano at the time, repeating a message over the loud speaker to the effect of “There is a national mandatory quarantine
Stay inside for your own protection, the virus is among us”.
Pretty spooky as a foreigner to see, if society collapsed I was definitely not going to be high on any priority list lol
No I voluntarily stayed, and they had my info
I got COVID & recovered by then (April antibody tests confirmed), so I didn’t want to waste resources for something unnecessary
what a bad take
Woke up at 5 am here in Canada and was like welp, it's time to move wayyy the fuck up north
In canada it had all of those and then hatsune miku lol
I hope it's a paid parking lot
Everybody hates those

This photo is accurate to how I felt
While it's a striking image and an important reminder that climate change is a big deal, remember that this doesn't necessarily mean all that much in the grand scheme of things, just like how snow in winter doesn't prove climate change is a hoax

My man says this pretending the UK is much better than the USA LMFAOOO
Tell that to any former British colony ever

No you didn't lmao, which Apollo astronaut was British
This is a joke, right

Ohio is an American state
Quite the accomplishment that: *not dying* while living a life of luxury, pampered with mountains of cash and batteries of staff to look after your every need
All this with effectively no real responsibilities other than not interfering in the government
Why do people celebrate royalty again
Note, if she were to dissolve the monarchy -- condemn future generations to actually having to earn their place in society -- that would be impressive and something to celebrate
God her royal majesty the Queen Long May she reign
In Canada at least, in order to abolish the monarchy it would need the approval of both Houses of Parliament and all 10 provincial legislatures
The last time we tried to open the constitution, it almost lead to the breakup of the country
I'd be sad to see the monarchy go
To me, our British traditions (monarchy, parliament, etc)  are the only things keeping us culturally different from the United States
And given what's happened in US politics lately, I want nothing do with that nation
Arguably have children born to the purple was a fantastic way to destroy your legacy in Rome

> Every white person in america can tell you exactly what kind of european descendant they are
??? Europeans are probably the best in the world at sounding fucking stupid while attempting to make a grand sanctimonious point
>Black american people aren't saying white people have no cultures
They're denying the existence of a unified "white culture".
Black Americans don't deny the existence of White American culture
Hahaha how the fuck would someone from *Bulgaria* know
I posted this earlier:
>Like it or not, a "White American" with a midwestern accent, slinging cheeseburgers, watching American Football, practicing his specific brand of 'stars and stripes 'patriotism, and going to his American-style Church, is a man with an entirely unique White American culture

Because the PM isn't directly elected
When you vote you vote for your local member of parliament to represent your riding in government
From there, the Queen then chooses someone from parliament who has the confidence of parliament to run the government as PM
(Theoretically)
Practically that means the leader of the largest party in parliament is chosen to be PM, as it can be assumed they have their parties support, and therefore have the most support in parliament out of any other MP
This leads to people voting more with the leader of the party in mind more than the MP
For example, if you want the Labour leader to be your PM, you vote for your Labour MP
Most don't even consider their MPs stance on certain issues compared to the official party's stance
If of course parliament looses confidence in their ability to lead government, a vote of no-confidence is held and if they loose their no long PM
When a PM resigns the new leader of their party is chosen as PM as it can be said that since they have the largest party begins them, they have the confidence of Parliament
Of course this doesn't mean Johnson isn't an elected official
He was elected MP in his riding, just as all other PMs were

The idea is that if a candidate is from a disadvantaged group, they will have had a more difficult time achieving the same things as someone who isn't as disadvantaged, so they will in fact be more competent than their metrics suggest
For example, if you have one candidate who came from a rich family and one who came from a poor family, and they have the same grade point average, you can be fairly certain that the person from a poor family had to work harder for it than the person from the rich family
Thus it makes sense to hire the poor person, all else being equal
Now I'm sure everyone will be eager to argue that women aren't disadvantaged, but I just wanted to point out that it does make sense to consider more about the person you're hiring than just their grades, or work experience, or other simple metrics
Dank memes are above the law

I was moderately against Scotland leaving during its independence referendum, but after Brexit I'm now one hundred in favor of Scottish independence

Overall, I think our country should be making laws more lenient
Nudity in nature imo is perfectly fine
But most of our nudity laws are outdated and barely ever enforced, so they need to be updated
I'm not really as supportive of nudity in high traffic areas though, because it presents a health safety issue

I almost forgot how big ISIS used to be, seems all countries involved with obliterating them from the sky did a great job
This is a good point, however I think it's worth acknowledging that a) the Jim Crow era (back when lynchings were a thing) is significantly worse than "an incompetent actor as president", and really ended only ~50 years ago, and b) the world has changed a lot in the past few decades with regards to the dissemination of information (thus greatly empowering speech)
This empowerment is generally a good thing, as it generally empowers 'good' speech (e.g. the vast majority of communication by professionals), but it also empowers negative speech (e.g. people advertising racist views) and gives the ability for once fringe ideas to latch onto people's emotions and gain a following (see incels)
You can see that this is recent empowerment is most people's concern because the vase majority of talk of silencing is about modern media (social media); people rarely, if ever, talk about shutting down newspapers, books, radio, even film (although occasionally speeches)
You can still think that total free speech should be a thing (although it should be pointed out that defamation, harassment, and threats are exempted from this totality), but relying *solely* on a continuity of history seems a bit risky to me
I think there's a time and place (the middle ground)
No problem restricting intolerance from the majority of social settings, so long as there is a place for it (e.g. banning it from the majority of subreddits, but not from reddit in general)
You don't want to allow a platform for them to advertise their views, nor an opportunity for the harassment of those they discriminate against (including hate speech)
That said, you also want to be aware of hate so to keep an eye on it and be able to engage with the honest people of the movement whose racism may yet be changed (e.g. people who are not malicious, but ignorant/unaware of the goals and importance of social justice and its contemporary forms)
It's good to have places where people can be open about this (for the possibility of rehabilitation, among other reasons), but there's no reason that this needs to have the freedom be anywhere
It seems we disagree on many things (particularly on what is social justice, which is a whole other can of worms---I suspect the social justice you and I see differ greatly)
I don't really know the source of our disagreements because you haven't really given any explanation or argument---your only point you have made is that you don't want ideology festering underground in your original post, which is what my previous comment addresses---but I will do my best to state my points
Regarding the first point, people are rarely rational, and often far more emotionally driven
Allowing for the advertisement of Nazi (e.g.) ideology allows these ideologies to capitalize on this irrational state by connecting with these emotions (this is how you get things like immigration control---which is not inherently partisan---being conflated with the far right)
If you do not want these people to grow their following, it is simplest to cut off their recruitment
Regarding the second, I'm not entirely sure what you disagree with
Are you saying that this type of harassment should be tolerated
> I don't think that people flocking to extremism happens because extremism is allowed freedom to speak
It happens through high levels of dissatisfaction (and/or poor education)
I think it's because of both reasons
You see this especially with youth, discontent leads them to look for 'rebellious' perspectives, and they generally latch on to one of the first ones that appeals to them
These movements do engage in recruitment efforts, and they do it because it works
We agree that it's important to create an environment where racism/etc
cannot thrive (although I'd maybe use the higher bar of an environment where discrimination not only doesn't thrive, but where it doesn't persist)
However, for me part of this process is ensuring that these movements cannot gain a following in the meantime
And shutting down the promotion of these ideologies is certainly one method of doing so
> The issue with restricting freedoms is that it sounds good until the people you don't agree with are in charge
Let's be clear, I am not talking about silencing people I merely disagree with
I disagree with you, and I think it would be unacceptable for your statements to be silenced
Obviously a much higher bar is necessary
It's also worth pointing out that if some of the speech I would consider acceptable to restrict got power, I'd have much bigger concerns than my speech (namely my and my family's life, livelihood, home)
This is why it is hard for me to agree with you that it's *always* morally unjustifiable to curtail speech (although of course it is often unjustifiable)
For example, I think it certainly would've been morally justified (or imperative) to break up Nazi rallies around 1930
This doesn't necessarily translate to movements today, but it is why I disagree with your absolute value of free speech
> I'm saying that if you get harassed on an anonymous board then you can close your web browser (and how the hell to people even know what to harass you with
Or you can trust reddit's voting system, which curtails this shit even on loosely moderated boards
De-platforming doesn't work, it just pushes things underground
I agree with you on your last point (and it's something I have addressed above), but it's worth pointing out that not all harassment is over the internet (and real life harassment is that much more harmful)
Furthermore harassment on reddit (with its anonymity and discussion format) is significantly less persistent than on media like twitter where it's a lot more difficult to escape or ignore since it's tied with your account
This harassment can be quite pernicious and exhausting, I personally could not wish it on anyone
> See, here's the thing
Hate speech isn't "hateful speech" it's "speech that the current powers hate". It's not a precedent I want
This is something where I think we have more in common
I think much speech harmful to the powers that be is already impeded, if not restricted (for example, threats of defamation suits ensure that you have to be very careful when criticizing these powers)
Frankly, I don't see many of the victims of 'hate speech' having much power in my country, so I don't see much justification for your interpretation of the phrase
I personally am comfortable with the precedent of targeting 'hateful speech' (to use your phrase), so long as the legal definition of the term is both clear and well maintained (so as to keep it from being a tool of tyranny)
I think Canada has a [decent example] of such a definition to my amateur eye, although I'm sure there is a higher standard
> I think this modern push by governments to curtail free speech is the exact same
They use a boogeyman (the far right) to try to get the average person to give up more of their rights to the government
It's interesting, because I think for a lot of far right movements the government is the boogeyman
I think this "the government wants your rights" argument applies to some countries, but not for many
I certainly don't buy it with respect to Canada: the party in power changes frequently enough that it wouldn't work as a partisan motivation (the parties are too busy pushing policies that appeal to their base), and it's hard to see any long term trend that would mark a bipartisan (or institutional) push
I am curious how you see this happening in your own country
I also think it's worth distinguishing 'free speech' meaning freedom from government regulation, 'free speech' meaning free from community/corporate regulation (like facebook/subreddit censorship), and 'free speech' meaning freedom from all regulation (like protesters shouting down a speaker)
My arguments are generally agnostic about what ends up shutting down intolerance, but there are different concerns for each of them (some of which you have raised)
This Trump voter shoulda just went to Charlottesville instead

"Liberal and conservative at the same time
" is amusing to me in context since that's basically the Democratic Party in the US
It's generally a result of a plurality (FPTP) system vs proportional system that yields these results
The main reason we don't have as much of that in Canada as in the US probably has to do with our politics being somewhat more regional in many cases

Chang Kai Shek fought with the knowledge it was unwinnable against the Japanese but wanted to show the Allies he was serious to try and muster any available support against Japan while fighting on his own
We're talking about an estimated 3 to 4 million military dead or missing on the Chinese side fighting against Japan
This is not even mentioning just how brutal the fighting was given how the Japanese military command viewed the Chinese (another 7-8 million civilian deaths due to military activity)

Kinda glad us Canadians stuck with the Metric System as well
It definitely is less of a mess
I mean, while measuring height is more often done in feet and inches, and is one way the metric system isn't too confusing, I do know doctors use centimeres on official documents and such
Metric time keeping is the worst thing I have ever heard of
Good luck with that
Back when they first made imperial units, it was really difficult to divide things up evenly in anything other than 2
So they measure things in halves (1/2), quarters ((1/2)/2), eighths (((1/2)/2)/2), sixteenths ((((1/2)/2)/2)/2), etc
It makes perfect sense
64ths is (1/2)^(6)
It was also the basis for the Fahrenheit scale (0 is freezing point of brine, 32 is freezing point of water

> The abortion can be done only during first 12 weeks if the pregnancy was a result of a criminal act ie rape
From what I've read most of these are not carried out because Polish courts don't move fast enough to prove a rape within 12 weeks
Serbia is already a shit hole
Still will be when all the western countries turn into Pakistan, in fact
>This court ruling removes the grounds upon which the vast majority of abortions take place in Poland
In 2017, Polish government data reported that 1,035 of the 1,057 abortions (97
9%) that took place were on the grounds of severe foetal anomaly
The proportion of abortions carried out on this ground has steadily increased every year since 1994: while abortions to preserve life or health accounted for 88
1% of all legal abortions in 1994, by 2017 they had fallen to 2
1%.
> Meanwhile, abortion on the grounds of rape is vanishingly rare in Poland today
In 2017, not a single termination on these grounds was granted, in a country of 38 million people
> Obtaining a legal abortion in Poland already took weeks or months because of administrative barriers and opposition from obstructive doctors, and these delays will be exacerbated by the new ruling
> In some regions of eastern Poland, it is effectively impossible to obtain an abortion because all medical facilities have declared themselves conscientious objectors to abortion
In other regions, legal advocates report that anti-abortion doctors deliberately delay patients, mislead them about their legal entitlement to abortion, or tell them that such procedures are not available in their region
> "In practice it takes weeks, sometimes months," to obtain a legal abortion, said Karolina Wieckiewicz, a lawyer and activist with the group Abortion Without Borders (Polish: Aborcja bez granic)
"Some people decide to risk the battle in Poland; others look for alternatives
It's not easy to be granted a legal abortion in Poland, even before the recent ruling

Wait are you kidding
Don’t you guys get seasonal depression though
It helps if you believe in it
There's no evidence for vitamin supplements preventing depressive symptoms in the winter
Not even vitamin D, it's just a myth that seems to have spread everywhere
Yes, there is a correlation between vitD levels and depressive symptoms
But guess what, there a pretty significant confounding factor: the sun
Supplementing with vitamin d helps depression just as much as not eating ice cream prevents drowning
High vitD is just a marker of getting sunlight, and sunlight prevents depression
Here's a couple of randomized, double-blinded studies showing no effect of vitamin D supplementation on the seasonal affective disorder or depression:
That could do the trick
Also modern sunbeds emit UVB so you get vitamin D from them
There's the skin cancer risk though so I wouldn't overdo it
When I still lived in Finland I would sometimes go to the sunbed during the winter, not so much for the tan, but because it made me feel awesome after not feeling the sun on my skin for months
Instant mood boost
Sure, that I agree with
However the main and perhaps only benefit is better bone health, and even there a medium dose is better than high as recent placebo-controlled trials have shown
Long-lasting vitD supplementation has failed to prevent for example cancer, diabetes, allergies (to name a few) despite the big hype 10-15 years ago
It's seems evident now that the reason for the correlation between high vitD levels and health is that people who are more active (outdoors) and have better diets, also have better vitD status
What have the Romans ever done for Romania, eh
Should just keep it, it's better than most other Romanian roads
Now I'm kinda curious about what Lenin would have to say about the Empire and Star Wars in general
That’s most people always
The majority are always against protests and pro status quo
The majority never matter in measures of protests all that matter is that a group is dedicated enough to keep pushing and fighting for change even in the face of apathy and dislike by the public
Thank god there are no Finns running around or who knows what might happen
Even men's clothes looked uncomfortable back then, but women's clothes looked like torture chambers

So Russia invades our airspace all the time but we’re not even considered as one of the gang
Fuck Russia
All my non-mentioned homies hate Russia
motherfuckers what do we have to do
Did it ever occur to you that Russia is a part of Europe lmao
Like based on the name of the sub I would assume that there would be posts about Russia that aren’t always negative and political
But alas, here we are
These are rookie numbers, gotta pump up those numbers
Ffs what do we need to do to make that list
Very rude

My ex who dumped me is also pissed I'm fucking women better than her now
What did Canada do wrong to not be included
We had our troops in Ukraine during the annex moment a couple years back
Also Serbia, Venezuela, Cuba, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, maybe Iran and Iraq
I saw this organically the first time I went to Europe
Hee hee
Needs more cake
So that's where all of our snow went this year
Curious, what parts of Europe regularly use snow tires
Where I was from in the US, no one even knew they existed
Hanz, get ze snowblower
I thought it never snows in Austria
Especially since it's summer down there this time of year
Logic doesn't matter when pussy is on the line my dude
Oh shut up
This isn't a good look for the Germans, Belgium takes the lead in the ever-competitive small arms race between them and the Germans
For now
Europe is so warm, it's so weird for me to think that my latitude is about equivalant to central france yet the weather is more like

Fuck Europe looks beautiful wow
Uhh there has actually been cases on all contients by now, sadly, including a Antartica, although I do believe it was only in the south South America region of the continent
Even Nunavut, which had nunav'it until a month or two ago is now under lockdown with some of the most cases per capita per territory/province though Alberta is still #1 in that statistic
Not sure if Nunavut passed Quebec yet either
Italians have the better cuisine, the French have the technique
French cuisine isn’t nearly as popular as Italian cuisine worldwide, but French cooking techniques are used everyday by many people across the world
Both cultures have contributed immensely to food/cooking culture, but nothing beats Italian cuisine
Fair, I don't have the numbers
That statement was based on my personal experience, you're right
In my opinion, though, I don't think French cuisine is less popular in North America for any reason other than that it seems to be less accessible than Italian food
Most French restaurants in North America - at least in my experience - are high-end and are usually somewhere you'd go exclusively for dinner
There aren't many places (outside Quebec, perhaps) that offer French "fast food", if you will
With that being said though, pâtisserie are quite common here and are only growing in popularity, which I didn't originally take into account when I made the statement about Italian cuisine being more popular
Regardless, French cuisine is legendary and France has probably contributed more overall to the culinary arts in the West than any other nation
Quebec cuisine is heavily inspired by French cuisine (of course), but they’re not the same
France could never produce the absolute monstrosity that is poutine
That’s something only the harsh winters of Quebec can produce
> but the implementation is subpar
Depends on where you go
I’ve had poutine that was terrible and thrown in the garbage after 2 bites, and I’ve also had duck fat poutine with quality cheese curds from Quebec from an upscale restaurant and it was the best comfort food I’ve ever had in my life
Poutine might be extremely simple, but it’s also really easy to fuck it up, kind of like pizza
This guys never seen dumb and dumber
They sell paisley blue and orange suits every year for prom
Who is attacking them
So what is the solution here
Macron will say some big words, but ultimately, keep bringing them in
Having more consumers is good for corporate profits
Ditto for other neoliberal politicians
Leftists, if in power, would also keep welcoming them in, not for the benefit of corporations, but to do otherwise would be offensive
And then there's Le Pen, but the French people seem to want to try everything except for actually solving the problem
Macron is a neoliberal on steroids
Neoliberals aren't "lefties" though, but their end game is the same as the far right
Neoliberals tend to sprinkle just enough "progressive" social policies to get progressives to vote for them while said progressives have their unions busted and their jobs exported to China or India
/r/notinteresting
There's nothing "quality" about this shitpost

Regardless of the decision made, I think it's really fucked up how many EU Europeans like to squash anyone that go against them in the slightest
You all do the same thing to the US and Russia while maintaining that you're somehow superior
Maybe try to be more like the Canadians where they at least pretend to be nice

The ECJ has already ruled that monitoring of online activity is prohibited
As enforcement of Article 13 requires monitoring, this is a good angle of attack
This was expressly stated by academics years ago, as the article was in violation of the Charter and contradicted article 15 of the e-commerce directive
Source: my wife was one of said academics (PhD, copyright law)
(Just checked with the wife so I don't say anything stupid)
Article 15 basically says that the state can't oblige intermediaries to monitor activities
The keyword here is *intermediaries*.  The state can monitor you all it wants (indeed the UK is rather obsessed with this), but it can't oblige Google to do its dirty work
There's nothing stopping Google from doing it on its own accord (read: ContentID), but the state can't impose that
Of course, this doesn't mean that governments don't try anyway (*cough snooper's charter cough*) but that doesn't make it legal
Filtering requires monitoring, as you can't make a decision about whether you should filter something without first monitoring for it
This alone means Article 13 of this bill violates 15 of the other
I mean, you can use the ghosts to open bottles as well

Do cars in Europe come with "block heaters"?
Here in Canada almost every car is sold with a block heater that you can plug into which keeps the oil warm when the car is not running
It makes cars start so much easier this way
I have a really strong armchair interest in the world before 1914 and for anyone that can read French this is a really cool book:
It's basically a travel blog by a French journalist who lived in Germany and goes around visiting places and interviewing people
He's really positive about it, actually
The book has about 400 pictures as well, four or so every few pages as you read along

I always find it interesting that Reddit often says that right now we're living in the worst time possible and people shouldn't have children
Bitch you don't think people who lived through WW1, WW2, the Spanish Flu etc
had it worse
You seriously think that right now as you type from the comfort of your own home on your super computer $1k phone is worse than the people who went thru that shit
And they still had kids
They still had hope for a future, as per "the war to end all wars

They've done wonders repairing and redoing the layouts over the last few years
More parks and pedestrian space and less ugly street stores
4-5 thousand people that showed up in Moscow are a pittance
More people show up for Starbucks opening
In Toronto Canada they started doing the bike lanes between the parked cars and the sidewalk
so it’s sidewalk, bike lane, parking and then street so the cyclists are completely away from the street
works well
Sadly it's not really surprising with no cure and no vaccine the best you can is delay the spread
And unless a cure or vaccine is developed all of the world's countries are going to end up in roughly the same place it's just a question of when
I wonder what the history books will say
Did the rest of the world boondoggle the response because the second wave hit outside care homes harder or will the USA non response be viewed as a success because they didn't tank their economy with lockdowns
Who knows

I just recently got back from visiting Japan
The apartments in Tokyo or any of the surrounding cities are TINY
The bathrooms in a few of the places I stayed in were so compact that the sinks moved over to cover the toilet so you could shower (all in one room, no shower curtain, etc
if that makes sense)
Taking the railway system during rush hour is nuts
Just when you think you can't fit anymore people in one of the cars, ten more squeeze in somehow
They even have designated cars for "women only" for those that fear they'll be groped or something (but women are still welcome to ride on the other cars)
That being said, not all of Japan is like that
Kyoto and Osaka were pretty comfortable
The few things mentioned above certainly made for an experience, and not a negative one
Just a completely different lifestyle than what a lot of us are used to
In Finland only half of the population is currently complaining about the heat
The other half is complaining about the ones complaining about the heat
I remember in high school, I was doing research in art class, and looking up a reference photo of a German tank, as I wanted to draw a piece of a battle scene where it was in the centre, getting straffed by an aircraft
After some time a teacher that came to talk with my art teacher saw my work and asked me about it
I told him the general layout and we got to talking about the war and the occupation (I told him that my grandmother grew up in occupied Netherlands among other things), and about a book I was reading for English Class, about a boy who was sent with his sibling and mother from Hungary in 1944 to the contration camp system
And he then showed me a video he took on his phone from a visit to one of the concentration camp museums
It was 2-3 minutes long, and all it was all shoes
Stacked in massive piles, from one side of the warehouse, to the other
Meters deep, on both walls, with a corridor to walk through
And the video was just him walking in the corridor, pexi glass pane after the next of just stacks of leather shoes
For minutes
At that point I've seen standard documentary footage of War Crimes from that time
The guy gets shot in the head and falls in the pit, the burning peasants house in the eastern front, the London Blitz, the liberated camp survivors barely able to stand
But that video gave me a new perspective
A visual of numbers so enormous I couldn't even guess how many people those shoes belonged to
People who wouldn't be able to own a second or spare pair of shoes, people who lived and loved, people who used to exist
I don't understand how anyone would be able to deny that people were shot, burnt, starved, and erased from the face of the earth in 6 years
Glad you didn't post the piles of golden tooth crowns
I remember the Romans did the same thing after conquering Gaul
Horse-led carts would trot through the streets of Rome as returning soldiers would throw gifts - loot - into the crowd
This was a part of Julius Caesar’s way of siding with/pleasing the mob, further maintaining them in his corner
Other people’s personal possessions and the sentimental values attached to them were completely erased
I was on the beach two weeks ago
It definitely looked liked the first picture then
Do you have a link to a story about this
I can't find word of this happening anywhere other than this comment
I'm not even British or European but even I know you just took a picture of the trash news section
Not the actual news
The New York Post - based on its format and headlines - looks like a tabloid to me when I see it on stands (not like in the OP, but still)
Am I mistaken
There’s a saying that goes something like “God made the earth but man made the Netherlands
Damn I just watched a movie about his meeting with other nazi officials where they discussed how to “find a answer to the Jewish question”and it was just fucked

The French should be relatively happy despite the problems
The US gets congressmen who argue that it's false that not having health insurance is bad for you

Brits should think carefully about how much May likes Trump and the GOP when they vote in their next elections
There's a pretty good chance that some things you need and depend on are going to disappear under her tenure

it worked for hillary: you "leak" a ton of emails, it damages their reputation as people insist they're full of horrible things, then it turns out the majority of them are fake or pointless non-confidential memos, but it's too late
Le Pen is a right wing national supremacist
Don't insult *yourself* by pretending she isn't, you know better

So I was a little weirded out on Saturday by the highway written in huge bold white letters on the side of a building was written Remember Armenian Genocide with the dates
Turns out we have a local Armenian school
I don't think that there is denial as so much as arguing death toll and definition of genocide
I hear a lot more of "we killed some, but it doesn't count
Since when is Russia considered European
It's an actual issue so what to you Euro's think about it

It's so weird to me hearing how Scandinavians are getting less snow than I've been getting in Eastern Ontario (fairly south in Canada), on a weirdly warm winter
Haven't yet gotten enough stable below freezing weather for rinks to be good :'(
We have gotten some snow, but not a whole lot, since most of the dumps keep melting after the weather goes above 0° again

Another similar letter to look at, with similar "colourful" language is the Cossacks letter to the sultan, [
That reads as, from wikipedia:
"Zaporozhian Cossacks to the Turkish Sultan
O sultan, Turkish devil and damned devil's kith and kin, secretary to Lucifer himself
"What the devil kind of knight are thou, that canst not slay a hedgehog with your naked arse
The devil shits, and your army eats
"Thou shalt not, thou son of a whore, make subjects of Christian sons
We have no fear of your army; by land and by sea we will battle with thee
Fuck thy mother
"Thou Babylonian scullion, Macedonian wheelwright, brewer of Jerusalem, goat-fucker of Alexandria, swineherd of Greater and Lesser Egypt, pig of Armenia, Podolian thief, catamite of Tartary, hangman of Kamyanets, and fool of all the world and underworld, an idiot before God, grandson of the Serpent, and the crick in our dick
Pig's snout, mare's arse,  slaughterhouse cur, unchristened brow
Screw thine own mother
" So the Zaporozhians declare, you lowlife
You won't even be herding pigs for the Christians
Now we'll conclude, for we don't know the date and don't own a calendar; the moon's in the sky, the year with the Lord
The day's the same over here as it is over there; for this kiss our arse

Where was your great wisdom before the vote
I don't like this graph
They are categorizing nuclear in a bad way IMO
On the flip-side, burning of biomass (wood) is considered "renewable", even though that's only the case over the short term
The forests here in Nova Scotia are currently being clear-cut and shipped to Europe and other markets to be burned for electricity
The problem with that (aside from the carbon emissions) is that [clear-cutting is unsustainable
] Every time it happens, the soil is degraded of nutrients and also erodes, until eventually it's not capable of supporting a forest
Greece is somewhat up there

I think that's why the USA will always have a class divide
We make a lot in our family and the idea of moving someplace with higher taxation than we already have (Quebec) really starts to sting
Between income taxes, property taxes and sales taxes, I think we're lucky to keep 35% of our income
If/when you reach the point where you go "Why is the government entitled to more of my money than I am
", you start to think about places with less taxation more favourably
Thus the class divide
A better tax situation is going to attract more people with money
> Didn't really expect so many people to oversimplify the problems of the US to "scary minorities" and "lack of homogeneity".
Why does that surprise you
Minorities are not well-treated
When you force people into a lower caste, how do you expect them to be homogenous
I know here a ton of people use natural gas in the winter as opposed to electricity

There's a gruesome movie on Netflix called [Nazi Concentration Camps] It was produced in 1945-46 as evidence for the Nuremberg Trials, and has not been altered before being uploaded to Netflix
A narrator describes the conditions, purposes, and horrors of each camp used by the Nazis
One by one, their names briefly appear on the screen before footage proceeds to show bodies piled upon bodies, corpses clinging to life, and Allied soldiers and medics trying to make sense of the autrocities
During this, the narrator calmly describes what took place
Within minutes, they move to the next camp
Despite each camp being given only a brief overview, the film is about an hour long
It is horrifying, very NSFL, and does not try to answer any of the "big questions" to help us make sense of it all
And yet, I truly believe that it is a must see for everyone who is trying to learn more about the Holocaust
We often hear of the major camps and the gas chambers, and I've heard a bit about other aspects of the Holocaust, but I truly did not grasp the sheer scale and impersonal bureaucracy of the Holocaust until viewing this film
If you don't have Netflix, [you can also watch Nazi Concentration Camps (in lower quality) here
In case you still need some persuading since this is quite sad to learn about, I'll finish this comment with the words enshrined on the monument marking the mass grave at the Majdanek death camp
Don't let their deaths be in vain

I was going to say "We get 28 Celsius in Western Canada every Summer, nearly every day". But I forget that in the western part of Canada \(the prairies\), it's a dry heat, which is so much easier to put up with than humid heat
We had a taste of that humid heat during an unusually foggy, rainy, humid summer last year, and WOW it was bad sometimes
You could say that, Finland is
Finnished *puts on shades*

Getting 27 today - tomorrow is even worse at 29
Thankfully I no longer live in a humid place

Never heard of that
It helps when there is snow to step out to
Interesting
Not sure why they would be designed that however
How do you shower or wash dishes
Cold water
What temperature is it this week
. Seems about right
Heck during most winter I keep heating to 10 “just in case” but the building is generally warm enough
Oh so the heating is done by water
10 degrees is a tad close but not freezing
That snow though for May is ridiculous lol
I can't help but wonder if glass towers like these will become increasingly anachronistic in the post Coivd-19 world
We're already seeing the IT and financial sectors of the economy moving permanently towards having many people working from home, and anybody who spent the quarantine trapped inside a tiny downtown condominium has come to the appreciate what it must be like to have a backyard
I can see cities becoming increasingly decentralized in the coming years, as the need to gather physically becomes less important, and we become more accustomed to meeting remotely

How come Remain didn't do enough to inform the people, then
Did Leave communicate their message better

Remain would do better a second time around only because of the shambles that Brexit has become

That monument, there are blocks on the other side and in each is soil from the places the Dutch fought
So I was told anyway
My grandfather was one of those who died fighting to liberate the Netherlands
Its sad to see his sacrifice is unable to be remembered this year but I am sure it will be next year when this situation is under control
Damn I was close
"The wall contains eleven urns with soil from World War II execution grounds and war cemeteries in each of the Dutch provinces
Ill chalk it up to enjoying too many beers afterwards
I’m glad to know that his sacrifice and that of others are still remembered
I do wish I could have met him but I guess knowing he did his part so others could know their grandparents will have to be enough
Thats really cool to see

If they won't let Moldova in the EU, why would they ever let in Scotland
Did they replace it with the Scottish flag
Who needs Scotland when we have *New Scotland* anyway
No Tesla but they get to be masters at home
Brussels won't be imposing their onerous standards and telling them what to do
You can't put a price on freedom

Does anyone think that the locals get bored of looking at those mountains every day
I’m Canadian so I don’t know what the Dutch PM looks like, but I presume he’s the fit guy on a bike and not the middle-aged gentleman getting out of the car, which is what most non-Trudeau PMs in Canada resemble
It's really neat to see, and totally worth a day trip during the off season
No need for more than a day though, it's one big tourist trap
What can I say, make fun of Kevin Costner all you want but Waterworld is an inspirational classic
God, that was Such a TERRIBLE movie
On the flipside, Field of Dreams is an absolute delight

This is kind of how st Catherine's street in Montréal (our main drag downtown) will look after the construction is done

Fk "khrushchyovki".
I'm sorry mate, but it's really not a matter of guesswork at this point
It's a matter of what's already been demonstrated to work
The UN, WHO, and a number of NGOs have been running education campaigns on the matter in developing nations for over two decades now, and targeting women is ultimately what has proven to be most effective
It's what's responsible for the massive reduction of rates in nations like Sudan, where rates among women aged 15–49 sat at 87% back when the data was collected in 2016, while ages 0–14 were down to 32%.
Or Ethiopia, the nation your study is about, which went from 74% to 24%. Egypt went from 87% to 14%, Eritrea went from 83% to 33%, Guinea went from 97% to 46%, Burkina Faso went from 76% to 13%, and Sierra Leone went all the way from 90% to 13%.
I don't want to come across as disrespectful or anything, but the reality of the situation is that you've really only done the most cursory bit of research into the matter
The actual experts and professionals who have dedicated themselves to this issue have built their stance on a far more thorough understanding the matter better than either of us have, and on the basis of real-world evidence which ultimately points toward specifically targeting "the most FGM wanting group of the community" being the most effective course of action
Keep in mind that it's a chart which includes everyone up to 49 year olds, and the world has changed quite a bit over the past 50 years
For comparison, [here's a chart on the 15-49 age group] using the same data as the map above, and [here's a chart on the 14 and under age group] which is much more reflective of current rates, though not quite as widely encompassing in terms of the number of countries surveyed
All data is from 2016, and rates have continued to fall since then
That background looks photoshopped
If you remove the buildings it will just look like apartments
Same watermark on both photos
Paris has its share of drab concrete apartments too
Some of the suburbs are pretty grim
Fuck the EU
If they ever need a larger political structure to belong to, they could join us, I guess
The Royal Family would have to move here, though
Where they gonna go lmao is England like the turtle lion in avatar the last airbender
The UK was always a Trojan horse for American interests and objected to any type of deep integration in the EU
Overall, this is a great day for the EU
This will lead to closer integration and better European institutions
How's it keep up with the news like that
Manchester has to become Womanchester though
Not negotiable
The UK lacks real estate, and Canada lacks a lot of people
Seems like a good exchange
Pretty neat historical artifact

At least they didn't include East Prussia or the Sudetenland

Without sunlight was an exaggeration, but red heads produce vitamin D with less sunlight, i.e. More efficiently

Is your far right party crazy like the orthers or its closer to the conservative ?
Was not expecting the far right and conservatives to participate in this sort of thing
Anywhere is better than the US
Internet points; any excuse to attack the US is like a printing press
100% internet points; look at it go to the top
If someone *really* didn't want to be/care about the US they wouldn't have even considered the thought
Those marginals party are everywhere so im not suprised
Are you implying that Syrians are horrible people
If anything Syria is in the state it is thanks to the Americans
Well yeah of course

In Canada we usually lose power during massive storms like that

I honestly wonder what would have happened to the UK if Germany was not at all interested in advancing East into Russia (and assuming Russia was also happy to stay back) and brought their full attention to the Western front
Might make a cool "alternate history" film
It's impossible to have a passport from Singapore and another country
You have to give up the other passport to get Singapore's

There is basically an entire subdivision that was under water
This is the price the Belgians must pay for being such naughty boys in 1830
Italy is there saying that they’ll make sure that your ready before you leave us, and when they do leave their parents choke up
While Sweden just locks the door on you and gives you a blanket if your parents love you enough
That graph
uses intensity
instead of brightness
Honestly, this isn't exclusive to America either
I often heard stories from former peers here in Canada about their parents doing that shit to them
Most of them are from outside the metropolitan centers, so they're basically (culturally) not too far removed from Suburban America
Here in Toronto you see the opposite
Lot of immigrants and generations of families from across Europe, South Asia, and East Asia
All cultures where the kids staying home *forever* or just a really long time until they're settled financially and career wise, isn't exactly new
Cultural reasons, plus economic reasons with housing being absurdly expensive means if we have it good might as well stay (we inherent many aspects from our neighbors to the south and the perception of housing as a luxury not a necessity is one of them)
I don't know a single person who was born and raised in my city that moved out of their parents homes
Sounds just like North America
I would know, as a Canadian
Happy to be living in Finland now though, but it's presently rather tough to find a job here too, especially since I only speak a modicum of Finnish

Rest of the song:
*Our Scottish friend still clad in kilt continued down the street*
*He hadnt gone 10 yards or more
when a girl he chanced to meet*
*She said, Ive heard whats under there,
Please tell me if its so
*He said,Why dont you reach right up,
And give yourself a go
*She stuck her hand right up his kilt
And Great was her surprise
*She looked up at the Scotsman
He had twinkles in his eyes*
*She cried,Why Sir thats gruesome
And then she heard him roar*
*He said,If you reach up once again
Youll find its grew some more
*The Scotmans Hands were numb with drink
His head was spinning round
*He couldnt get that ribbon off
So homeward he was bound*
*His wife she caught a flash of blue
As he took off all his clothes*
*And it piqued her curiosity
as you might well suppose
*Well then she asked that Scotsman*
*Where hed been and what hed done*
*He said there was a contest at the pub
And that hed won*
*She cried, You did not show that thing
In front of all those men
*I did not show it all my love
But just enough to win
I like how Greece and North Macedonia are still next to each other and can still be mad at each other

Canada has had 23 PMs since 1867
Only 4 between 1900-1948
12 since 1948
If you take out all the ones that never actually won an election
We've had 16 since 1867
6 between 1867-1948
Forced leadership changes can often turn into crownings, just as they can when there are none
Russia is actually a perfect example of this, as they initially had presidential term limits
Putin and the party put up Dmitry Medvedev as their chosen successor, crowning him as President
They then got rid of term limits and returned Putin to the presidency
I like how they look like a spartan helmet

I wish these callouts came with a sourced list
Because as it is, it's words against words
I want to believe you
Are you just appealing to my sense of standing up for misrepresented people though
Is OP trying to misrepresent things for some reason
I dunno
Both of you are claiming you are right with no sources
Obviously it's my responsibility to research on my own but still, ffs, posters and commenters alike keep making all these claims and no one ever sources
Well now I want to visit the Netherlands and get arrested for something nice and small
The final boss should be Putin

Do those countries not give Visas to skilled workers
> Having the chance to apply for a Visa is not the same as an unrestricted right to move and then just say "oh hi, I'm here now".
I didn't say it was, but generally for skilled workers it'll most likely be a straightforward process to getting work in other countries, Canadians have to do it to work in the states
They have to actually pass a plan first though, right
I legit don't understand if that's a foregone conclusion, or if their politicians are able to just keep kicking that can down the road
Oh dang, that's harsh
I thought there was still a chance it wasn't going to go through
Yeah, I just wrongly assumed that not getting anything done would result in not leaving the EU at all
Oh man, I really love these
We even have something similar in [Toronto] and my goal is to buy one someday
The American military industrial complex is a thousand times more corrupt and bureaucratic than any European institution could ever be
Yet somehow they manage to have a competent army
An EU army would be a million times leaner, more competitive and controlled
And it would also get along with Russia
That's why the US fears the possibility
Seems like an off idea to me, but I'm a grungy north american
You would integrate the army
The affect of the World Wars on US integration (the centralized American identity overtaking regional and state identities in the imaginations of the troops and personnel) was notable
Racial integration (still a long ways to go since Americans for the most part are extremely racist still) also was boosted by integration in the army early on (relative to civil rights movements of the 60s)
This is literally all caused by the **British**. Wherever they go, they fuck shit up
- India + Pakistan
- Israel + Palestine
- Cyprus
My grandfather got severe PTSD peacekeeping in syprus with the PPCLI
(Princess Patricia Canadian Light Infantry)
The problem is that some random British guy who went to India once was charged with drawing a border that separated millions
He couldn’t have done a worse job if he tried
I don’t blame him though, he was pressured by the government
The colonial administration wanted to get out of India as soon as possible because it was bleeding them dry
And this is why the Canada/USA border needs to stay closed for the foreseeable future
We're going to Georgia later next month, they have the largest aquarium in the world 'Georgia Aquarium'. Even have whale sharks, only place outside of Asia to have them I believe
Georgia the country reminds me of Columbia
stunning but damn so many endless problems
They both *could* become great countries in their own right, tourism alone but the powers that be won't allow it
especially foreign powers
If it makes you feel any better, [we're under a heavy snowfall warning here in Nova Scotia
But when they venture into the world at large, oh boy does that change
Everyone everywhere does this
Humans love to complain about the weather
You get used to it
But it's miserable and sticky
But keep in mind these places have great A/C.
probably because of how dumb it is that you can post a picture of Yerevan, but not Ankara
So why does Kazakhstan not fall under these special rules
So are Copts, Lebanese + Syrian Christians all also Europeans
Sad to see so many masses marching for death
I can't imagine the waterfalls that were briefly created at Gibraltar and in the Bosphorus when sea levels rose
It looks like Denmark was literally just shifted north next to Scotland
Or that could be a strange little Michigan
But is the best solution to bury them in some dark hole where that individual will feel more like an outcast, likely run into other such individuals, and perhaps do something terrible

Can someone explain to me how Turkey legalized relationships in 1858 even though they weren’t founded till after WW1
Did some of the laws of the Ottomans just carry over to their territory’s when they dissolved, or am I just stupid and missing a larger picture
For me, I just can’t see the Ottomans legalizing Homosexuality, but could be wrong
Wow, I didn't realize the French revolution did that
Seeing a lot of uhh
"displeasure" towards Merkel yet I'm unfamiliar with why people feel this way
I was under the impression she was a decent Chancellor so can someone elaborate on why people aren't impressed with her

Those are compression stockings (for varicose veins and other medical conditions)
So he has to wear them hiking if he has shorts on or pants on, and it's a lot cooler to wear them with shorts
I have varicose veins, and if I don't wear them after a couple hours of hiking they start to ache
They are super lame looking so I wear pants as much as possible but there is only so much you can take
The sheer amount of comments that can only tie this place to bad pop culture movies & video games is pretty disheartening

My first visit to Europe was to visit my parents when my father was stationed at the Canadian base in Baden
They casually mentioned that the nondescript little town they lived in had just had its 1000th birthday, making it around the same age as L'Anse Aux Meadows and therefore older than all European settlement in my whole continent
My mind was blown
A little while later I visited Rome and Paris (among other places) and what little mind I had left was further blown at the experience of seeing ruins twice that old
To make a long story short, one of my hobbies now is European history, and I have now seen Roman ruins in about a dozen cities
Means city of the monks iirc
Yeah, that's the one I knew
Stop
It's the poilce

I went around Poland during February 2 years ago and there was a ton of snow
How a bill becomes a law !

I read this as 1980 earlier
Is this representative of all/most hospitals in Romania, or is it an isolated incident
snow danger
A reason I started learning Finnish is its connection with Quenya
Nice theory, but vaara (=mountain) and vaara (=danger) have different etymology
Vaara for fell or mountain is a loan word from Sámi, related to vuori, whereas vaara for danger is from Swedish fara

I keep Latvia and Lithuania distinct by thinking of the number of letters they have

You do go faster in Europe
It's usually 100 km/h here, with the fastest road in Canada being 120 km/h. It's not unusual for all the traffic to be faster than the limit, though
But don't cross the street before Ampelmann says so

This has the same energy as the "Portugal is not a small country" propaganda map
Any argument you have against Britain leaving the EU is an even better argument against Scotland leaving the UK
Man, I remember being on Reddit during the Scottish independence referendum in 2014
Seemed like there were so many Americans on here that were cheering it on, saying things like "1776 was our year and 2014 will be yours
" Like wtf it has nothing to do with you
As a Canadian though, I think I have natural aversion to these things
I imagine the reason is to make sure the message is clear to as many people as possible because there are a lot of super stupid people who would interpret things the wrong way and start a shitstorm over it
I think there is some truth to your point of some people wanting to see the UK suffer just because
Especially after Brexit, which I think many on here were against and who viewed it as a slight against them once it happened
Yeah and I get that
If I were from the UK, I probably would have voted Remain but that is besides the point
My point is that, partially due to Brexit, many here on this site have opinions regarding the UK that are, shall we say, overly emotional
And I think some here want to see the UK fail simply for the schadenfreude
Wait, so I have your silly old queen as head of state in Canada, but she isn't the head of state a couple of miles down the M5

This sort of thing defintly happens among different English speakers
The British are the masters of not saying what they mean, and that can mess with Americans and Canadians as well
The main one that comes mind is that British people will often say hello by saying something like "you alright
". They're not actually enquiring about how you are, you're just expected to respond fine or can't complain
When I moved to Canada I realised how often I did this, because a few Canadians were confused and assumed that I was implying something was wrong because I was asking them if they were alright
That sounds more like what Brits mean than, say, Aussies
(Am I right
Is Canada basically Dutch
I say all the things on the left but actually mean all the things on the right
You are thinking about it wrong
It's not a question, it's a verbal handshake
A ritual to show the other person that you are aware of them and paying attention
Just like it's rude to ignore a handshake, it's rude not to reply with "how are you" back
Also, Americans don't ask the cashier how they are doing every time
It depends on the state, and the american
Many people basically ignore the cashier

That is awesome
To be fair US President Barack Obama was hated for saying his opinion about Brexit, that EU should stay united and that he was against the UK leaving, and actually made a threat that the UK would be at the back of the line
It's kinda funny
Even though he was an ardent Marxist and an anti-imperialist, his dystopia still involved Britain losing its Empire and Superpower status before becoming a subordinate partner to America
Wow it looks remarkably like the USA electoral map
Fringes all blue, center all red
Kind of embarrassing/ironic if that's the conclusion r/europe is pulling from this abysmal graphic considering the population is probably higher in the blue explaining the economic and book sold discrepancy plus the fact that a difference in 2% might as well be a rounding error
Mostly people who voted No never gave a fuck about the people who voted Yes and now they are paying the price
The same happened in the US and will happen in every place where a big part of the country is left alone to fend for itself
Yeah
How'd that go for you Russia
Ah yes
I'm sure whining about it will stop it from happening
You can see the labeling all over this thread

EEA allows free movement of people
It was the UK that rejected it
You motherfucker
I completely agree that people really didn't even understand how most of the EU worked
And a lot of leavers were saying "we will be like norway" when Norway in fact had freedom of movement too
It's kinda nutty that there was a referendum that didn't even ask what kind of brexit people wanted
No worries
Also I do think a lot of people or at least some did vote thinking a Norway type deal would be involved
Italy are the same with Parmigiano-Reggiano charts
Basically fuck french sovereignty
I perfer the tomato or potato Europe
Yeah, and I realize I'm probably being anglocentric here, but I don't think I'd ever have a use for a term that means "UK, Ireland, Netherlands, Belgium, and parts of France". Even if you tweaked the boundaries a bit, it still seems like a pretty arbitrary chunk of Europe to talk about as a unit, so I'm having trouble seeing how this is supposed to be useful
Pretty sure the UN also classifies Britain and Ireland as Northern Europe though, doesn’t it
I know eh

Not quite a blanket company
They were the company responsible for a large chunk of the fur trade and now they have department stores
Blanket company
Huh
Do you know what the HBC was
It owned the majority of land in Canada for a while and dealt in furs
Not sure what you mean by “blanket company”
No clue what he means by “blanket company”. The HBC actually acted as a de facto government in the parts of Canada that they owned (which, until 1869, was a lot of land)
Ah, I see

Could it be
such a shame every city in the world is becoming so ugly
Ugly, but looks better than the rest of Poland
>Did you forget Warsaw was bombed to smithereens
This argument falls apart because it essentially validates the idea that all new cities, and all new developments MUST fall into the uniform global style, rather than reflect any kind of new developments along local cultural identity
Why is it Poles could build cultural buildings prior to WW2, but not today
Except that when Warsaw was rebuilt following the Deluge, I'm willing to bet the city still looked distinctly Polish, and not like a piece of Shanghai
Not even slightly diverse in comparison
Only a few metropolitan areas of Canada are diverse
The rest of the country is quite uniform
Calgary and Edmonton are majority white by far
That's 3 million people
Toronto proper has a population of 2 (and change) million people
The greater toronto area has much lower percentage of visible minorities than Toronto's %52
The Total percentage of visible minorities in Canada is roughly %23

I am sorry but *America* clearly produces superior chocolate
I didn't even know the Swiss made chocolate
Holy shit, 1852
Thankfully the Swiss have little to do with it
I don’t really agree with this statement, and maybe it’s because I’m an outsider, but hear me out, because many of the most influential and passionate Finnish language and culture proponents of the nineteenth century who played key roles in the development of Finland and its culture were Finland Swedes by upbringing and origin
Snellman, Lönnrot, Aleksis Kivi (born Alexis Stenvall), Akseli Galen-Kallela (born Axel Waldemar Gallén), and Zachris Topelius to name just a few, among others
All huge names in Finnish history and culture
Unless of course you’re referring only to Swedes as those from Sweden, and not including Finland Swedes in the mix
Sorry if I am misinterpreting or misunderstanding
My girlfriend is Fennoswedish and lived in Sweden for some time
She has said that the general knowledge of Finnish, and even Finland Swedish, is shockingly abysmal in Sweden
She said once that she’d even met people who heard her speaking Finland Swedish — not Finnish — who’d assumed *that* was Finnish
We visited Tallinn and made our way to Helsinki via the ferry
Tallinn was a surprisingly great beer city
Happy independence day from Canada

This comment is going to get lost but the 'Unknown Soldier' book really has me reminiscing
I'm Canadian and worked with a Finnish woman who was absolutely lovely
There's something about cultures that are polar opposites of one another that's sort of hilarious to try and work through
Anyway, whenever I meet someone from a culture I'm unfamiliar with, I always ask for a book that encapsulates the country, or a book that every citizen of that country is familiar with
Something interesting I can bring up in the future aside from the most overdone sterotypes, ya know
She recommended that I read Väinö Linna's Unknown Soldier- not only was it a fantastic read, I think it's a great representation of the Finnish spirit
The few Finns I have met since (there aren't many of you over here
) have really gotten a kick out of it when I bring it up
But seriously thank you for the lovely art, and cheers to your lovely country and people

OP that username is amazing gotta say
Eliminate Russia and you've got an EU party going
England technically still in

now that the Finns were brought up
why do they suck at the game, relative to their Scandinavian peers

We have a strikingly similar one in [Toronto]
The Irish moved to Canada in large numbers, a lot of them settled what is still today known as "cabbage town" just to the east of downtown, named that because the stodgy white folks disdain for the smell of boiled cabbage
It’s mainly due to how birth rates nowadays are very low in first world countries

The real story is how well Africa is coming along
Has that been with a lot of external investment from China and the West, or is it largely domestic
And then there's the Middle East saying: "LOL, we'll just turn up our air conditioners more".
We had 40s here in Canada
And people say global warming isn’t real
It felt like 40 yesterday and will feel like 36 tomorrow, assuming I'm alive to see it
Time to move to Galicia
Central southern Canada has always had terribly hot humid summers
Now they're even hotter
It's definitely even hotter now
But even as a child I remember summers where it was 35+ for days with unbearable humidity
Cost of electricity is a huge factor
Power costs in North America run from like €0
03 to 0
15 per kWh
It's something like €0
10 - 0
50 in Europe
It's basically 10x as expensive to run an air conditioner in Germany compared to Canada
Nuclear weapons have far more to do with this than the EU
Don't want the job to be too peaceful mind you
As a Canadian I hope everybody stays safe except for the terrorists
They need to be caught and shamed in court

You're correct
Too many people have died thanks to this bullshit secular fantasy that 'everyone shares our values'.
Denying an anti-enlightenment religion & *ideology* from having a place in western civilization is absolutely not a position of hatred
The world is a little brighter today
Love you Finns <3
Tolkien based one of his elvish languages on Finnish, so it's more like the Elves are speaking Finnish, rather than vice versa
Bit awkward with the other big voice in Europe, Germany, shutting all their nuclear power plants down
F R  N C E
Good
THANK YOU FRANCE
Why is Europe so afraid of nuclear energy
The best time to plant a tree is 10 years ago
The second best is today
It absolutely is all that
Unfortunately, the public perception of nuclear is all death and destruction
That's despite events like Chernobyl being the result of a lot of human error
People also get scared of radiation, for some reason
Sure, storing the waste is a problem sometimes, but the power plants don't kill anyone
Honestly, it's frustrating
Fair
I do believe, however, that we have the technology to eliminate many of the problems reactors faced in the past
We can create power plants that are smaller and more efficient in regards to nuclear waste
Though the investments needed to do better are lost to fear
I think this is a fair point
Where the waste goes is less of a problem for us in Canada, but I suppose Germany would struggle storing it without many places for the stuff to go
However, I still believe improvements in technology can allow for much more efficient reactors which don't lead to nearly as much waste
Modern designs can continuously keep using spent fuel for a long time
The waste issue isn't an impossible obstacle to overcome, and nuclear is still much more preferable to the coal taking its place
We need to give innovation a chance if it means doing good for the environment in the long term
Beautiful place

He was dead by the time the cameras were rolling
Really funny considering Poland and Lithuania were the last of Europe to be converted to Christianity
Meanwhile in Poland, the Catholic Church helped preserve Polish national identity while under occupation by the Russians and Prussians, and more recently it also played a major roll in the fall of communist one-party rule in Poland
Very different legacies

(canada invented this pizza topping)
I'm outraged
As Canadian-Asian who considers Hawaiian style pizza one of the best topping combinations to exist, I find this statement to be extremely discriminatory
I want my MP's to propose an Anti-Pineapplephobia legislation
Or I will riot
If you do no allow me to have pineapple and ham on my pizza you are a racist and a Nazi
Did ya know Hawaiian pizza was invented in Canada
The more you know
Who knew that Iceland would emerge as the Voice of Reason in this crazy world
Pineapple is fruit
You don't put fruit on pizza

Which tool was used for this ? I've seen like 2 posts using this and I'd like to overlay this as well over Canada for perspective
Hahah I know right
Brexiters are immune to Coronavirus
As are Fox News viewers
I was just permanently banned on r/worldnews for implying the entire family should be deported if the police probe finds out that they were all aware that the father was going to do this
If the young student was the one who reported it to his father, then he obviously thought it was something terrible and worthy of punishment
That doesn't necessarily imply the rest of the family knew and didn't try to stop him - but I wouldn't at all be surprised if that was the case, considering the environment this kid must be living in to report to his father that a cartoon of Mohammed was shown (gasp
) and then be ok with his father decapitating his teacher for it
I'm not sure how young this kid was, but obviously he was being raised in a violent and extremist environment, and I can only speculate what the rest of the family thinks
Regardless, this is absolutely horrific, and fucking disgusting
Man when Pete Hoekstra ran for a US Senate seat in Michigan, he posted this ad against the incumbent
I think that says quite a lot about who this racist is
I often wonder how long it will take for the rest of the world to take the United States seriously again once this freak show is over
You should come to Canada if you think that's special
Ours is the same with some sort of apology so people can saw "aw so Canadian

Looks like fascism has returned all over europe for the first time in over 70 years
Today the EU has shown itself to be a fascistic luddite organization with no reason to exist
Amazingly this is going to affect American businesses, which everyone here relies on such as Reddit that heavily uses links to stay afloat

If this were happening in the US EVERY one of you would be saying how shitty it is, how grateful you are to live in the EU as they'd never be so insane to pass such a law
Yet it looks like SOPA is dead in the water still while this has passed with extremely little resistance from European citizens

"Muh freedoms" also includes keeping the internet as is, meanwhile vastly superior EU tries to reign it in while having imbeciles blindly support it at every turn

>I want the EU to take more of the migrants from Italy, also i'd like everyone to meet me new friend Orban who doesn't want any migrants from Italy
>There's really no winning against all the mental gymnastics you guys are able to make
Mental gymnastics
It's pretty clear cut logic that Salvini's alliance goes against the goals he says he is for
Salvini wants EU quotas for migrants
The EU wants EU quotas for migrants
Orban does not want EU quotas for migrants
Salvini and Orban form an alliance
By allying with Orban, Salvini is a hypocrite going against what he claims to want
It makes it clear that all he really wants is not the EU to share the burden of migrants but instead to have an anti EU rhetoric even when they are in favour of what he asked for in the first place
If anything Salvini would have more credibility if he sided with EU on the issue since it's what he was fucking demanding like two months ago
This is like when Mitch McConnell filibustered himself in the States
Sorry to pop your bubble, but yeah that’s probably not happening
If anything, AfD is likely rising
A 13% decrease in CDU is a big stretch though
And if you’re polling only 1500 people with six options, of course you’re going to get a disproportionate result
I’m betting that green won’t rise higher than 14%, and cdu falling no more than 9
Tbh this poll shows every party except green and FDP falling
you have to wonder what the pollsters’ motive is
Probably isn’t happening for real though
This poll is the ONLY one that shows greens in the lead
This poll is likely being used solely to influence the public, and it’s obviously working

I hate seeing berries here in Canada
They're so expensive so people don't buy them much and they go bad on the shelves (moldy)
Just knock a bit off the price and you'll make up for the waste and thensome
I used to work at a supermarket and it was truly saddening the amount of product I had to throw away
Specifically anything dairy, I blame it on the consumer since they figured that most recent product sits at the back of the shelf they would go out of their way to reach said product, when there was clearly other stuff at the front that had plenty of shelf time
Eventually that’s how a lot of stuff ends up being thrown away
But people going hungry has been around for 10000 years
People throwing food away is a new concept and yes the other guy is correct: we can afford to do that now in certain places

Hence the old joke that the two greatest successes of Austrian diplomacy were to convince the world that Mozart was Austrian and that Hitler was German
is it common for these 4:3 films to have that red curtain letterboxes
That is an interesting number to think about but "literally half" is incorrect
Using /u/gxgx55's simple example:
> Each person knows some amount of other people, let's mark the average amount of people known as K, whatever the number might be
Then that means, on average, the amount of people that are separated by 3 degrees from you will be K^3 , while 6 degrees would be K^6 . K would have to be ridiculously low for what you said to be true
If K = 44, for example, then the fraction of people within 3 degrees of separation versus 6 degrees of separation would be approximately K^3 / K^6 = K^-3 ≈ 0

Been used as part of the french immersion program in Canada for many decades
Although the Cleopatra film has its qualities:
* Monica Anna Maria Bellucci in various states of undress
By the gods that woman
* (For the french version) [It has one of the greatest improvised monologues about nothing ever put to film] by the Scribe Otis (literally translates to Autistic)
The actor beside him almost blew it because he was going bonkers trying not to laugh
Apparently the amount of improv
in that particular movie made the A&O creators go ballistic and they swore to never allow an other movie unless they had full control of its production
Ergo, It's all downhill after Cleopatra
The puns
* Asterix (*),
* [Obelix] ,
* [Panoramix]
* Cétautomatix (It's automatic -> "C'est automatique"),
* Abraracourcix (with a lot of strength, violently -> "à bras raccourcis"),
* Assurancetourix (full coverage insurance -> "Assurance tout risque"),
* Agecanonix (The official age -> "L'age canon"),
* Ordralfabétix (Alphabetical order -> "Ordre alphabétique")

Of course we all use words differently and they change over time
In Canada our left leaning Federal and Provincial party, The New Democratic Party, successfully voted to ban the use of the word socialism from its constitution (2011
Even though they are directly descended from the democratic socialist tradition
I understand we use the word Liberal very differently then Americans, here it means limited government and individualist, ie freedom of
market, trade, speech, religion, press, etcetera
In America it was for a time a word so left leaning as to be synonymous with communist or at least big government, a dirty word
(and it is interesting to note how many large government expansions were actualy by the GOP)
Our right-wing conservatives we used to call them Tories or even red Tories, a word that directly seems to descend from outlaw, or highwayman; is now chiefly concerned with fiscal conservatism and economic liberalism, my how things change
or stay the same
The US might look at us as socialists, increasingly I think Canadians see the USA as a Kleptocracy
Perhaps some Americans do as well
It's always a bit surprising when I realise how little some Americans know about Canada
This hurts my brain
Eh eh time to kill queen Elizabeth sorry aboot that
Living in Canada is like living in a quaint apartment above a crack house
Slowly the insanity is starting to come up the stairs, but I have confidence that we won’t go all the way crazy
Ah yes the UCSP, Union of Canadian Socialist Provinces
North Korea must be pissed at being overlooked
I mean, what's a dude gotta do to get *Noticed*?? At least more noticed than freakin *Canada*!!!
I'm glad its less than 50% of people at least
Canada
China is really the only one that’s socialist
Venezuela is just a complete disaster
Then you have Scandinavia, Canada France and Germany
They are not socialist, we just have good social services
Meaning, the government cares about its citizens
Reminds me of a documentary I watched on YouTube the other month called *Sweden: Lessons for America* by a Swedish journalist
In it, he covers the myth that Sweden is socialist, and then immediately breaks down how it absolutely isn’t, and how it’s a free market economy in which the working and middle classes actually pay more in taxes (proportionally) than the multi-millionaire and billionaire classes
This is, of course, exactly how it works in the United States too
There's a distintio
Sanders is a full blown communist, his political history makes that pretty clear
That said, his platform during the primaries definitely weren't mostly because he's smart enough to know that americans would never stomache a leap like that and pretty sure marxist communism require socialism first anyways
I'm from the UK originally, so from my perspective things are going much better in Canada than they are back home
I do agree that Canada could be doing better in many areas, but i also think that's true of most places
Now it's time to get the ol' boys back together as the Anglosphere Union:
United Kingdom + Canada + Australia + New Zealand
Couldn't the UK just resign from the Union but become part of EFTA, like Norway and Switzerland are
Or am I missing something
To be fair, I didn't explicitly specify free movement of people and should have been more clear with what I meant, but anyway having it between the aforementioned countries and South Africa (and others) would not be a good idea
I'm always struck but the gratitude that most Dutch people still show for the liberation from the Nazis
It's very classy and considerate
AKTUALLY he though it was the east indies (ie malaysia) which is why they're called the west indies now
Is it chad to not commit genocide

Well than that's a-okay
They're just scared of Europe's potential
Look at that raw power
When I see photos like this I often wonder what percentage of those homes are occupied by locals, and what percentage by tourists
IIRC there's an old COD map named Santorini
A little sloppy with coastlines, but great borders
Then again, you only spent 4 hours on this lol
Finland also exports hockey goalies to Canada and the states ;)
They're huge in the city where I grew up in Canada too, because of the large Polish population
Even though USA isn't the fattest country anymore for some time
So Trump has no idea what he's talking about, you say
Is anyone here surprised about this
So why exactly do we pay any attention to him
yeah, that president thing
If it could lead to more trade between every other countries and improve every economy in the world (while bringing the US' down closer to the average, and it would probably still be very good), I'd be happy about it, but I'm not holding my breath
Yet PiS keeps winning :(

Canadian here, what is this
Too hilly
Do you think they could flatten it out a bit
Saw this was marked OC and knew it was posted weeks ago
It was you
Surprised nobody except one guy reposted it so far
Lyrics start with "Du

Du hast Mich
(You

You have asked me
Joke is that usually when you just see the word "Du" on its own, people will usually reply continuing the song like such

Irony would suggest that United is also an Oil State-backed club run by modern day slavers

GO TO YOUR ROOM AND THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU DID
How exactly did they come up with that number
The article makes no hint
Not with the constant streams of tourists day and night
How did [Bobo] get involved in this
Wehraboos are salivating at the thought
Gravitas is the wrong word here, since it means dignity and splendor
I would suggest just "gravity" since that has a much darker tone

Gotta give the WBC some credit - at least they aren't violent
I agree with your point though
I think you mean "bleep the bleep test"
Someone should nudge the UK and let them know it’s not the 19th century anymore
They aren’t the big boy at the negotiating table and every time one of their politicians act like the EU won’t negotiate in good faith it makes their entire country look utterly moronic
UK: “What do you mean we can’t have the benefits of the EU without contributing to the EU
If you don’t give us what we want, we’ll leave
EU: “You’ve already committed to leaving
You have no leverage
UK: “We’ll leave
They would have to put up some kind of a hard border, but the border between Scotland and England is actually must easier to manage than the Irish border
It's shorter and has fewer small country roads weaving across the border
Happy birthday fish shaped country

I might need to figure out a "work from home" arrangement in Italy

Germany - [poison eggs in twelve states - "No all-clear"]
In more and more federal states, eggs are found which are contaminated with the plant protection product Fipronil
The discounter chain Aldi now takes all the eggs from the sale
Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but chickens in Europe are also vaccinated for many diseases such as Salmonella, and that makes a big difference
It's not though
Why is the German tourist not digging a hole
Given all the happenings in Sweden recently, I think a Chinese tourist would have been a nice addition here
>Do other Europeans have the Lederhose stereotype about Germans
Would you prefer other German stereotypes
I like how the mountain goes all the way up into the clouds so you cannot even see the peaks

I'm actually surprised the UK is in fact at the top of this list
"what's a samareeno
no we are not, any of those youngsters would spit on the british flag any day if it meant albania has something to win over it
Canada is still technically speaking under the crown, so yes i am an albanian subject of the queen
how many muslims do you know that run an orphan house in the west
Never said i do not consider myself Canadian
All i said is that 99% of Albanians would spit on the country that welcomed them, if their country of origin has something to win
And this is true with every immigrants, not Albanians alone
She is the queen of the commonwealth, which includes both Canada and Britain
Do you live in romania
because i clearly said the west
Yes and she is the queen of both simultaneously
Her not staying in Canada right now doesn't remove her right of being the queen
Never said i was British lmao
All i said was that i am an Albanian subject of the queen
I remember one time I was in vilnius and I met a very stoic Swede
We were hanging out with a bunch of people all night and he never laughed or smiled
At one point late in the night the fact that Danes couldn't speak Danish came up and I remember seeing this video years before
So I brought it up and showed him, never seen such a hearty chuckle in my life
Best night ever

This should be in Life Pro Tips
[My favourite constructed language called Occidental] was born there (the creator was a Baltic German who lived his whole life and died there too) starting with a publication called Kosmoglott that took its name from an interlinguistic society, the first in Imperial Russia, that produced a whole bunch of projects including a spinoff of [Volapük] called [Idiom Neutral] I'm not surprised at all that general literacy was also through the roof
Thanks
Norway  is definitely higher in my books now
(move over, Denmark )
Now there will be at least one Canadian who does too
Also, how do I put a country beside my name like you‘ve done
Takk så mye
As a Canadian I still consider America to be our closest and most reliable friend and our largest ally
1 man is not going to change that despite his best effort
Its their national sport it seems
I assume that was the amount of people who voted for Trump
I bet the vast majority of them would say they have no issues with Canada and still consider us friends and allies
There are Americans on both sides of the isle that would like to see the friendship ended just as there are Canadians of all political leanings who feel the same American our relationship with the US
Its not just on American dairy, its on dairy from every country thats not Canada
The reason for it is to prevent having to directly subsidize Canadian dairy farmers
I live in Canada now and it's a huge problem here
I get between 1 and 5 of these calls a day, and a lot of them are spoofed to look like they come from a local number
I just don't answer my phone anymore if I don't recognize the number
Do not call lists don't really work because fraudulent telemarketers are operating outside of your jurisdictions and hiding behind SIP trunks with false telephone numbers
Despite having subscribed many times to the Canadian do not call list, during tax time I get frequent fraudulent phone calls claiming to be from the tax authority
The majority of these calls originate from India for the most part and use text-to-speech software to fake the authority of the call
Last year [there was some action on India's] part, but the calls continue nevertheless
I find this phenomenon to be rather tiresome
« But sir why would be speaking Dutch to you
You live in the Netherlands, not Germany ».
Even when not moving, where I live (Eastern Canada), we have more than 60° C of difference between the colder day of winter and the hottest day of summer (some years we reach 70° C of difference)
Some days the temperature can jump over 20° C in a single day (either up or down)
The same 10° C causes complaints both because it's too cold (in fall) and too hot (in spring)
Over a few weeks/months, the body adapts to a certain temperature and a too high variation will feel uncomfortable
Not sure if art or /r/maliciouscompliance or /r/notmyjob
Oh at least that's great for people like me who just want to sit on the other side without getting sand on their shoes

I will always remember my first trip to unified Berlin just a couple of years after this
It was all a little surreal after growing up thinking of East Berlin as the epicenter of our enemy, and included one of the best nights I only partially remember hopping nightclub/squats with my (fortunately German-speaking) brother
Happy (re-) Birthday, Germany
I owe you a visit as soon as its practical
A sorbian maybe idk
I heard it used mostly in "fulgi de nea", which is more common than "fulgi de zapada" (at least in Northern Moldova, where I'm from)
