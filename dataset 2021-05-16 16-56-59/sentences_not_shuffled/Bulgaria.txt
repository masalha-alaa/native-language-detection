The mass exodus of Turks
In an attempt for our government to "unite" the nation in 1984 they forced all Bulgarian Turks (total about 10% of Bulgarian population) to change their names to Bulgarian-sounding one, they forbid traditional clothing and public muslim rituals
Imagine your government *forcing you to change your own name you've had all your life*. Of course, as a direct result many Bulgarian Turks  left en masse - about 300 000 (out of 800 000) left for Turkey
Maybe half of them returned later but those are impossible to estimate correctly
It was a human rights and a demographic catastrophe
Bulgaria is known to have saved its jews in WWII
However it is not often said that the Macedonian jews didn't have such luck and those who were saved were stripped of their properties and money
here in bulgaria we treat turkish immigrants like animals
> Do Turks in Bulgaria now have all Bulgarian names
No, they were allowed to change them back after communism fell
Most of them did
They make a remembrance of those events every year as far as I know
yeah but i dont get why were still pissed bout the ottomans, turks and ottomans are very didferent and there is no point in shaming the turks coz of their ancestors
My flair
No hard feeling towards any neighbor, but I love warm, salty seas
At first look Greece is a good pick, as this gives a lot of Mediterranean shore, but going for Turkey will make the whole Black sea part of the Mediterranean, besides the additional seashore
Now I notice that the title says EU, so Greece after all, maybe
Stay away from the Balkans MF
Not on EU, but nevertheless this will have profound effects on global politics, climate and what not
Unless it's only the European part, in which case it's will still have huge impact on global politics, but no so much on global climate (maybe)
That's actually interesting question for geography nuts - what is the impact on global climate if some country were water - Russia being the largest by a hefty margin would probably have the biggest impact
just swim l0l
I thought that's the point of what ifs
Don't know about first, but we do have the most free paid days for mothers that just went out of labour successfully
Something like two years
In Bulgaria mothers are the most important
I remember reading that we used to have some of the best maternity leave in the world - two years paid, first year paid in full
I think they changed this to only one year now but I still think that's pretty good, especially comparing to some more developed countries than only offer a few weeks at best
Booking flights to Switzerland
Didn't you guys have some more really good early social laws
Something about female equality I think
Completely forgot what it was
Idk, it's not that easy, otherwise I would apply this picosecond for it
That's almost like a primitive UBI
Nice
Someone else said Portugal was first idk
No, this is just a fun thread on reddit
Why are so many Germans going politically to the right
Try some suicidal depression and tell me then if you still think that way about physically healthy people with depression wanting euthanasia
Legalised euthanasia
In the Netherlands
Where
And how do I sign up
Bolsheviks or the other parties
Wasn't 1920 before the purges
You still had mensheviks and socialist revolutionaries (the actual people that caused the Russian revolution)
I thought Bolsheviks were only in power from the civil war onwards
I didn't know this 100 bucks was to replace parent leave
7 months only
That's insane
I don't understand this, the baby needs a parent during these crucial developing first two years
So sad we have to sacrifice this to make a profit for some company
Een volk een rijk
It's easy to understand, listen
Imagine being in a wheelchair for reasons out of your control
Wouldn't you want to be able to do most things other people can do
Easy access to buildings for example
Wouldn't it be good if those that can walk give 0
0000001% of their tax so you can be normal
Now imagine you're born with a gash between your legs that bleeds every month
Regardless of your income, it's out of your control
So a man perfectly equal to you in every other way pays a certain amount less than you and gains an undeserved benefit over you
Why am I asking that
The rest of the world hasn't forgotten Germanies past
We love you guys now, but we're keeping an eye on you just in case :P
Thank you
Oh :(
Ah shit yeah, that's right
The bolshevik revolution of 1918 put the mensheviks and SR's in jail right
Oh well
Would be "een leider"
You already pay for that free access if we're talking about the wheelchairs
And my prior point I think you went out of your way to not understand it
Saying I'm equating women to handicapped people
And that that is insulting to women because
handicapped people eww
Has everybody lost their minds
What's with the hair by the way
Each country has one crazy haired blond person who's ready to fuck up the country
Trump and Boris have been successful at this
In the Netherlands we still have Geert Wilders, in France we still have Marine Le Pen and in Bulgaria we had Volen Siderov
They all have crazy blond hair
Bulgaria
starting the second Balkan war because they were not happy with what we got from the first Balkan war
And then losing everything we got from the first Balkan war
Yup
We were idiots
Sorry for what my ancestors did my Balkan brotha
An old grandfather lives in the middle of nowhere in a place that doesn’t even have a name
His granddaughter grew up poor in the 90s (no indoor plumbing in her early days) but her parents do alright now
Her grandfather still doesn’t have indoor plumbing, doesn’t drive a car
He is a subsistence farmer on a crumbling property and lives in 2 rooms
His pension is a joke
If he didn’t have family to help support him, he wouldn’t be able to pay his bills
His house is heated by a wood burning stove- electric heat is too expensive
He’s relatively healthy and has a family to help support him but has lived a hard life
He still works hard every day
Winters are the worst because he’s very isolated and gets completely cut off from the outside world
His son vows to buy a cheap 4x4 to be able to go up there and check on him
He refuses to live with them during the winters because he doesn’t want to be a burden
He’s one of the lucky ones because many people his age, both in the country and in the cities, have basically been abandoned by their family or have nobody left to care for them
Many villages disappear every year because the young people either go to the bigger cities or work abroad because there’s no money to be made in the villages and the elderly don’t usually live to a ripe old age
Bulgaria is a beautiful country and I admire the resilience and fortitude of the people here
They make everything last instead of replacing things when they break
Many people have “gardens” (Americans would call these farms since they’re not small) that yield lots of produce for the whole family
A lot of veg is pickled so it can be eaten in the winter months
These people know how to sustain themselves in tough times
Even though every home in the village has access to affordable fiber optic internet and almost everyone has a smartphone these days, people who are 40+ who remember life under communism do not rely on these things the same way the younger generations do
If our modern society were to fall apart tomorrow, these people would be prepared to handle it
I forget some words in Bulgarian that have a shorter or better sound in English
My office speaks in this weird Bulgaro-Franco-English mix it’s hard sometimes
With 100% confidence i can say im better at english than bulgarian
I hate "Natasha and Boris accent" and can't help but judge people who have it
I like mine though, it's not typical Russian accent, usually people think that I'm somewhere from northern/central Europe
The thing that I hate about how I speak is that I make typical Russian mistakes - for example, I still mix up a/the a lot
Hell yeah
Having a hard slavic accent is so comfortable for me to speak and I believe it sounds cooler rather than trying to fake a British accent which kinda makes me choke and spit
The Dutch have hands down the worst English accent
Because of it and the cool "Russian" connotation our accent has I don't feel too bad about ours
I don't like it honestly, sometimes i have to repeat multiple times for native english speakers to understand me and it really hurts my dignity
Well I've lived half of my life abroad, so my accent doesn't sound anything like the eastern European one
In Russian there are no such concept as articles or anything even remotely similar
So for me it's very foreign thing - I know basic rule but I have zero inner feeling of the concept
I was considering getting an iPhone
The same model was overpriced by about 400 euros in our local Apple store
It literally costs *thousands* of leva (our currency), more than an average salary, by far
The last part is always the most important
Damn everybody comparing their cities to Detroit
Didn't know the home of D12 was that bad
I loved my three years in Glasgow
Wouldn't live there forever but that applies for the whole of UK
If I have to though - I'll definitely choose Scotland and possibly Glasgow again
If the choice was between Malmö and Stockholm or Gothenburg that is an easy one, don't go one of the latter two
But if it is to go or not to go, then go
I lived there for an year and a half and I have to say there are some things to see, it is by the sea which gives bonus points and I like the general calmness that the city brings to it's citizens
And sorry to say it, don't bash me with stones, Swedes, but Copenhagen is 20 minutes with a train so that's a huge plus, because Copenhagen is gorgeous
Edit: missing word
Probably the stereotypical average office worker who is never satisfied and is always looking at their options, trying to get the most out of every interested party
"Oh, the EU office gives me good benefits, but look, the Russian office has a great deal from me if only I put in a good word for them at the next staff meeting
And, hey, the China office does some amazing work if only I let one or two little (big) companies be bought by them
Oh, look, that nice Greek colleague has some problems with the Turkish office, I think I'll cozy up to the Turkish office in order to not let any problems fuck up my desk, morals be damned
Wait, what
The EU office is giving more benefits
I DEMAND MORE BENEFITS
The guy that does nothing and almost no one talks to them, but he asks for money
We would be the IT department that everybody forgot existed
Edit: who inexplicably were also partially in charge of catering (very agrarian) and providing workers with
weapons
(we produce or used to produce a lot of weaponry)
The janitors / dustmen / dishwashers, the low-paid undesirable jobs
The guy who collects all the garbage
We work as the lousy security guard
Bulgaria
It's one month here
Yes, sure
That's like the norm
We shall call it Euro English (especially after Brexit)
A single coffee is like a liter and yet there's barely any coffee in it
More embezzling here
Apparently some random company nobody knows about that has a revenue of 500 euro got a loan of 30+ mil euro by the Bulgarian Development Bank
It got the media's attention though and the management has since been sacked
Yeah but this shit is normal by now
What would far-left mean in terms of Spanish affairs
Sorry if it's a bit ignorant
I mean, you guys are pretty good at it too
Real recognizes real and all that
Yep, we produce millions of masks, rubbing alcohol and other vital things right here at home
And yet, somehow we've decided not to use those and buy some from abroad, at a vastly higher price
Funny how that happens isn't it
"That'll show them not to be unfriendly to us
" - Russia probably
I see, thanks for the detailed explanation
Our traditions in the sport span the ages, but you guys really raised the bar high for modern times
Depends, if you go back long enough two sets of names emerge, the slavic ones and the Bulgar ones
Don't know too much about female names through the ages, but I'd expect Teodora, Irina, Maria, Elena, Miroslava, Dara (more specific to the Bulgars) to be among the more popular ones
The male list:
Bulgar:
Asparuh, Kubrat, Boris, Bayan, Izbul, Tervel, Omurtag, Altshek, Irnik, Sevar etc
(Some are still used today as a homage)
Slavic: Dobromir, Simeon, Momchil, Presiyan, Kaloyan, Mihail, Ivan, Petar
(By far the more popular nowadays)
Стоянка (Stoyanka), that's so 17th century for me
Bulgar names like Kubrat, Asparukh and Tervel
I also know a guy named Balik after a 14th century lord
Giorgiu
Basically any name that ends with iu
Bonus female names through the ages: Kera, Keta, Kossara, Maria, Paraskeva
Diminutive names: Petko/Petka, Stefko/Stefka, Penko/Penka, etc, are super popular amongst older people
What are 5 interesting things about your country
(Erasmus game)
This was a game we used to play on one of my Erasmus exchanges
It is really quick and easy and you can get a quick idea of other countries if you had none before, so that you feel closer to them
So, I will start with Bulgaria:
Bulgaria is the oldest country in Europe, which has never changed its name since its foundation in 681
Bulgarians invented the Cyrillic alphabet in 893 during the 1st Bulgarian Empire
Bulgaria was the home of the Thracians, the Thracian hero Spartacus was born in present-day Bulgaria
Thus we consider ourselves a mixture of Bulgars, Thracians (they are the indigenous ones) and Slavic => Bulgarians
In Varna it was discovered the oldest golden treasure in the world, the Varna Necropolis, dating more than 6000 years back and we are 3rd in Europe with the most archaeological monuments/sites after Italy and Greece
We shake our heads for 'yes' and nod for 'no'.
Bonus: 'Tsar'/'Czar' is a Bulgarian title from the 10th century, derived from Caesar - Цезар (Tsezar) in Bulgarian
What are 5 interesting things about your countries
Interesting, I always wondered why San Marino exists lol
I also thought that Kinder is German, I mean makes sense since it is a German word
You had to name it Bambino :D
Mmm, Germans, French, Italians, Spanish, etc
I don't remember Croatians and Estonians in particular and also I was the only Bulgarian there
Yeah, but we didn't vanish from the earth during that time lol
It is still our history
We were also part of the Byzantine empire for around 150 years between the 1st and 2nd Bulgarian empires, that's why they are two empires
And still all this time from 681 until now the name was only Bulgaria and nothing else
No, a quick Google search would have answered your question
Cyril and Methodius, who were Byzatine monks invented the [Glagolitic alphabet] Their Bulgarian students invented the [Cyrillic alphabet] by a request of the Bulgarian Tsar [Simeon I the Great] because the Glagolitic looks like an alien script and no one understood it
The Cyrillic was created after the brothers already died and their Bulgarian students named the new alphabet in honor of their teacher Cyril
I feel like a saint in Reddit, educating people that these two are completely different alphabets
I don't know how many times I have answered this question
But they changed their name
It says that they were like a safe haven for monks from 301 because of persecution from the Roman Empire, but their constitution was written in 1600, thus making them an official sovereign country on that year
It is really uncertain what was their status from 301 to 1600
I imagine it something like Mount Athos in Greece which is also a safe haven for monks and it is administrated by themselves
Edit:
Evidence of the existence of a community on Mount Titano dates back to the [Middle Ages] That evidence comes from a monk named Eugippio, who reports in several documents going back to 511 that another monk lived here
In memory of the stonecutter, the land was renamed "Land of San Marino", and was changed to its present-day name, "Republic of San Marino".
The [Holy See] confirmed the independence of San Marino in 1631
Yup, they changed their name
The idea of what I wrote is that since the foundation of Bulgaria the name has always been Bulgaria and nothing else
This is not the case with San Marino since they changed their name from whatever was the original, probably [Monte Titano] which was more like a religious community rather than a real country until 1631
I did not say that Bulgaria is the oldest country in Europe but the oldest one which never changed its name and San Marino did that
Yeah, having the same identity and name, that's the whole point
Otherwise we would have changed the name if we lost our identity, wtf
If you want to convince me or the whole of Bulgaria that the 1st Bulgarian Empire from 681 has only the same name and nothing else in common with the present day, good look with that haha
It's funny how all of a sudden people having read practically nothing start judging other peoples' histories without knowing a damn thing about them
Try telling this to a Greek that Ancient Greece has nothing in common with modern Greece :)
The whole point of this post is to learn about other peoples' histories and fun facts, not to contradict historical facts with made up hypothesis of what a random person thinks vs facts
I haven't gone talking shit about the Netherlands, because I am not Dutch and I don't want to make a fool out of myself like you just did
Good night
Ah, ok it wasn't really clear what you were saying
Cyrillic is based predominantly on the Greek alphabet with some augmentations by the Glagolitic alphabet
To me personally it is entirely based on the Greek since it shares a lot of letters with it written exactly the same and only one letter from the Glagolitic Ш. The Glagolitic one, looks like the Georgian alphabet or an alien script
I don't understand anything from it and I can't see any other similar letters
Honestly, I don't even know why people are still talking about it since it was used only for 30 years in the 9th century before being replaced by the Cyrillic
Than what you said was even more stupid
Obviously they were not the same country
Before they were monarchies
Even 30 years ago when Bulgaria was a communist country, it is not the same country with the present day Bulgaria
That doesn't mean that they are 100 different Bulgarias
Are you 5
Same can be said for the Netherlands and every single country on earth who changes governments and their constitutions
'If the Netherlands became a republic tomorrow, it will not be the same country as before when it was a monarchy and all its history is lost, only the new republic Netherlands counts from tomorrow' This is what you sound like
Honestly idk what you are trying to say/prove and why you even started this stupid conversation
And why am I still answering you
I am not gonna answer anymore, cuz I am losing brain cells
Due to fake news currently a subset of the Bulgarian population believes that Bulgarian child protection services will steal their kids and send them to paedophile gay couples in Norway
What bullshit do your countrymen believe through fake news currently
I'm really getting tired of this shit about Norway here
On the bright side, it seems like people who believe this have become a laughing stock and are taken less seriously
Or at least they have more opposition than they did before, but maybe this is just my wishful thinking
But still a program for sexual education in a school in a bulgarian city got suspended a few days ago because one mother complained about it, even though her kid isn't enrolled in it and even though parents whose kids are actually in the program have nothing against it
Edit: That program was reinstated
Not about my country (since it's already mentioned) but there are legitimately far right people that believe Sweden is inundated with refugees and immigrants of Islamic persuasion who are so unruly that Sweden has turned into a "war zone" and that there are actual "no go zones" in various cities
It's easy to be fooled when you haven't been there (which is the case for all these Americans and Brits)
Funny thing is, they tried to do the same bullshit propaganda with the Netherlands
The USA ambassador to the Netherlands was saying there were no go zones in the Netherlands and that there were politicians being set on fire
That dude got absolutely annihilated by the Dutch press
It was gruesome to watch
Доживях да видя пост от българин тук, онзи ден срещнах българин в тотално рандъм съб. I feel connected
In Bulgaria homosexuality isn't accepted very good
Not extremely homophobic or something
Nobody has a problem as long as you are not messing with them
Part of the idea I think was to teach kids at very young age that they may be a boy or a girl and it pretty much doesn't matter biologically
As this is a very Christian country and family is very important a lot of people got angry af
I personally think that this stuff should be said at 16 and not 7
I don't think nobody has a problem with Norway but the news that were probably fake blew up
What
No way
Im from Bulgaria and Sex ED is normal, multiple parents complain because they're still homophobic communist pieces of shit but that doesn't change anything because Sex ED needs to be mandatory everywhere
Soros conspiracy is a classic over here
Ah yes, the age-old "Those dirty refugees are going to rape and abuse our women" despite the fact locals are fucking professionals at it, and no one bats an eyelash
That rhetoric goes beyond borders
Absolutely
Every scientist ever is a paid shill
Homosexuality was a mental disease in the 50s but they paid the scientists to get it out of the list of mental diseases
And don't get me started on the global warming - every climatologist ever is in the big green conspiracy backed by the green lobby
When you point out that the carbon lobby is way more rich and powerful, it doesn't really matter, they just change the subject
Ah yes,we had that too
I can speak only for Bulgarians
Obviously the weirdos who believe the conspiracy theories aren't fond of them very much, but there are no negative opinions in general
Bulgarians look up to all Western European countries
Specifically for Scandinavian countries, there is a sizable minority of people who are huge fans of their metal and mythology
Also some Bulgarians think that their norhern climate might be to much for our southern souls
And we kinda tend to group the 'Scandinavian countries' together
Will they also legalise euthanasia for the depressed
Because then I'm moving to Spain
Exactly
But more specifically they think that their kids will be taken away if they spank them (they really want to defend their "right" to hit their kids) or if their kid complains to someone that it's being abused and since according to them kids misunderstand and can't be trusted this will surely be the end of the "traditional Bulgarian family".
It all started when Bulgarian woman, living in Norway, got her kids taken away and turned into a massive conspiracy theory that the "eurogay" union/the liberal west is plotting to teach Bulgarian kids to be gay and steal them in order to give them to black gay couples
In a small city a while back people actually didn't let their kids to go to school out of fear
What pains me the most about this is that they paint child protective services as evil and side with every parent that got their kid taken away and that makes it harder to protect children who are actually being abused
Luckily, people seem to be coming to their senses or maybe the weirdos aren't as vocal anymore, which surprises me very much in a good way
There is hope, I guess
Btw, one conspiracy I believe in is that all of this outrage is fueled by Russian propaganda
0000001 because I'm moving to Spain then
Nah, we have it in Bulgaria, but I also have seen it in Italian forums, as well as half of the English-speaking ones - US, UK, Australia, etc
It's the go-to conspiracy
IDK what these people will do when he finally dies
Or if having a seizure
Starting from some level owning foreign language vice versa - some things thinking on foreign language and transate on own
I think on both languages equally easy but for translate from one on another need put effort because structure very different
Interesting, but for me it was surprisingly familiar and easy understand
Russians also so speak
Although in russian no rigid structure, can build sentence different ways and all they will be correct
Probably was very difficult transalte Yoda so he sounded wrong on russian
Yes, we won't even win one game in the qualifiers anyway
Ha, jokes on them, my country has no chance to qualify for the world cup anyways
The unthinkable has happened - our government actually took the correct measures in time
It did a halfway decent job
Wow
[EU citizens] Would you support a EU initiative for high speed rail network to reach Bulgaria and Greece
Okay, so, here's the thing: high speed rail is a staple in Western and increasingly - Central Europe, but there is still no high speed rail connection to Bulgaria and Greece
That makes them rather isolated than the wonderfully connected cities in the West and the North
Would you, as EU voters and tax payers, support a push for the construction of such, allowing the Easternmost territories of the continental EU to reach Budapest in 5 hours by land transport, rather than 13
A while ago, I've made this [fantasy map] but does it have to be fantasy, considering how much economical development and mobility it could bring for everyone
I am from Bulgaria and this rail network will be very efficient because we like to travel to Greece and other European contrys
I would use a train to Thessaloniki or Budapest
The distance (700km) is comparable to Paris - Nice or Paris - Barcelona
Yes
A train from Vienna to Istanbul via Beograd and Sofia and from Vienna to Athens via Beograd and Thessaloniki will be a good option
We were late to the party and we started with ADSLs and optics from the start :) Germany as an early adopter had an inherited infrastructure
I am waiting for this pandemic to finish to make my bucketlist and ride an ICE from Berlin to Frankfurt
Terminal 1 (if that's the one you mean) will be demolished soon
This is the new Terminal 3 they intend to build
The idea is to have the infrastructure built
A train from Germany to Greece will be economically inept
But a train from Greece to Hungary, Hungary to France or Romania to Czechia will allow thousands to travel faster
Off-course, if it turns out profitable to have combined auto-train + sleeper cars running from Germany to Greece, then the infrastructure will allow it
Not to mention that this will allow Thessaloniki to become the African entry port for shipping
That is already happening: Bulgaria is upgrading its main line from 65 to 160 kmh but it still has no high speed connection with its close countries like Romania and Hungary
Because these two are the furthest from being connected and they will be the last to be connected, if at all, unless the EU doesn’t make HSR a priority in the coming decades
In Netherlands you have HSR to neighbouring countries: Belgium, France, Germany, even England
Are they not effective, or are they only used to transport flowers and strawberries
No it shouldn't. Trains are far more efficient for passenger transport than buses, let alone a car
I was going to travel from Budapest to Prague with a night train before tha virus broke out
The night jets from Vienna are a big hit too, last time I checked
Exactly
It will improve local connections
ANy reasonable person would fly from Finland to Greece, but any reasonable person would take the train from Sofia to Bucharest if it was 2 hours rather than 7, as it is now
I would too
When I visited Berlin I was like a kid in a candy shop: I love trains and Berlin was like an overdose :D
The Rail Baltica is already under construction and it will link Helsinki (via ferry)
But it does: better and faster connections increase (economic) mobility
This increases GDP and EU budget contributions are based on GDP
The question is, would you as an EU citizen support an EU-wide initiative to stimulate the improvements of neighbouring member connections as the Benelux has - the option of fast, high speed/high capacity passenger+freight corridors
Far more eficient for X doesn't mean not efficiant for Y.
If you live in Hungary, you should've notices how used the rails are there
Sofia - Ruse is 6 hours
Ruse - Bucharest is an hour if there are no delays on the border
Top speed - 100kmh in a 15 km stretch in Moesia
The rest is on old lines, designed for speeds of 65 kmh and partially upgraded to 85-90kmh but that speed is only theoretical
Wuppertal's on my bucket list as well
If you think that is bad - the shortest travel time between Sofia and Silistra is 11 hours
Bulgaria
Might as well not try
Sometimes I wonder if my country actually exists or is just a fever dream
I do skip, and if there isn't a Bulgarian comment, I tend to post one
Don't worry, with the climate change you'll get harsher winters as well
It's a common misconception that the winters will now be nice and warm
Well, it could be the small-country-overwhelmed-by-huge-amount-of-tourists-from-bigger-different-place complex
Basically if your country is swarming with tourists with different culture (too direct Germans, too indirect Swiss) resentment is easy to develop, especially for people not having direct economic gains from said tourists (although probably all have some indirect ones)
It's happening in my country with some nationalities of tourists too, though I can't really tell you who's in vogue now and who not
(actually it's probably still the Britts that are the more unwanted tourists, us being marketed to them as a cheap place to booze up hasn't picked up the best of their clientelle)
I thought Maltesers are from Malta, but they are British
I was today years old when I found out that Disneyland Paris is not the OG
Me as well
Works well
As trash as the healthcare is in the Netherlands, it's still lightyears ahead of that third world country the US
It really depends on where you live
For example the tap water in Sofia is really good but the water in Plovdiv isn't and you have to drink bottled water, or you live in Pernik and have no water
Here it depends
Some people trust our tap water, some don't. When travelling, however, most people tend to avoid drinking tap water from the town they're visiting because the different minerals in the water will hurt their digestive system, apparently
It is very common to drink tap water
I use bottled water only for the coffee maker to avoid scale or when I go out and there is no drinking fountain nearby
Yup
Bulgaria has one of the finest tap water in Europe (because most cities have mountain springs close by
People still buy bottled water or fill up on mineral water at some springs because of the taste though
The tap water in Plovdiv is good in my opinion
That's what I've been drinking for the past 4-5 years
It also depends on where in Sofia one lives
My neighborhood, I've heard, gets its tap water from Iskur Dam, which can't match Vitosha spring water or water from the various mineral springs in and around the city
Then again, I haven't tasted my home's tap water for quite some time - I have been using a filtering pitcher for a few years now
Back in the first half of the 2010s I remember it wasn't too good but was still completely drinkable
Last year they had a drought and new pipes were layed from some other water source
It's now mostly a joke
Very often actually
There are some cases, where there is no coresponding word in my language of the english one
You have no idea how many times I have called Brasil 'Brasil' and not the Bulgarian Бразилия(Braziliya)
I sometimes even catch myself when I had done it and I am always like "shit I just said the name of the country in English" to the person I am speaking
Talk about Northern Macedonia
Just don't do it man
We talk shit constantly about our government BUT that does not mean you can join in, you can't.
Banitsa gang rise up
Not meme-wise that I've heard of but middle aged men act the same way they're just not memed about because it's seen as a stereotypical "woman" thing
But it isn't only women who do it
When men do it is just a guy getting angry and entitled for no reason but it isn't turned into a whole *thing*.
111 place in the world on index for free press
Lowest in the EU, at this point I'm no longer sad, just laughing
i was just about to say it, thanks for making it easier for me
Well the police beat up a  teen while hiding behind a wall so it isnt public but it was recorded anywas so this sparked a lot of negativity  ... and the prime minister is still full of shit with no dignity to resign
Besides thats its all good ( to all bulgarians seeing this please dont scold me if i told anything wrong lol im not in track with what happened to the kid)
The media is shutting down the information
They are saying that the protesters are bought by some mafia man, living his life in Dubai, when the truth is that many young people(18-30) are protesting for their future, my future, as well
We don't want to live in some random country far away from home
Media is also lying about the numbers of protesters
If you are not living in the capital city (where is the biggest protest against the PM, his cabinet and the General Prosecutor), it would hardly make impact on your day
The PM ran away for very "important" meetings in West Europe, instead of staying and going to the people,that  chose him and facing them and giving them explanation for his actions
Also nice nickname
You sound more Dutch then
What's the deal with childcare in Ireland
I have a colleague that landed a very comfy and well-paid job there, moved with family ...and a year or some later came back running
Turns out his wife was pregnant with twins and after some quick calculations prices for care were ridiculous according to him
Speeding on the highway is not an issue so it is resources spent on something that has no correlation with accidents
Not before, but we usually drink AFTER exams, mostly the major ones - 4th grade, 7th grade and 12th grade
Yep I remember those times in elementary school older kids would call the police and say that there is a bomb in the school so they don't do the test that day
Which is kinda stupid because that way they would know who had test on that day and find who was the caller
After that the whole school would be evacuated, the police comes with trained dogs and search for it but never found anything
They do ther best, bless their souls
Tom Hanks did a decent job in [Terminal]
Well, his wife is Half-Bulgarian, so he had his Father-in-Law to teach him :)
It's the Law, if I am not mistaken
The country is made up
The language isn’t xexxe
Not very bad (someone has asked me this before)
His Italian accent is VERY thick but his grammar is almost perfect
Yes
Not as much as a tradition but more as something you do in general here
Yes, at least in my region
It's just a simple "Добър ден" (have a nice day) or "здравейте" (hello)
Yes
Behind this tradition in our country stands our long history of being culturally connected with the nature
We believe that when we are in the mountain, we are equal, we are not part of the civilisation, in which (in the past) saying hello to the higher-standing people in terms of social postion was obligatory
In the mountains there were no social boundaries - rich said hello to the peasents and so did the peasants
Because we're equal in front of the face of mother nature
Today it's polite to say hello and it's almost a rule to do so
And the feeling is great, tbh
Not like in the city where we pass total strangers, remaining cold and not saying a word
tradition
"Tradition" на английски не значи само буквално "официална традиция" ;)
Имах в предвид че не е задължително като "Отидеш ли в планината не кажеш ли добър ден на хората 100 години лош късмет", имах предвид че е прието да поздравяваш хората и не в планините а принципно .
Да, не сме като Скандинавците :)
This is true for most of the USA but in Saint Louis (home of Budweiser) you can drink in the street no problem
You can even drink in the car here as long as you are not the driver
If you get pulled over by the cops and there are 4 people in the car and only 3 open drinks
it's no problem
Mardi Gras and St
Patrick's day here are basically massive outside college parties taking up whole neighborhoods with a parade
That company has made this city paradise for the alcohol enthusiast
Just wanted to share
I went to a sauna in Helsinki and it was so fun
I had been to saunas before but this was on a when different level
The secret to getting Finns to talk to you is to meet them in a sauna
Same thing happened here back then and it was the same guy dubbing seemingly every movie
Now we have the same five guys dubbing every movie/show instead
Весела Коледа!
"Bulgarian constant = basically anything which makes your result correct
Sep 17, 2012"
Well
that's interesting
Rofl, I guess we've expirted some construction workers your way too
That's hilarious because it's exactly how you get approved for government contracts in Bulgaria
I wonder about the origin of that because we have never had elections even with a regular majority - ever since communism fell
Maybe it refers to communist times
But then, literally every eastern bloc country had "Bulgarian majority" in elections
The same threat is very common here
Though on one particular occasion I remember being told I'd end up "feeding ducks in the village", as in "so fucking stupid all you can do is feed livestock in a rural area" ...though, ironically, "ducks" can be used as slang for *dicks*.
I don't know of any specific job that gets called out like this here but there's a common saying that you should study hard so you won't have to work hard, which is wrong on so many levels
I mean, I know it stems from the older generations not seeing mental labor as "work" but still
I am sure most of them are joking
No i meant that i am pretty sure that a lot of the Europeans that say that people from texas ride horse to school are most likely not from a city or really *not smart*. I wonder why would educated americans think this way about France and probably other parts of Europe though
We have this dish called "zapekanka", which roughly translated to "baked", but "zapek" also means constipation, so one day Facebook exploded with pictures of a [dinner menu] offering tourists "Constipation with yellow cheese". Also, the word for "tongue" and "language" in Bulgarian is "ezik", so the same menu offered "Language in butter".
The most terrible professional translation, I've ever seen was literal translation of the phrase "for crying out loud" in a Kurt Vonnegut’s novel "The sirens of Titan". A literal translation of this phrase makes absolutely no sense, so when I figured out what the original was, I wanted to find the translator and rip their diploma apart
A classic one from many years ago is the pawn shop that was translated to English as *”hostage house”*
A funny one for me is names
In general names get literal translations but every now and then translators decide to be clever or some shit and we get some gems
For example the Wolverine(the hero not the animal) is called the Wearwolf, which makes no sense
Another one comes from the Lord of the Rings Books
In them the translator was like “Hey, what if I translate the Bag in Baggins
”, leading to me getting acquainted with the Torbinses
But the funniest one I found a few weeks ago
I was with my grandma and was looking through her bookshelves
There I found a 1980’s translation of “The left hand of darkness” by Ursula Le Guin
And her name was translated as, I shit you not, Urshula lyoguin(read as you see)(Уршула Льогуин)
Like, I get where he was coming from with her last name
It sounds French, so it makes sense to me in some way, but where the fuck did that sh come from
And note, in bookstores I’ve seen translations that translate her name normally, so what the fuck was Boris Mindov smoking
Как изобщо?
за плачене навън шумно?

I love baked kashkaval in any form
Не за “For crying out loud”. Как изобщо може някой да реши че това е в едно и също полукълбо с верния превод?

Usually at the end of June 30 degrees are the norm here
This is the first day since the April snowfalls to have such temperatures
We had a very cold and rainy spring
Nah bro it's not hot at all it been fucking raining
One the last two days we have had actual nice weather
Sofia (the city I live in) is 550 meters above sea level and it's the third highest European capital after Madrid and Andorra la Vella
In early March and late November we can get -5 in the morning and 15 in the afternoon
Sofia is at the base of Vitosha mountain so we technically have snow until early July (because Cherni vrah Peak is within the municipality and it's 2290 meters high)
It is a rare event to have snow in April and many people are worried for their harvests, when it happens, because the trees and the early cultures have already blossomed
But it happened this year
We'll be fine
Dobrudzha has seen worse and Trakiya is always warm, so even if the early harvest fails, Trakiya will pick up the slack
But from what I've seen from my friends to the North, the fields are almost ready for the first harvest of grain
After all, we have to keep up the export quotas to the rest of the EU, Lybia and Egypt
A country of ruins
Both literally and figuratively
Almost all Bulgarians identify themselves as Bulgarians first and foremost, then regionally
The Šops and Macedonians tend to identify more regionally than most other Bulgarians
A mix of healthcare and paid leave for vacation
But unfortunately, some of your countrymen seem to think these things are "communist".

The first article of a state's Constitution usually reflects or rejects the spirit of the last one
So, naturally, the Constitution of the Republic of Bulgaria starts with the dissolution of the People's Republic of Bulgaria:
>**Art
***(1) Bulgaria shall be a republic with a parliamentary form of government
*(2) The entire power of the State shall derive from the people
The people shall exercise this power directly and through the bodies established by this Constitution
*(3) No part of the people, no political party nor any other organization, state institution or individual shall usurp the expression of the popular sovereignty
And the preamble is:
>*We, the Members of the Seventh Grand National Assembly, guided by our desire to express the will of the people of Bulgaria, by pledging our loyalty to the universal human values of liberty, peace, humanism, equality, justice and tolerance; by holding as the highest principle the rights, dignity and security of the individual; in awareness of our irrevocable duty to guard the national and state integrity of Bulgaria, hereby proclaim our resolve to create a democratic and social state, governed by the rule of law, by establishing this*
> ####Article 1
>(1) Bulgaria shall be a republic with a parliamentary form of government
>(2) The entire power of the State shall derive from the people
The people shall exercise this power directly and through the bodies established by this Constitution
>(3) No part of the people, no political party nor any other organization, state institution or individual shall usurp the expression of the popular sovereignty
The rest can be found in English [here]
So, this is a funny one
We were in London and decided to go to a musical/play in one of the theaters
Everything was awesome, the music was great and so on
During the 15 minute break in the middle of the show a girl comes out, carrying a "briefcase" or more like a box that looked like a box for medical emergencies, with a defibrillator or something like that
We're looking at her with my SO, and we're thinking - oh, it looks like someone got sick or needs a doctor, that's pitty, we hope they'll be fine
And then
The girl opened the box and inside
there was ice-cream
in the theatre
In the beautiful building with beautiful interior and seats
And she started selling ice cream
And people were eating it inside
It was funny, because if in our country someone tried to get ice cream inside he'll be thrown out in no time
And there they were selling it themselves
Northwestern Bulgaria (Vidin, Montana, Vratsa, Pleven) and the Kardzhali region
The guys in Northwestern Bulgaria are very poor, poor transport and infrastructure   the same is with the region of Kardzhali
The government does not care with these regions and Kardzhali are siding with Turkey, while in the Northwest some even want to be part of Romania
Saddness is most places here
The northern parts of the country used to be very culturally significant and important for food production but they're steadily declining, more and more schools and entire villages are shutting down, libraries and cultural centres in towns and cities, etc
I watched a brief report about how one town where the entire fire department was *2 people*.
In the West, the city of Pernik spent *months* without water this past year
I think they have some available now
Just
*the whole city*, without any water
In addition to that, the mob presence is stronger in everyday life than other cities, from what friends have told me
Ever heard of Vratsa Region
Lol
I guess that one time in 1277, when Ivaylo, a peasant from Northern Bulgaria, led an uprising that resulted in the demise of emperor Konstantin Tih Asen
After the defeat, Ivaylo took the throne and ruled for a year until 1279
Summer time
I don't care about when it get darks in the winter - it can already get dark at 16, so it doesn't bother me if it's earlier
I do care about having more sunlight during the summer in the evening, however, especially at the sea
Unpopular opinion: keep it
Both of the other 2 options are worse
If we kept summer time, in the winter it would be dark until 9:00-10:00 which will make getting out of bed ever more difficult for most people, it is just not natural to get up 3 hours BEFORE sunrise
If we kept winter time, in the summer the sun would rise at 4:00-5:00, which will mess with a lot of people's sleep
And also, it would mean 1 less hour of enjoying the sunlight after work, so that sucks
Honestly, daylight saving time was a good idea and does more good than harm
Ideally, I would like it to be a gradual transition over a month (say, 15mins per week) instead of the sudden 1 hour jerk, so people wouldn't feel it, but it's still better than the alternatives
This was supposed to be done last year already
I, and everyone I've asked about this here prefer summer time
Though apparently there were polls on it and 60% preferred summer time, so not that much of an overwhelming majority
Even though we were allies with Hitler and part of the Axis Powers, we didn't send a single Jew to the concentration camps, although Hitler put pressure on us to do so
Even to this date a lot of Israelis come each year specifically to Bulgaria to visit because they still remember what we did for them
Edit: We were the only country in Europe alongside with Denmark, who did not obey Hitler's orders and did not send its Jewish population
We did a bloodless revolution too
Didn't work that well
>Never in our history have we had an expansion war
Even if you only count from the unification of Romania, there's the second Balkan War and both World Wars
European cities are not so driver-friendly as their US counterparts, so they'll have to do some serious remodelling whatever they choose
Sunny Beach in Bulgaria
There's literally a district in Plovdiv named "The Trap". As the name suggests, it's very popular with tourists
In Sofia I would say Vitosha bul
I just don't get it
If you want to eat from McDonald's why bother coming to another  country to do so
Also restaurants there are very bleak and don't represent the original BG cuisine at all and food in general isn't very good for the price you pay to sit there
If you want to go to a good restaurant then you can totally walk through the little streets that lead to Vitosha bul
- there you can find extravagant and or little but cosy restaurants and pay half the price
Also you have to check up Graf Ignatiev str
for cute little shops and coffee shops
The street is more pleasant to go, have a walk and enjoy the beautiful day than going to a mall or H&M.
Yeah, same one
It's pretty nice honestly
I remember I hated it when I visited 10 years ago, totally different picture now
They've paid a lot of attention on tourism and making it overall pretty neat and tidy
People are pretty chill, it's kind of our stereotype for them
Good lads, how else would you see the beauty of the Bulgarian male physique
Joking aside, ultras/nazis/meatheads/wannabe gangsters are a thing in the major cities unfortunately
Glad you like the city tho :)
I eat yoghurt with everything
I wear adidas tracksuits
I am very racis- I mean, what
My grandfather taught me to write like that, he called it Blockschrift
He was half-German, maybe that explains it
Balkans, but it's more like a wishful and nostalgic sigh with a tear in our eye
North Macedonia
Also Northern Dobruja from Romania
And Southern Macedonia from Greece
And Eastern Thrace from Turkey
And the Western Morava valley from Serbia
Ahh, irredentism
We joke abput BULGARIA ON THREE SEAS
some ppl actually take it seriusly
For some of our parties it's not a joke
They're quite openly calling for taking Macedonia, Albania and Northern Greece
The good news is their power in parliament has diminished
Like: Cyprus is Greek, Macedonia is Bulgarian, Kosovo is Serbia, Constantinopol not istanbul
Change my mind
> We are a split country
Half the population actually want PiS in charge
Basically you're in the same situation as the US right now
I don’t understand the whole race classification thing
What’s the difference between hispanic white and non hispanic white
How’s a white person of Spanish descent different to a white person of French descent, for example
I’ve been asked what race I was once, by an American
I just replied I was Bulgarian, then she asked me if I was Latino
So many things haha
Tipping culture outside of food & beverage especially
Like tipping a nail artist or hair dresser
I've read about Americans getting a terrible haircut or bad service and still tipping "because you're supposed to"... like
no wtf
I've seen what nail artists over there charge $60 for and it's a rip off
I cannot fucking believe you also *tip* for that
I've noticed a lot of Americans aproach things a certain way
It's kind of hard to explain without making a huge overly simplified generalization but for example, imagine we're talking about food, right, and it's like burgers or steaks or something
And I mention something about bbq grills not being a common item here, for example
This gets followed by like
disbelief
Like WHAT ?? You DON'T HAVE this ESSENTIAL ITEM
Like the very idea of the American Lifestyle Experience^(TM) not being available in this other place (which *isn't* a third world country, so it must be *liveable*) is just so weird
What is there then
What do you use
*How do you live
I'm sure this also applies to people state-to-state
I know Floridians are shocked when there's no AC in northern states, for example
It's just something I noticed in Americans and found funny
Like you guys tend to be super used to your own personalised notions of normality and you aproach new things starting from the American perspective, not from a "blank slate" perspective
I think this is where the stereotype of how "Americans are ignorant" comes from
Which is unfair because *everybody* is ignorant about something
You guys aren't that special
The stupidity is quite alarming
What do you guys do at school
Fast food in Europe is vastly different due to a hell of a lot stricter food safety laws, which also makes it a bit less unhealthy
This post is a month old, how the fuck did you even find it haha
They are rarely the same thing, if ever
American bbqs tend to be very large and outdoor only
Pretty much every bbq here is more of a *grill* than a bbq
[American bbqs] vs [most bbqs I've seen in Europe]
The whole point of my example ties into the way Americans approach foreign subjects though
For example, (assuming you're Dutch) and we're talking about breakfast, I could say "peanut butter isn't that popular here" and you go on a tangent about how "What do you put hagelslag on
Just regular butter
" without even taking a second to consider that hagelslag is not very popular *at all* outside of the Netherlands
In Bulgaria you have 2 days off for a funeral of a blood related family member, or spouse
2 days for your marriage, and we have 45 days sick leave to take care of children per year
I don't know if this counts but men do get 15 days paternity leave, from the day the mother of your child is discharged from the hospital
[Shiroka laka] or [Koprivshtitsa]
Every travel vlog about Bulgaria focuses on Sofia, the Rila Monastery and Plovdiv and sometimes - Veliko Tarnovo
~~Sunny beach
It's not really a city, more of a seasonal summer resort but the place is extremely trashy with drugs, alcohol, sex and scams going rampant
Not really anything to do other than drinking either
So unless you come to Bulgaria for sex or alcohol tourism, let's pretend it doesn't exist, okay~~
EDIT: Read the question wrong, don't visit Sunny Beach
Go to Rhodope instead, it's the big mountain next to Greece
Any city or village there sees very few tourists but the hiking trails in the West Rhodope are amazing
Many caves too
Or if you like ancient history, go to East Rhodope - there are dozens of ancient temples, fortresses, very well preserved Roman villa
A lot of it isn't well researched but there is a certain charm in looking at an ancient temple or fortress before it saw excavations and is officially open to tourists
Not a Bulgarian city
I thought Montenegro as a whole was quite cool
Hissarya
The town's mineral waters literally heal diseases and the ancient part of the city is still surrounded with massive ancient fortifications
The Romans knew what they were doing when they built it in the first place
Well in Bulgarian Ne meens no in Greek Ne meens yes
Pronoused the same
And we use chao pronoused as the Italian hello - ciao , in Bulgarian mean Bye
On a tram in Vienna
To be fair Bulgarian is not spoken by many, so they probably felt safe in talking loud
Anyway, at one stop a crying boy and an elderly woman (his grandmother, probably) come on
It seems to boy got in a fight in school so the grandma advised him in a rather loud voice: "Next time just kick them in the balls and run away". I had a "coughing fit" at hearing this
The Spansh cards look like the large Arcanas of the Tarot cards
Bellow 15C is starting to get cold in my opinion,  below 10C is cold and below 5C is freezing
I like cold, so for me to feel cold it would probably need to be around 0-10 degrees
hahaha *cries in aphantasia*
In Turkish it means that the person with the big balls (sometimes just the balls like a man with balls) has a lot of connections and money i. e. powerfull
Having balls means being brave here too although there is a good thing called "боли ме хуя/boli me huya" directly translates "my dick hurts" means "I don't care"
Go in Bulgaria everything is almost free for people from Western Europe
Sunny Beach is a generic resort made specifically to scam foreigners out of money so don't worry about not liking it haha
The taxi drivers are notorious scammers, it's insane
Tried charging me 50 leva for a distance that's normally worth about 15 at most
At ballotage, yes
Otherwise the people I vote for are "I trust your intentions but not your ability to pull it off".
I’m pretty sure we have one of the highest percentage rates of smokers in the EU it’s extremely common but a lot of people are switching out cigarettes for other things such as IQOS
Well we are second in Europe and sixth in the world in percentage of the population that smokes (tobacco that is)
35% and rising in the last 6 years
Uncool
How TF
Here's the thing
When I smoked and lived in the UK, I could somehow always figure out a way to afford cigarettes and coffee
It's a skill
Granted usually at the detriment of say food, but hey appetite suppressant
Paris or the actually country of France
"Deep south" I've never heard Limburg described like that before
"Why are you guys still using the Russian alphabet
[Most probable reaction from a Bulgarian]
Calling the Cyrillic alphabet anything other than Bulgarian, especially Russian
Tell someone the Cyrillic alphabet is Russian/made in Russia they will try to murder you with words
Some ignorant Westerners think that Eastern Europe is just Russia and it's still socialist, which triggers the Bulgarian and the other ethnicities
Also we don't love the topic about Macedonia (North Macedonia)
Bulgarians (and surely many others) call any cheese with holes in it "Swiss cheese".
We call the UK "Angliya" ("England")
Once a Bulgarian, speaking English, presented a Scotswoman as a lady "from England". She got mad and shouted "Scotland
" at the top of her lungs
Phoebe must be cringing hard right now
Ok, West Russian
I beg to differ [
One of my Macedonian Bulgarian ancestors emigrated to Northeastern Bulgaria, so in a sense it fits
We have the second worst demographic crisis in the world, behind Lithuania
There were 2 guys named Evlogi and Hristo Georgievi
They had around 23 million Bulgarian levas (or 11
5 million euros) and the population of the Principality of Bulgaria (1878-1908) had 6 million (3 million euros) - combined
They were rich as fuck
Where
Done
Danke schön.
It's definitely not *that* common
It's way more common on the seaside than by a pool
I don't think I've seen a topless lady at a pool, in fact, I'm pretty sure it's generally not allowed
I'd say it's rare, about
one in 30 women
A small percentage but I don't think it's anything particularly shocking for anyone, just rare
Entirely nude is *very rare* for either sex, though there's usually small more-or-less designated areas for that
However, it's very common for kids up until puberty to be topless, until about 11 probably
Other visitors to Bulgarian beaches are more than welcome to share their findings, I haven't been to the beach in too long :(
In my country it's less than 5%. Probably because of our culture being much more hostile to nudity in public than other Europeans'. Whenever I go to a public beach, there are always 2 or 3 topless women in sight, but no more
Yeah, I have also noticed that
Not only Germans in particular, but rather people from Central/Western/Northern Europe
They are extremely blunt
They can say anything to you no matter how inappropriate it is, without taking into consideration your feelings and how this will make you feel
I hate that so much
I always try to make people feel not like shit, so even when I get asked about my opinion or if I see something wrong, most times I will lie and say it's ok or just won't say anything (not with close friends of course)
And don't come at me with obvious dumb shit like you see someone who has toilet paper sticking out of his pants and you won't say anything, no of course, if you have some social skills you know when to be honest and when to keep what you have to say to yourself
I just don't like making other people uncomfortable, because I hate being in such situations myself when other people make me feel like the way you were treated
Sure, they can Google you no one will find out, that way they can be at an ease that you are not some psychopath and it should stay only with them this info, but bringing it up, that is what I am talking about bluntness and pure stupidity
Makes sense, if you ask me
I understand Middle English best, Early Modern is
tricky
I kind of get it but it feels trickier than Middle English
Old English is a lost cause though
I understand Scots perfectly,  I think that's why Middle English is easier for me
This is the part I admit Shakespeare just isn't my strong point lmao
What I got was: "If you lie, you will be hung on the next tree until you are starving, if you speak truth (googled it to make sure
)" aaaaand that's all I got
And then some "Ring the alarm" towards the end
Genuinely zero understanding of anything in between
Like
I think I understand the word
But I understand them all seperately
I can just feel my old English teacher glaring at me for this now haha
We have vonfire day - Pokladi here its on the 49th day before Easter,  we say sorry to all of our family members,  then big , tall bonfires were let on fire we stay  and dance around them,  when they start to die of the tradition say that the young mans of the community should jump above the dying coles
[He was a Bulgarian MP in the European Parliament
] Don't know how he even got there, but everybody made fun of his English and overall incompetence
While Axis Bulgaria saved its 50000 Jews from concentration camps, mostly after civil uproar and unrest, the pro-fascist government happily shipped 10000 Jews from occupied Macedonia to Auschwitz shortly before that
It is not true that Bulgaria did not have control, and the cabinet was enthusiastic in its service to the Reich
It is just that the wider public knew nothing about it
This was brought to light by few individuals and wide civil unrest prevented the extradition of Jews from country proper
Don't actually know what Bulgaria did to be fair
In sure we've got some non - medieval stuff
The Inquisition in fact resulted in few convictions, as opposed to the witch trials in Protestant Europe
Nevertheless witch trials had like 100000 convicted over a couple of centuries for whole Europe, mostly in war zones, so while terrible, they are far from the biggest atrocities
Pogroms on minorities were worse alone
Helping Germany in both world wars
Like most of its neighbours, Bulgaria has a lot of ancient traditions still kept but one of the most fascinating ones to me is our kuker festivals
At the beginning of spring every year we have festivals around the country where men would dress with thick costumes made of animal hydes and fur and wear a ton of giant bells around their waists
Once the festival begins they start jumping around, making noise with their bells and scaring the evils and demons of the winter away
Sometimes they even do little ritual re-enactments of the everyday lives of our ancestors as a blessing for good health, good harvest and happy family
For us Bulgarians that would be the Martenitsa, for health every March first until Spring
Радвам се да гледам и чета сърбин и хърватин да си говорят и да се разбират!!! Браво братя!
A Bulgarian that dosent eat yogurt
A Bulgarian that can't fix anything
I thought about rakija but that also applies to the rest of our Balkan siblings
In Bulgarian the sun is neuter, while the earth, the moon and the stars are feminine
Sun is neuter, Moon is feminine
A male form for the moon exists which is also the word for “month”.
The Moon is always depicted as a woman
Some folklore has it as Queen of the female spirits
The Sun is always depicted as male, even though it’s neuter
In bulgarian it's Слънцето (read like this: Slŭntseto) (male) and Луната (read like this: Lunata) (female)
Bulgarian:
Sun - Слънце - Slance/Slunce (neutral)
Moon - Луна - Luna (feminine)
Earth - Земя - Zemya/Zemq (feminine)
Yeah, you're right
I am just used to saying it like it's male but it really is neutral
For Bulgaria it would be the Bulgarian empire under Simeon in about 900 AC
Huge territories, from today's Greece to Budapest
And as a whole - rich, powerful country and also cultural boom
Latin, though it isn't used many languages have their roots set in Latin
Meaning you can understand those languages to a certain degree
Edit: oh wait you said job market
EU: German; SA: Spanish; Africa: French; Asia: Mandarin
How exactly is Russian a rare language
It's one of the most spoken languages in Europe
It's really hard
In Bulgarian we usually shorten up words when we talk to others which is not taught in schools
We also have a lot of dialect words
However, I've seen foreigners speak fluently, so it's not impossible
Sounding like a native Bulgarian speaker, when considering only the sounds of the language and the pronunciation, is perfectly doable and I have seen many foreigners do it
The grammar, on the other hand, is quite strange even for speakers of other Slavic languages and foreigners almost always make the same mistakes that to a native speaker seem so silly and will reveal the fact that you are a non-native within seconds
We don't really mind these though - we know that our language is complicated and whenever someone takes the time to sit and learn even the slightest bit of it we try our best to be encouraging
It's really easy to say "next to impossible" but it's actually *not*. It takes *effort*. A lot of it
But it is entirely possible
I've met foreigners with the *slightest* accents and excellent grammar, to the point I didn't even know they aren't native speakers, I just thought they were from different parts of the country
I'd say you need a minimum of a year or two of very active studying and immersion
And a very deciding factor of your pronounciation will be your native language and your ability to distance yourself from your native pronounciation - I find that this is where accents come from
Your mouth is just used to pronouncing things a certain way
Both grammar and pronounciation are equally difficult for foreigners but again, it would depend on native language
Slavic speakers have a better chance
Impossible, both grammar and pronunciation
I can immediately spot a non-native speaker even from other Slavic languages, let alone from other language families speakers
Three good examples are a Russian sexologist who has been living in Bulgaria since I can remember myself
My god she speaks Bulgarian awful both grammatical and oral
Unlike the rest of the Slavic languages, Bulgarian has articles and she never uses "the", so it sounds like your typical Russian in American movies with bad grammar and bad pronunciation
Another example is a Croatian guy who came from Bosnia like 25 years ago, he was a child around 13 I think and he still to this date does not speak perfect Bulgarian, I can clearly hear his accent and he is from a very close language to Bulgarian, gives you an idea that anyone else will be impossible for them to speak like a native
Third example is from an Italian guy I think he has been living here for 30 years, it feels like he has been living here for only a year
His Bulgarian is practically shit
The only guys I have heard who speak basically like natives are Macedonians, they basically have to change their accents
I saw on the news 3 Macedonian guys were living for 10 years in Bulgaria and they sound 100% like natives, I was impressed
I'd say it is pretty hard to learn both for Bulgarian
I have met my share of foreigners who have settled in Bulgaria, but pronunciation-wise I have never heard someone adapt fully
I am not saying it is impossible, but I'd assume it is really hard
Grammar I think is more manageable, but it is not a whole lot easier, either
Overall, I'd say it is hard not to spot a foreigner, even if he has lived for a long time in Bulgaria
Lol, that's hilarious
why am i reading this with a french accent in my mind
Thank you to Russia for helping liberate us from the ottomans
Thank you to Greece, Serbia and Montenegro for helping us kick the ottomans out of the Balkans
Thank you to all the western Europeans that founded the EU keeping peace on the continent and which will eventually turn all of Europe into a great place to live
And of course thank you to Romania for being our bros
I would like to thank Russia for helping Bulgaria getting it's independence back from the ottoman empire
The fires have been covered because the fire season in Bulgaria is also raging with 4 fires currently
The Party Conventions were covered and now the US is mostly reported on in terms of the pandemic or whatever the Trump gem of the day is
Some days we have no news from the US
>Hourly
Daily
Weekly
Is it annoying
Too much
Are you okay with it
We don't have 24/7 news channels like you guys
Our typical "main news broadcast" is 30 minutes, 15 of which are events from Bulgaria and 15 - international news, so daily, the US gets
max 5-10 minutes across all news broadcasts, but most of that are repeats of the same news, which is fine
It's important to know what's happening over there but naturally - we are more interested in what's happening in Europe
Newspapers and their news sites have more coverage on the US because they are constantly producing content
Only if something happened like a school shooting, or something stupid Trump said, or some new invention is made there
We dont have a lot of USA centered news
Recetly USA is more common because of the elections you guys have
Actual combing
He doesn't do euphemisms or metaphors really, but his base always claims he is "just joking" even though the only time I saw a genuine laugh out of that man was when someone called Hillary a dog or whatever it was, lol
One of the best subbredits
We should keep up the great work, Europe
nice, a pyrocynical fan
I don't really support this united superpower idea it is going to destroy the identity of so many people
And it probably won't last that long
[Sunny beach
] I don't understand the desire to go on such a crowded place and call it "a holiday" just for some dirt cheep debauchery
German pentioners are already very present to the North
Yeah
First (and last) time I was there, I went on a date with this Irishman
I couldn't keep up
Nesebar is my favourite city but the noise of Sunny beach is ruining the whole area
I’d say “Google it” but that will be a very sad search
You don't have to apologise
Maybe I am just getting old and slowly morf into the "back in my days" kinda guy, but Sunny beach was a beautiful resort
Now it's overdeveloped, underregulated and pathetic in terms of social infrastructure
Like I said: dirt cheap debauchery
I get drunk after 1,5 pints of lager
That sucks
But we have the benefit to have learned to have fun without alcohol :)
Well, that's maybe North Macedonia, but also our neighbours can be rivals too, but Greece are rivals with Turkey; Romania are with Hungary; Serbia are with Croatia and Bosnia
Soo ,yeah North Macedonia
I don’t think Bulgaria has one
But maybe North Macedonia
After thinking about this I don't think Bulgaria has one at the moment
A rival has to be at least semi-equal to you
Most Europeans are ahead and a few are behind so there is no rival
at the moment
Water
That's your rival
Very true
But they are like our little brothers bro
I think most Bulgarians see Macedonia as our little brother rather than a rival
I think most Bulgarians see Macedonia as our little brother rather than a rival
We don't think of you guys as rivals at all
More like our little cousin who is in his rebelious teenager phase
Annoying, but cute
Yes, but they are still our rivals (at some point)
I also think Serbia is a great rival and Greece too
Exactly
Kind of like a younger brother that we love even though they hate us
No dude I don't think you guys are
At all
I see you guys as like a cousin or a little brother more than anything else tbh
Love you guys
Haha, we're always cursing those damn Romanians and their damn decent (looking) economy
Seriously though, even the smaller cities I've been to in Romania are stunning compared to Bulgarian infrastructure
They aren't our rivals
Not historically and certainly not now
We don't really have rivals
I know I shouldn't have laughed at this but I did
Look at us
bonding over Macedonians
Who would have thought
Trus in Bulgarian means quake/shake, divan - sofa and kvachka - duck/annoying person
> бабка - dragonfly (ukr)
Lol, it means old woman/grandma in Bulgarian too, that's pretty funny
It's usually used in a rude way too
Dinya in Bulgarian is watermelon
I like my life in Bulgaria, though sometimes I wish the people weren't so narrow-minded
I can have a decent quality of life and our politics are too entertaining to miss out
As a Bulgarian I imagine living here after l get a high-paying job wouldn't be much worse than living in a more developed country
But then l realise l'm one of the lucky ones who have yet not been humiliated by
the way everything works here
Yes, as long as we're healthy and financially stable it'll be all good
Until our health declines and we need quality medical care that we can't find here
Until an oligarch tries to pressure us to do something and we need protection from the law but he owns the law
Until one of the countless drunk driver scum crashes into us after our corrupt police let him drive
Corruption and our тарикатлък is a sickness that plagues every single bit of our beautiful country and you never know when it will ruin your life
Oh gosh
Two years ago the same kind of non-sense gained a lot of traction here (people completely misunderstanding the concept of gender as a social construct)
But I feel like while we're not progressive on these issues by any means, at least people who violently oppose the 'third gender' are not taken seriously
And we basically don't talk about this anymore
I wonder what went differently in Romania
But damn, banning an entire academic field
what happened to free speech
It's ironic given how often alt-right people complain about violations of their free speech
And I always tend to think about Romania and Bulgaria as the same thing lol How are things going with LGBT rights in Romania
Do you feel like society is getting more accepting
I personally feel optimistic about Bulgaria
All are valid concerns, there is for certain a lot of work left to be done to catch up with the west
The law is all there - it's just not enforced
Not to the people in power, not to the common person who drives home every night after a few rakias
I believe that this is a workable state of affairs - certainly a lot of work is needed - but with a couple of elections going in the right direction we can fix that
Let's stay positive
In our constitution it says "between a man and a woman" :(
Literally the only issue Bulgarians are progressive about is abortion - I think around 90% of Bulgarians support it, it's so excepted there isn't even a debate
I would really love to see same-sex mariagge legalised and for people to become more open-minded (when it comes to all kinds of issues), but it's a very long road ahead
Well, there's some hope at least
One of our biggest problems in my opinion is our huuuuge inferiority comlplex
And we end up compensating by excessively praising mediocre achievements of Bulgarians(often times emmigrants who probably don't identify with being Bulgarian much) instead of focusing on what we can do here and now and believing in ourselves
Sounds super corny, but I feel we don't believe that Bulgaria and Bulgarians can do good stuff and the result is a mix of self-hatred and nationalism :D
Do you feel like Romanians have the same problem
Sometimes I forget that we are literally bordering Turkey and we are right on the doorway to Asia
> No Australia creatures
Hahahaha, best advantage EVER
Lack of sunlight is not good and can lead to depression
It’s totally different if it’s cold but a clear sunny day
IDK if Russia counts as European here, but for me it was fear of prosecution
Russia gone very anti-LGBT in the last decade and back then it was on a verge of passing a law to take away adopted kids form LGBT people
I'm bi and one of my kids is adopted
We packed our stuff and left country as fast at was possible
Actually, this one was so bad it was kinda good
Lots of people who were indifferent to LGBT problems before got really angry at the creators of these ads
Like "wtf do they think we are THAT stupid
Чем же?
Da se izdrusam - Literally "to shake myself"
Da drusam krushata - To shake the pear tree
Da leya tuhli - To pour bricks
Kъртицата рови (kartitsata rovi) - the mole is digging
That's when you really need to go
I dont think its really funny but, "да дряскам" is a close translation to taking a dump
A colleague of mine used to say "I am going to ride the porcelain horse"
да се изтропам (da se iztropam) - to knock myself
[Finally we can go it alone
It was one of the few car models Bulgarians were allowed to buy, so - yeah
Ha, I only knew it as Niva, and it seems they've changed it yet again - it's [Bronto] now
Thanks for clarifying
Wow, what a story this car has with names
This is the one most appalling habit of some Western European countries
I can't really understand how you can stay 16 hours in shoes - and specifically why choose to do so
Do you wear shoes in the toilet
You takes them off near your bed
Sleep with shoes
rakija is meant to be shared
That's the price you pay for going out clubbing
Even in many (most) European countries if you invite someone home at meal time, it is assumed that there will be a meal - otherwise it should be stated explicitly
Even better - choose a different time
Booze and chips is college party
It's cardinal sin in most of Europe as well
Well, when in Rome
But this doesn't change the essence of the habit
Oh, damn near every fairytale featured some beheading, torture or other brutality
There was one story where the dashing hero just so decided to kill the (innocent) kids of three demonesses by jump-scaring them and letting them fall into a firepit
He then went on to mutilate and rob the demonesses and later had to feed the undead in some grave to get some answers
Another hero had to concoct an elaborate plot to sedate and then blind the princess' demon kidnapper
Said hero also had to weigh some gold as compensation for his father's unjust execution
against the weight of his father's head
Heroes were pieces of work even when they didn't kill monsters
It was a frequent motif for them to steal a (often magical) girl's clothes while she was bathing to extort her into marrying them, or killing all her guards just to bang her and then fly away
An evil princess, on the other hand, could have them imprisoned, beaten and tortured if she just didn't like them
Evil siblings abounded and they were usually fine with their brother/sister being killed, which was frequently paid back to them with little hesitation
Oh, and good old racism
Traits not seen in Europeans (dark skin or slanted eyes) were reserved for characters who were monstrous in some manner - servant spirits, cursed kings, evil conquerors, you name it
Can confirm
Also had the un-sugarcoated versions of the Grimm Brothers fairy tales
Not even just that, but a lot of our folk tales don't have a lesson like "be a good person and things will work out", some of them are like "so this guy tricked everyone and got all of their money, he's so clever
", which is in sharp contrast to stories in America where he would certainly learn some kind of lesson about not trying to scam people out of money
lol
Yeah, although if you're referring to Hitar Petar, his exploits most often target either corrupt characters (the priest, the mayor, a cook who was trying to charge him for sniffing the food) or a rival trickster
[I am pretty sure Bulgaria's PM will win
He has a whole arsenal
Edit: I just remembered [THIS] about the current president as well lol
I'm pretty sure it would be someone from eastern europe pulling out a broken rakija bottle and stabbing everyone else
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
and then stealing their suits
Boyko was something like a boxer or something
Maybe just a bodyguard
Either way he'd probably get judo chopped by putin
KGB only teaches you how to torture people
Or was that its predecessors the NKVD
"Don't f*** with me
I have the power of God and anime on my side
I can hear the [Hallelujah]
LOL, that actually cracked me up
Haven't heard about it tho, but I wouldn't be surprised, he lies about a lot of things
Literal goat maybe
* Boiling jars with fruits or veggies over an open fire
Roasting huge amounts peppers over an open fire, then boiling them in jars
Making lyutenitsa in big pans over an open fire
Some people still do that, mostly in rural areas, but its getting rarer and rarer
* Romani tinsmiths - they coated the inside of the large cauldrons and pans used above with tin to keep them clean and rust-free
* Dancing bears
I also saw a dancing monkey once
The practice was banned due to animal welfare concerns and the remaining retired dancing bears now live in a sanctuary
Most of the bears were abused, the ropes used to train and handle them were tied to rings pierced through their sensitive noses
They often suffered from malnutrition - I remember a handler asking a kid to throw some bread from the balcony for the bear to eat
* Photographers offering pictures with stuffed roe deers
It was common for children to be photographed like this:
(Yes, that's me looking like a psycho
on a stuffed deer
* Also very cold winters with heavy snow
The winter I was born, the Danube river froze
I think I've seen ONE like that in my life, and I'm 32 years old
There is however someone very, very dedicated to religious posters about hell here in Varna
They're all over the city and I'm told it's one person putting them everywhere
I've never seen anything like it in Bulgaria or other Balkan countries
It seems a distinctly American thing to me
Here religious types are usually fairly low-profile, except for the church higher-ups, who drive fancy sports cars and flash their rolex watches and gold teeth like some kind of cartoon mafia boss (which they are) and everybody hates them
Bold of you to assume the church has any money left after communism
This is so prevalent recently in my town, there's a mad old lady that is glueing them on the back of every road sign
There used to be none, and now the place is littered with them, and police doesn't seem to care (she's been photographed several times by different people, so probably not hard to identify her)
And it's not even feel-good messages like "Jesus is coming", but crudely drawn devil faces with "Don't be part of Satan's play" and similar
And now the newly developed "Covid-19 doesn't exist, it's the Satan's deception" and the like
I can only speculate she's in some religious sect that is helping her, or she's completely gone off her rocker and devoted all her time into this, cause I can't fathom how she's continuing to do it for 5+ years
I've never seen anything like this in any other towns in my country, so I guess it's the work of one person or small group
The one thing that really surprised me in Slovakia was dedicated religious TV channels and even sometimes they would show mass and other rituals on the regular channels
Never seen anything similar anywhere else I’ve been
> Here religious types are usually fairly low-profile
Communism
The last one made me laugh IRL gj
Yeah, and that's a good thing
For Bulgarians it's Macedonian and Serbian
I'd personally struggle with Russian as the grammar is way different, but some people understand it quite a bit
Polish, Czech and Slovak are really different and I'd barely understand a few words
Pretty much all slavic languages if you talk slowly
Written is even better
If you talk slowly I can understand Russian and Slovak
Even more so if it is written
For me, without a formal education in the language, Russian is understandable when written but it's much more challenging when spoken
Maybe I'm just retarded then, my boyfriend of an year and a half is Slovak and neither of us understands the other's language  it's English for us with some Bulgarian and slovak words thrown in for fun
Name days
I have some distant cousins in the US that are third generation emigrants, they can barely speak Bulgarian but they still celebrate their name days
So glad someone said this
I worked with a girl in the states who's grandparents were Bulgarian
she spoke no Bulgarian and had never been
but still celebrated her name day
Yeah, i can totally agree with you
Most of the time we celebrate name days more than our birthdays
Guess it is a regional kink
I don't know about the rest of the Balkans but in Bulgaria it is custom to invite people on your birthday, but on your name day people are meant to ivite themselves and you can't turn them away
I have two name days, so I have three parties a year haha
Баница (Banitsa)
Look it up if you want
It's wonderful food filled with cheese
It's amazing especially when it's homemade
Most iconic: Yogurt
We have our own version of it thanks to a unique bacterium only found in bulgaria
We convinced the chinese that it's the secret to longevity
If only longevity was the cause of our aging population
Most unique/least contested/personal pick: Liutenica
Think of it as a healthier, salty rather than sweet, pepper instead of tomato-based ketchup, and it is delicious
Paired with balkan cheese, 'colour salt' spices, and spread on a slice of bread, it's a culinary masterpiece (no bias at all, I only grew up on this :)
Additional things you might want to check out is boza, a wheat-based creamy sweet drink, banitza, pastry filled typically with cheese (balkan cheese, not that yellow stuff), and tarator, basically what the greeks call tzatziki but made with bulgarian yogurt, garlic, and it's a soup instead of a salad (it's ideal for hot summer weather)
Suma sumarum: We have fantastic food, so please visit/invest to help our weak economy :(
Edit: Am blind, didn't read title
From what I've gathered your most ubiquitous food was smazhaak/fried cheese
Every single food place regardless of general theme, also had this in the menu
The fast food variant is mostly Banichka, what means little (portable) banitsa
It's often purchased with Ayran (yogurt drink) or Boza, that looks like chocolate milk, but it isn't. Try it only if you are brave
Well some people put flags on their house but its not very common and most people dont care if you have one or not
I kid, I kid, but
We are on 64th day of anti-government protests here, in large part catalyzed by these photos taken secretly of our long-standing prime-minister - stacks of 500 euro banknotes and golden bars stashed in his residence drawers (presumably bribes brought by visitors)
Also the paranoid fuck sleeps with a glock on his drawer, despite being guarded by our national security agency - again presumably because he is so deep into schemes with criminals that he's afraid for his life, or the gun is just a habit out of his murky friend-with-racketeers-and-mafia past
There's of course numerous other scandals behind the protests, mostly of corruptional nature, but these leaked photos are known to everyone here these days, so pretty iconic even jokingly
Indeed
And he's the one that got himself there
It was probably his mistress though, he's been very shush about it while not outright denying the photos are real (and independent experts verified they're not photoshopped and from different days, so hard to smuglle ton of money and gold several times just to fake these photo-ops)
Air pollution is one of the biggest problems here
We live in an area that typically has very good air quality but on days when an "inversion" happens and there's no wind, its like looking out into a wall of smog with almost 0 visibility
You can taste it when you breathe, you can feel it stinging your eyes
I worry about all of the little kids who are out breathing this in on these days without a mask
Littering is very commonplace here and with such beautiful nature, it just breaks your heart
A lot of people are getting better about it and having public trashcans helps but seeing people just toss a soda bottle and burger wrapper from their car as they drive along is just so rage-inducing
I don't just don't get how you can be driving along a gorgeous mountain road and simultaneously contribute to it being trashed
The poor infrastructure means you had better have a durable car because you *will* incur damage
I popped 2 tires at the same time on a pothole here a few years ago and it was a huge pain to get a tow and get it dealt with
The highways here are wonderful however and are at a much higher standard than the surface streets
[One of my favourite clips
Not exactly the same thing, but in the 90s a satirical show named Ku Ku did a prank about an accident in the Nuclear Power Plant Kozloduy and a lot of people fell for it which led to the show being cancelled
I guess people fell for it because it was only a few years after Chernobyl and it was on the state TV channel
Plus the interviews with the "military guys" near the NPP does feel a bit like "we are in deep shit fuck off news reporters".
Here's a link with eng subs  -  main stuff begins at 1:25
Bulgaria
Someone help me add the flair, please
The importance of staying in touch with and speaking to the family often
As a kid it always felt like a bit of a chore, and questioned why we had to do it all the time
As an adult, I’m happy I’m very close with my grandparents etc
, and that I got to know everyone as well as I could
It’s now a highlight of my weekend when I call people to catch up
I used to hate dairy, and we're pretty notable for our dairy products, especially yoghurt
Now, I don't eat dairy *but* I really appreciate the yoghurt every once in a while
It is completely different from other varieties of yoghurt I've eaten abroad and has a sacred place in my heart
Cyrillic was created by Slavs, for Slavs
Like it or not, it's what peak performance looks like
As someone not living in Bulgaria currently, whenever I go back home, I’m always pleasantly surprised by our diary
I live in North America, which does help explain my surprise and delight
It tends to be very 'fluffy', like American bread, at least from supermarkets
I don't know about bakeries
It doesn't have much 'body' to it
Thank you
And success
No offense to any Americans, but the stuff they call yoghurt makes me want to cry
(No real experience with other North American countries though)
I'm from Bulgaria
But yes, it's a big part of the food culture here haha
I've tried American Greek yoghurt, and it tastes like sugar
I haven't really had too much cheese besides string cheese and that orange shredded cheese
And I admit, the ice cream (specifically Ben and Jerry's) is amazing
But ice cream is meant to be somewhat processed and sugary
That's fine hahaha, our flags are pretty similar
Not sure whether it counts as fast food or just a restaurant chain but I would love for the Bulgarian chain Happy to open in the UK city I moved to
They have great sushi and fish specialities in general
I was about to say Hesburgers but we have em here In Bulgaria
Nadias Sandwich from Denmark
Was always my go-to if I ever craved fast food
Bulgarian "happy" in the Netherlands
I know there's one in Spain
There is Hesburger in Bulgaria, but it is worse than McDonald's. I don't know if this is the general situation or just the local franchises
More specifically, in non-UK Europe English
1 The Byzantine empire/ Greece
The Ottoman empire / Turkey
Serbia
USSR/Russia
Romania
From most mentioned to least mentioned the top 5 would probably be:
Byzantium
Ottoman empire
Soviet Union
Germany
Macedonia (region)
1)Byzantine Empire - we had a bunch of wars and we made them pay us
2)Ottoman Empire - enslaved us
3)Serbia - we had a bunch of wars and we won most of them
4)Greece - not the country but their culture and Orthodox Christianity, a bit like a continuation of the Byzantines
5)Russia - they fought "for us" and they kinda did but then Alexander III didn't like our knyz since he didn't want to be a puppet
Most indoctrinated communists still believe that they freed us from the "fascist, classist and bourgeoisie" Tsar Boris III
Not including modern day North Macedonia which basically split from Bulgaria in the early 20th century the list would be
1 - Byzantium/Greece - our relation with them for some solid 350 years was 'war/short peace/war'. Bulgaria was also conquered by the Byzantines for about 150 years
2 - The Ottoman Empire/Turkey - we were part of the Ottomans for 480 years
Anything from their administrative/religious/cultural/etc aspects is studied regarding these two
3 - Serbia - neighbors, we've had a fair share of wars between us
4 - Romania - again neighbors, was under Bulgarian control in the First and some decades of the Second Bulgarian Tsardom
5 - Kievan Rus/Russia/USSR - we've had some early touching points like 970s occupation of Bulgaria by the Kievans, later in the 18th/19th/20th centuries Russia/USSR played played massive role in Bulgaria
I don't think so
It's a free market
Games like CS:GO, Apex Legends, Fortnite and more are free2play, because lootboxes exist
If people want to spend money for skins, let them do it
Absolutely
The whole world should get rid of these fucking (non-cosmetic) microtransactions
the problem is a) kids for many obvious reasons and b) people with mental gambling problems
Pathological gamblers and the easily addicted are wonderful prey for the gam(bl)ing industry's 'whale hunters'. These are direct terms used by said industry, btw, as in 'prey' and 'whales'. This isn't trust fund billionares throwing excess money away, it's erakwilled, mentally ill people whose issues are being supported and exploited by a predatory industry
The way things are going with the far right taking over, with the USA and Britain as a prime example, probably in a world war

If you're right I'll apologise for being wrong
One of our politicians went to a meeting with Trump carrying a [Billa bag] Since then the Billa bag incident has turned into a cult for the aesthetic people, such as this [lady]
Probably North Macedonia , there are like our little brother
Bulgaria and North Macedonia
It's a complicated relationship :)
Macedonia is like our little brother
We always wish the best for him but his manipulative ex wife convinced him to change his last name and turned him against us so now he cries foul when we try to remind him that we are family
Lol shout out to Bulgaria when they fought every neighbor at the same time
I've actually heard the comparison made that France and Belgium's relationship is comparable to that of Bulgaria and (North) Macedonia
But of course, even mentioning the two countries in the same sentence is how wars can begin on the Balkans lol (feel free to check r/AskBalkans to get a glimpse)
Linguistically and culturally we're extremely similar
I wouldn't say *the same*, no, but extremely similar, for a variety of reasons
And I can't remember ever having a war with (North) Macedonia
Controversy, scandal, arguments both in schollary circles, government, and among random strangers
Plenty of those
We get heated
But we've yet to actually try and murder each other on the basis of national agenda
I think
(Which is *very* rare for the Balkans)
We share a lot of culture, history, music, national heroes, etc
to the point of fights about who has the right to claim what for themselves and how one country is "stealing" them from the other
Though that is not uncommon for all of the Balkans
Literally no one calls it like that, except Romanians
Dude you guys are our brothers
I don't care what anyone says
Not rent, no
It's pretty much expected that if you have a **full-time job** (after graduating) and live with your parents you'd chip in for expenses - either covering specific bills yourself (phone, cable, internet) or helping with the total expenses (buying groceries, paying part of the electricity bill, etc
If you have a **part-time job**, even if it's a very cosy paycheck, but you're not in the career-building stage of your life (e.g: you're still in university), the only thing you'd be expected to pay is probably an errand from the store here and there
You'd only be asked to help with expenses only if your family is struggling
Likewise, parents here will bleed themselves dry to help their children financially
If the "child" has a job while living with them, it's like a milestone towards financial independence - no longer needing any allowance, handling all personal expenses alone, etc
Russian with a Turkish accent is the most hilarious and at the same time infuriating comparison I've heard
The most infuriating description I've heard was "Russian spoken with a toothache
Thank you Albania, for having such nice people who are so kind and hospitable even when you are abroad
Well regardless of what Russia has become, we still have a blood debt to the Russians for freeing us from 500 years of ottoman slavery
What exactly did we try to conquer/take from you
Come on :P y'all are already so big
Do you really need dobrudzhja
Just kidding :P
Same
That's meant to be like a thank you :P just sounds more severe, but I guess that's typical for our people
Nah you know what, Romanian is a beautiful language
I noticed we have some good ties regardless of some history
There's a street in your capital named after one of our national heroes and I bet there's more
Its how different we are that makes us so interesting and great

109th day of protests against government and prosecutor
P.M. apparently got covid and is resting at home
Information is muffled, like nothing is happening while shit is hitting the fan hard
We've been in this song and данс before

Ach, Berlin
There were strikes such as roadblocks on major roadways, crossroads, highways and city entrances
Capital centre is blocked almost every night
Interestingly emough, police are also protesting, demanding higher salaries

I gotta tell you the only thing the Academy of arts speciazes in is producing alcoholics
Other than SU Kliment Ohridski, no universities even feature in QS international ranking, I wouldn't really say higher education is particularly prestigious in Bulgaria
Pretty much any degree from a 3rd tier university anywhere in Western Europe is praised more than whatever education you can get in Bulgaria
Even SU has significant problems in some faculties
Isn't that the case for most artists
I once heard  Gredi Assa telling a story about some models arriving on the entrance exam for "Fashion" and he asked them: "Where are your pencils, ladies
" and they replied: "But we came here to strut the runway"
True, but an architecture degree from UASG will mean more to any employer than an architectural degree from Varnenski Svoboden
I would politely dissagree
" Pretty much any degree from a 3rd tier university anywhere in Western Europe is praised more than whatever education you can get in Bulgaria " - definitely not true, at least not for third tier
First tier - yes, second tier - maybe in some cases
But yeah, it's not very prestigious
But I honestly like that, I wouldn't want it to be like with high schools, where people obsess over getting into "elite schools"
Oh boy the things I've seen
There used to be a sculpture classroom that was basically treated as a pub
We'd buy like 6-10 liters of beer and spend the whole day drinking and no one even bothered hiding the bottles
You could smoke almost everywhere
I've seen teachers leaving the bathrooms reeking of weed
And I can hardly imagine the things I haven't seen
[Here] is the data about UASG and [here] about Varna regarding architecture degrees
As you can see from the official data from our ministry of education, the difference is not really that much - 70% graduated from UASG end up working in the sector compared to 63% from Varna
The salaries from Varna graduates are pretty much the same, even slightly higher
Yes, UASG is slightly better but if the difference from the bottom of the list to the top of the list is only the difference between 63% employment and 70% employment, is it really that meaningful to employers
In my company, the management doesn't make a difference between universities abroad
It's pretty much "OMG this person studied abroad, let's call him for an interview
". The university doesn't really matter
I really don't think this is unique to my company either
I also studied abroad and no one ever questioned the quality of my unversity, people always say "you went abroad, obviously your education is much better". I actually agree that it is better but people rarely put it to a test which I find weird
Ohh, can I ask what field you're in and your major
I work in the field of IT, major is also from the field
Oh shit
I may become your colleague :D
If it weren't for the Russians it would just be another region of Romania along with Transnistria
From my limited view both sides would like that to happen, but y'know
well, none of your neighbors have Tatratea
I never remember those two apart
Yeah, I know
It wasn't a dig at the Moldovan identity
Just saying they seem way more friendly and brotherly compared to, for example, our relations with N.Macedonia
Formal speak to family is considered very offensive
About 43 on that corruption index, I honestly expected worse
It's pretty bad, especially the justice system, which is why it's so difficult to hold officials accountable, despite all the petitions, protests and journalist investigations in the world
very corrupt
Let's say that we are the most corrupted country in Europe
Between 0 (Iceland) and 10 Russia/Turkey, we're prolly a solid 6
For me it has to be [this] It's a harvest song from Thrace
Very haunting
Edit: Alternate [link]
For me it has to be something from Pancho Vladigerov - the most influential Bulgarian composer, and the one that managed to combine best our traditional folk music with classical one
[Pancho Vladigerov - Vardar - Bulgarian Rhapsody] is the most majestic and widely loved one
[Pancho Vladigerov - Op
36 No
4 Improvisation] for a more calmer, contained one, a personal favorite
edit: Actually the biggest crowd favorite here:
["Oblache le byalo"] - has numerous versions by many artists, popular among everyone probably
Think "Auld Lang Syne" popularity
Oh yeah, Yann Tiersen
This guy is a national treasure of yours
Nah I think it's [this]
I prefer [this] but yours cool too
Beautiful :')
She is wonderful, thank you
Sandu Ciorba is a legend, I don't care what anyone says
[another favorite]
If someone can answer why his hair always looks like he just dipped it in bacon grease though that would be awesome
I am ... confused
Tavener
I bawl my eyes out every time when I watch Children of Men
Ummm, I think you mean [this]
Idk how these videos came out of such a homophobic country lmao
That one is great too
I found it hard to pick one since there are so many amazing songs
Sorry, someone posted another one, try [this]
Why not try our local version for double the confusion triple the cringe
You win
i dont know how to beat this one
kakoi tui be brat
Of course no one can beat such peak artistic excellence
Тоя в началото като се обърна с гипсираната ръка и разбрах че предстои нещо много специално
Because of school/uni, I live in a big city on a semi-permanent basis(vacations and quarantine notwithstanding) and it's alright
I can have walks more than 10 minutes long and there are a lot more stores to waste my time in
London - Over crowded , ugly , overpriced and life is very rushed its like everyone is in a hurry ... because they always are also have to travel alot to find a decent holiday spot, benefits include alot of money opportunities but the taxes and rent will take any money you make anyway
Plovdiv - Very chill and relaxed, beautiful city , close to any holiday destinations from Greece to the Black sea or a mountain holiday however wages are disgustingly low unless you have a very high education but at the same time everything is cheap anyway
Fairly cheap compared to zone 1 or compared to other european countries because i mean £12 at lets say Nandos for half a chicken with chips isnt exactly worth it but its cheap for London standards
North Macedonia
Obviously the country exists, but because for a big chunk of time in the past it was a part of Bulgaria and it's full of ethnic Bulgarians, the joke is that there's no such thing as a country (North) Macedonia
Perhaps this will shine some light on why The Balkans are a hot zone
So much territory changed hands between the years that everyone can claim anything here
I hope that this post will be taken as humorous and not insulting
**Bulgar (pre-Christian) names:** Kubrat, Asparukh, Kormesiy, Kormisosh, Vineh, Telets, Sabin, Umor, Toktu, Pagan, Kardam, Malamir, Saver, Tervel, Telerig, Presian, Omurtag, Krum, Boris, Rasate
**Christian names:** Vladimir, Simeon, Samuil, Presiyan, Dobromir, Kaloyan, Asen, Petar, Konstantin, Ivan, Ivaylo, Koloman, Georgi, Shishman, Yoan, Smilets, Mihail, Georgi, Aleksandar
**Female names - royal consorts and female sebastocratic rulers:** Desislava, Elena, Petritsa, Irina, Anastasiya, Mariya, Mariya Survuvul, Agata, Yakvinta, Anna, Kira, Teodora, Yoanna, Eleonora, Margarita
Alexander, Ferdinand, Boris, Simeon, only considering more recent history
OP also mentioned in a comment that it can be a ruler born on the territory of the present day state (from a predecessor state)
So you can add the Thrace-born Roman emperor Galerius and Odrysian king Teres
That really expands the possibilities: Orpheus, Seth, Odrys etc
Boris, Krum, Asparukh, Presian and Tervel are still popular to this day
The rest
not so much, but they are very epic indeed
We have a cold soup called tarator - it consists of yoghurt, cucumbers, garlic, salt, dill and maybe walnuts
The debate is about whether the cucumber should be grated or cubed
I personally belong to the grated gang - not only is it faster than dicing, but the texture is also better imo
How to call small platic bags
"Plikche" vs "Torbichka" is the West-East divide that I know from where I've lived
There are also some heathens in the middle that call them "sackche", but I pay them no mind because that's preposterous - there can only be two names for it
There's also the old-fought war whether to call peppers "piperka" or "chushka"
Kebapche or Kufte (pronounced kyufte and literally means meatball)
Mayo
Haven't heard of the other kind
In my book, milk doesn't go in tea at all
It is indeed
Even better with a grated cucumber
The thing that surprised me the most after I moved from Moscow to Bulgaria is when I lived in Russia everything around was in Russian
Settings on a washing machine
In Russian
Instructions on a shampoo bottle
Russian
List of ingridients on food package
Russian
Here it can be any random european language - german, greek, polish, whatever
They just slap shitty unreadable piece of paper with Bulgarian translation on it and call it day
My washing mashine settings are french
I don't speak any french and never thought that it is a thing that you need to check for before buying
Manual - yes, I'm taking about text on the surface on electronics
I had to goole wtf is "repassage facile", lol
We have quite some songs that might fit some of the description in the OP, but it’s hard to think of a single example of a song that was as massive as Despacito
I guess in recent years this is a good candidate:
[Krisko feat
Slavi Trifonov - Gleday kak se pravi]
2 of the biggest names in Bulgarian music collaborating, a really catchy song and to top it off, a mini dance craze, as well
Was everywhere in 2018
In the pre-digital era, I think this stands out:
[Ivana - Neshto netipichno]
I don’t think there’s a single Bulgarian who cannot sing along to at least the chorus (even though I’m sure many are ashamed to admit it), and I’m I’m talking from toddlers to retirees
Easily remains one of the biggest songs of this century here
Yeah, that was the same in Bulgaria with that song
It was everywhere, even people who don’t actively listen to music were talking about it
Luda po tebe is definitely on the same level as Neshto netipichno, it’s an evengreen
Hayde, opa doesn’t come close tho, it’s not even among the biggest hits of Andrea here
Well, Ukrainian being a Slavic language certainly helps, some of the words are identical to Bulgarian, but overall it’s a difficult language to get when you have to exposure to it (it’s no Serbian or Russian, with which Bulgarians are way more familiar)
The message definitely wasn’t lost, tho, the video made it pretty clear, too
These bridges, funded with EU money, cost 134000 €.
Well, you can see everywhere some projects that look amazing like some stadiums and sports centres, but it takes about centuries and millions of years to be made
And lack of money
It's sad to see
M5 in Istanbul is 100% automatic and it runs really well
Maybe they can hire Mitsubishi/CAF to build a good automation
Read russian
Cyrillic ain't russian
Of course
And you can't be mad about it
It's one of the few truly great things Bulgarian, I ain't about to just let it pass and be falsely known as someone else's. Toxic nationalism is bad, but this is not the case here
It's just as ignorant as americans saying they invented pizza
You already said what it means in English, then
You literally edited your comment to transliterate "мир". Transliterate, not translate
From one alphabet to another, not from one language to another
From cyrillic to latin, not from russian to "mir".
I guess I noticed an "issue" before looking for one
Have a nice day
We have it in Bulgarian and it's more like the one who brightens the world
Maybe not many people know, but the very first computer was created in Bulgaria from a guy by the name of John Atanasov
I see a Romanian here also claiming insulin
It was invented in the USA by an American, who had Bulgarian father
Yes, excuse me
You're right
Meant by a bulgarian not in Bulgaria, sorry
Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, Assassin's Creed Rogue, Tropico 3-5, Surviving Mars, Phoenix Point and Total War Saga: Troy
Also S.T.A.L.K.E.R is one of my favourite games
Looking forward to S.T.A.L.K.E.R 2
Tropico 3, 4 and 5 were developed by Haemimont Games and are pretty popular
They also made Surviving Mars, which also did pretty well
Assassin's Creed Liberation and Rogue were developed by Ubisoft Sofia
And I just found out that Total War Saga: Troy, which just came out recently was developed in Bulgaria by Creative Assembly Sofia
Still, no Bulgarian publishers
Only developers
But it still works for me
I've been playing Witcher 3 for days now and the one thing I don't like about it is Gwent
I wish I could just get all of those Gwent missions to just move to the failed list and get out of the way
Which Assassin's Creed
There's been a ton of them and I know the first one (called just "Assassin's Creed") was from Ubi's Montreal studios
Please watch it with subtitles and not dubbed
I would like to thank Greece and Turkey for managing their tourism way better than us (Bulgaria)
In this context we're very, very stupid
All of my friends who went to Greece or Turkey on a holiday had a  great time
I'd like to thank Romania and Greece for having our backs in terms of international politics when we need them
Cheers, mates
I hope the Craiova Group can prosper together
Err
I'd like to thank the black sea for always being our coast sea
I want to thank all our neighbours for trying to forget our history and live in peace+food
How about Switzerland
I guess no one remembers the relocations of bulgarians out of southern Thrace anymore
It's not very popular, but as far as I know, it's unique for Bulgaria
It's called [Етър] (Etar) and it's basically caramel flavoursed soda drink
Before Coca Cola and Pepsi became ubiquitous and before new brands of drinks were established, the main flavours of drinks were lemonade, blueberry and etar
The alcoholic drinks we share with the rest of the Balkans - the rakia, the wine etc
Not at all
Many old (and a not-insignificant number of young) people openly romanticise our communist past, completely disregarding the concentration camps, indoctrination, the complete Soviet dominance over our affairs and the fact that bananas were considered a luxury
Even the more controversial parts of the Regime (like the attempt to ethnically cleanse the 13% of the population of Turkish descent) are quite often justified by communist nostalgists, if not straight-up praised
Well, mate, as far as I know, there are no games translated in Bulgarian
Games are always played best in their original language
If it's English (as is true for most), I play in English
If it's another language, I play in that language with subtitles
I think your question would be better about films/TV series
Never seen a "Bulgarian" option available but I have played the Sims in French and Russian at times, for practice's sake - it doesn't risk me fucking up the storyline or not understanding something important quite as much as an RPG would
Besides that exception, always English - if I can read a book in its original text, I would
Same goes for video games
I'd never live to see a decent translation to Bulgarian, except maybe if I do it myself
Either way, it loses something and I think translations for games are spoiling people in a way
And depriving them of the original experience
Minecraft is translated into bulgarian but its annoying when you have to search for an item and you have to change your keyboard to bulgarian and change it back to english for the commands or to speak if you are in english speaking server
Thats why i play on English even though my language is available
Some people put their games and lots of other things like TVs,Car menus etc in Russian so they can understand it better especially older peoples who learned russian
I once got diablo 2 in only French
I was so fucking angry
Pretty much the same way - dumb, backwards and populist oligarch voter base
This is the first time I have seen or heard about it
In recent years, i think in the Burgas Airport al qaeda made an anti-zionism terrorist attack
This happened back in 2012, only seven people died but i cant remember anything else, except back in 1925 when the bulgarian communist party blew up a church and killed 200 people and injured 500
Also, all of my prayers and thoughts go to the Lebanese people and the ones affected by it
The [2008 Chelopechene explosions] has to be there as well - a massive explosion just 10km away from the center of the capital Sofia
It obliterated a military depot with a total of 1,494 tonnes of ageing artillery shells, rocket propelled grenades, depth charges, hand grenades and other explosives
Thankfully only 3 people were injured, as it happened in the early hours of the morning and said depot was not in active use, just used as storage for the old materials
OK here we go:
NM - let's just get rich first and stop the bleeding of our people
We deserve to have honorable lives
Romania - we respect the will of the Romanians and I must say you've pushed me to set the bar high when it comes to fighting corruption
Netherlands - thank you for the education, much more in life than in knowledge
The structure and order in your country has inspired me to bring some of that here
Greece - I hope we can extend our arms even further than today and create common history positively more often
Last poll I saw, on the question "which country you like the most" something like 45% of the asked people had picked Romania as their first choice
So yeah that's good results I guess
Happy Martisor btw
If you can read this, you are too old to drink milk
We need a Korova milk bar
I am vegan, but even before that i wasn't a huge fan of milk
Ah, the toddlers these days
They first learn to write, than read
В гъза на географията. In geography's ass
We say 'in the ass of geography'
Regarding a specific place, I've heard Zanzibar, bacause it no longer exists as a country like before
But it is very rarely used
На майка си в гъзо/На майка си в путката - In its mother's ass/pussy
"Na maika si putkata" or as you gentlemen would know it "at its mother's privates"
Bulgarians eat snails too
Frogs I do not know
Lol try Georgian
You sold since of the archives to us
Really
That would actually be pretty great
Because on average our streets are narrow and can’t feed a building that big
Also, because they are ugly, compared to 100+ years old buildings and people don’t like the contrast
Streets in a lot cities are made hundreds of years before skyscrapers existed,  they are narrow and not very straight, so it would be very hard to build a building as huge as a skyscraper all also they are ugly and stand out way too much for an old city center with old beautiful buildings
In Sofia in particular, there is regulation about how tall a building should be
This thing was made to preserve the view of Vitosha mountain as it's the most precious view for every citizen in the city
Yes there are skyscrapers but they don't overshadow the look of the mountain
I am not sure but i think it was "gotov ili ne , az idvam". Havent played the game in years so i am not 100% if that was the phrase
Готов или не идвам аз
Готов или не, аз идвам!
Готов или не, аз идвам
Bulgarian
***"Готов или не, идвам!"*** Which is closer to ***"Ready or not, I'm coming"*** but they are basically the same thing so
Готов или не, аз идвам or Готов или не, ето ме, идвам OR Готов или не, идвам!
We don't have 3 ways to say it, it's just how i think it's possible to say it
The three ways of saying it are almost the same, but have a slight difference
it means the same thing as the title asks for, ready or not here i come
Oh my god are you kidding
So amazing i didn't know that
лопата in bulgarian too :DD
Well, there is a community of Bessarabian Bulgarians in Moldova
They speak similar to our Bulgarian and honestly they are so cute when they speak it and I feel somewhat proud when I hear their version of the same language
I don't understand how Romanians always drive like they are in race
Even their truckdrivers in the mountains
I just can't understand it
Greece: How can you have so beautiful cities and yet all your buildings are covered in graffiti
Turkey: For a Muslim country you really are selling a lot of alcohol
Also why when you buy alcohol you put it in newspaper or some kind of paper to hide it
Also why are you following a dictator who led your country to misery
I remember going there for example in 2011 and it was so modernized everything and people were very friendly and approachable especially with women, now I am afraid to go there without my mom or my man(and I am in my mid 20s)
Macedonia: Why do you hate us
I know it's politics but just why
Also pls don't take so seriously our jokes about you and how we want your lands
I think it's more the idea that you have your vacation in another country
There are many Bulgarians that dislike our beaches and they like to go to Greece, Turkey some to Romania I have heard
Also I believe the industry and the government are trying to attract more foreign tourists because the Bulgarian will never pay 10-15 euros for umbrella and sun bed (if this is how it is called) on a beach that is suppose to be free for everyone
We drive the same way though
Probably, just that what I have noticed about the Romanian drivers
Oh that is my favorite, then he rides right behind me very close like it's going to make me drive faster
* We call scotch tape "tikso" after the Tixo brand;
* We call diapers "pampersi" after the Pampers brand;
* We call dishwashing liquid "vero" after the Vero brand;
* We call copying machines "kseroksi" after the Xerox brand;
* We call SUVs and 4x4 vehicles "dzhipove" after the Jeep brand;
* We call hot tubs "dzhakuzita" after the Jacuzzi brand
Most of these brand names didn't really became words for the producrts due to popularity, but because they were the first brands to offer said product in Bulgaria
There's many but I can only think of one right now - Ксерокс (kseroks/Xerox) for photocopier - it's a word we use more than "Копирна машина" (copying machine), because as you might guess, Xerox is the first and most popular brand for those here
We use it even for other brands of photocopying machines
There's also a verb with it, although it's (fortunately) not as common - Може ли да направиш Ксерокс на този лист? - "Can you make a Xerox of this paper sheet
Edit: other examples I can think of right now are Jeep and Pampers
Yup - the "provintsiya". The dreaded word describing everything beyond Sofia's Ring Road
I moved to Germany after I got my bachelor's degree back home
Was doing language course for a hole year (9:00 to 13:00 every weekday) and there was another bulgarian girl
We both thought it was safe to be our R-rated selfs and talk shit all day long
Well the year goes by and I'm doing my oral exam
We finish up and one of our reachers calls me up and starts to talk to me in bulgarian as if she was never a german teacher  ... I wished for instant death, but I could just stay  there ... get super red and have a blank stare in my face
Unsurprising, but weird: Гадже (*gadzhe*, dzh sound like in judge) is established Bulgarian slang for boyfriend or girlfriend, and it comes from the Romani word for "non-Roma person". No comment on how it probably ended up that way
Бъбрек, бюрек, чаршаф и чорапи are also used in Bulgarian, but бакър, пешкир and челик are considered archaic/old-fashined and you can only hear them out of the mouths of old people (or peasants, which is almost synonymous)
*Shubler*, *shaiba*, *shina*, *shur* and *shantsa* (ski jumping thing) are also used in Bulgarian
We probably got them from German in the same time period
> шлагбаум
Also, don't forget штраф and вокзал.
Ковчег means coffin in modern Bulgarian, but the older meaning can be seen in the diminutive ковчеже (small money chest, mainly seen in pirate movies) and ковчежник (treasurer of an organisation)
>  I'm pretty certain that it's either a Latin loan or a proto-Indo-European cognate
My *Dictionary of Foreign Words in the Bulgarian Language* says it was borrowed from the French *plage*, which in turn comes from the Italian *piaggia*.
Were they *ahem* hungry
Fairly popular among young people
On the other hand, most adults above 40 years old think that cannabis is as bad as heroine while they drink spirits every evening
A lot of hypocrites here
Yep
Biggest problem is that the majority of the medical community is among those adults, too
And as a result, weed is still criminalised and heavily stigmatised but nobody really bats an eye at *cigarettes*, even if the person smoking them is like 14
Its really easy to find weed if you search for it even in smaller towns such as mine which has around 70-80k population but that doesn't change the fact that majority of people here think that weed is a demonic creature
Even intelligent people who are a bit older have little to no information about the pros and cons of cannabis
I would say that countries in Eastern Europe percieve weed in a similar way
Most youngsters have tried at least once and most adults around middle age and above see it as as the worst thing ever
I mean they are right, if you are serious about sports best to stay away from weed and alcohol
We use the Cyrillic - it has a letter for every sound, so there is no variations in spellings
There are names that have variations tho:
* Tsvetlin(a)
* Tsvetelin(a)
* Tsvetoslav(a)
* Tsvetlomir(a)
* Svetlin(a)
* Svetomir(a)
* Svetomil(a)
* Svetlomir(a)
* Svetloslav(a)
* Svetlomir(a)
* Yoan(a)
* Yovan(a)
* Ivan(a)
* Dragomir(a)
* Dragoslav(a)
* Dobromir(a)
* Dobroslav(a)
And so on
Only rarely, Bulgarian is too much of a phonetic language
Whether a name is spelled with я (ya) or a (Kristiyan/Kristian), or with a single/double n (Ana/Anna)
That's about it
Yes because in Croatian (and all Slavic languages that use the Latin alphabet) the letter C makes the sound of the German letter Z, not K.
As a Bulgarian who did something similar, I studied in the Netherlands are recently came back home
I work online now and make a very decent chunk of money out of my education
Hoping to start a business soon
I spent most of 2019 living in Germany and Austria
I liked both but Austria is nicer tbh
In Russian koleja is still used for these grooves
And allthough usual railroads are "iron road", "zheleznaya doroga", narrow gauge is uzkokolejka - narrow grooves
I wouldn't say for miles and miles
But a dozen kilometres yes
Yes, the mountains, but only I think Strandzha, the Rhodopes and Stara Planina the others have a lot of tourists
Bulgaria
Yes
Netherlands where I reside
Everything is both populated and synthetic
Wildernis hasn't existed here since the 1600s
It wouldn't be controversial if they were just born abroad, but if they had longstanding connection with another country, it would definitely be controversial
For example, Sergei Stanishev, a former prime minister who was born in Kherson (today in Ukraine, then in the USSR), got a lot of flak for retaining Russian citizenship and not even acquiring Bulgarian citizenship until he was thirty
He was accused of not taking Bulgarian citizenship to avoid military service
And of course the president of Bulgaria must be a Bulgarian citizen by birth
Which currently means at least one of parent must be a Bulgarian citizen, but in earlier times the requirements were stricter
For example, Georgi Pirinski was a candidate for president in 1996, until the Constitutional court ruled him ineligible, because at the time (1948) those born abroad were Bulgarian citizens by birth either if both of their parents were Bulgarian citizens or they did not gain another citizenship by birth
And Pirinski, being born in the US with a Bulgarian father and a Slovenian mother was out of luck
Well, our former head of states and kings/tsars have been born in different countries and they have done decent jobs, so I think the majority will like him/her
Small independent ones, whose journalists, editors and owners get beat  in the streets, have their card set on fire etc
Oldest friend of Bulgaria
I guess Romania
Why I don't really know
Probably because they started out under our empire until we lost dominion over those areas
Only one, when my ancestors came there was only the Byzantium Empire (who were our enemies till the Ottomans came, and then the Ottomans became our enemy) and some slavs who are our only friends
Well you freed us
But I wouldn't call it friends, more like friendly
We just have a blood-debt to you guys
You just weren't the nicest in history to us so that's why we're friendly, not superfriends
Yes
That's what our sense of humour is like
Racist joke's? Yes
Sexism
Yes
Jewish jokes
Yes
Sarcastic ones
Yes
Joking about sex
Yes
Is it raw, rude sex humour
He'll, yeah
Jokes about extended family
Prejudice
Yes, yes, and yes to jokes about stupid superiority over other nations which are in fact at our expense
You name it - we approve of it
Yes
Lol we have those people in the Balkans too
Same, Romanian bro
Bulgaria:During the comunist period the country was better and they ruined the country
Large plastic bags from BILLA
It's hard to explain
our entire government is a fucking meme
Yes because what ever Merkel says Boyko will follow, also Macedonia and Serbia because of Macedonia's bullshit
Well at least in the Balkans it's very common
Bulgaria, parliament parties:
BSP - largely unreformed communists
Economically left (not really far left); socially they would be mildly progressive on paper but the leaders are extremely conservative (nationalistic, anti-lbgt, anti-refugees)
EU MEPs do not follow PES in votes
Mixed bag regarding EU integration and Russia
DPS - formally liberal, in practice a mafia owned party that collects a lot of Turkish minority vote through scaremongering
Member of ALDE, EU MEPs vote accordingly
Part of almost every government in the last few decades
GERB - center right populists, ruling in the last 11 years, during which country fell to worst ratings for corruption and press freedom, economic growth mostly halted
Formally strong pro EU, at least as long as they receive EU money
Mildly socially conservative, centrist economically
Volya - single personality, single issue (cheap fuel
) right wing populists
Mostly political bargainer without own agenda
United Patriots (VMRO + Attack, I think they split lately) - far right, with visible traits of fascism
Obviously extremely socially conservative, largely interventionallistic economically
Part of government
Anti EU, very pro Russia
Outside of parliament but notable:
Democratic Bulgaria - coalition that claims to be liberal but main component is DSB, Christian right party
Minor party is Da BG, that claims to be liberal, and The Greens, who are tiny and claim to be green
Member of EPP (!), the only MEP consistently votes oppositely to the election platform  that sent him (but in accordance with his native DSB, I guess)
To answer the last question in the original post - no, I don't really feel there is a choice among Bulgarian political parties that matches my views enough to say I support them
When I vote, it's mostly the least bad choice
Who would you say is the least bad choice right now
If elections were today, personally, I'd vote for "Yes, Bulgaria
" even though I don't like all the parties in their coalition
Maybe if "Save Sofia" makes a political party for the next elections, they'd get my vote
Tsar's party was NDSV (note that I am just transliterating, not translating the abbreviations)
It ruled in the beginning of the millennium, after that had worse result and participated in coalition with BSP and then fell out the parliament and became largely irrelevant (Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha had retired by this time)
Policies were largely liberal-centrist, not without major corruption scandals
Curious facts: Simeon II was one of two monarchs in history to be later democratically elected as head of government and he is last living person who bore the title tsar
The first one was Simeon I of Bulgaria, in 912
I have voted for Reformers / Democratic Bulgaria  on all partisan elections since they exist and have been disappointed every single time
Probably still the least bad choice, but it is getting harder to pick
I sometimes ride the train to my town even though driving is faster and sometimes even cheaper (when with passengers), I just really like trains and want to give the national railway company a few more rides to that destination to make sure they don't close the route
**Almost everybody:**
Personal name + Father's name + Father's Family name
**People whose father's don't recognise them:**
Personal name + Mother's name + Mother's family name
Patronymic and family names end with -ov, -ev, -ski for males and -ova, -eva, -ska for females, while the very rare -ich is used for both genders
Matronymic names are build with the suffixes -in for males and -ina for females
**Examples:**
|Name example|Translation|
|Ivaylo Krumov Asparuhov |Ivaylo, son of Krum of the family of Asparuh |
|Desislava Peycheva Dimitrova|Desislava, daughter of Peyko of the family of Dimitar|
|Boris Stoynev Zografski|Boris, son of Stoyno of the family of the  Zograf (church painter)
-ski and -ki suffixes are often used for family names
designating professions (ex
Smith)|
|Parvan Penkin Ivanov|Parvan, son of Penka of the family of Ivan|
|Albena Marinkina Yavorova|Albena, daughter of Marinka of the family of Yavor|
Bulgarian here
We have a first name, father's name as a middle one, and a family name from the dad's side again
In the case of a single mother, the kid gets it's middle and last name from her
Our middle and last names usually end in -ov for men, -ova for women
Since fairly recently, some parents have started giving two first names to their offspring
I think if you want to do that, they have to be hyphenated, for example Maria-Magdalena
One given name, one paternal name (the name of your father + "оv/ova" suffix), and a surname (either the name of your paternal grandfather +"ov/ova" suffix or your father's surname, but not both)
First name - just a regular first name
Middle/Father's name - The name of your father, usually ending in -ов (-ov) (or even an -a appended)
Last/Family name - The name of the family, sometimes a profession or a name of an ancestor
ends in -ов, -ова, -ски or -ска, although the latter 2 are more rare
Marriage name (I don't know how to call it) - It's optional and it's appended to the last name using a dash
It's only for when women get married and it's the last name of their partner
I'd add that **-ski/ska** could also be applied to toponymic names, **e.g:** Ohridski (of Ohrid), Sofiyska (of Sofia), etc
though I haven't seen these last names applied often outside of history or religion
Also the Armenian disapora here is exempt from changing their last name to end in a gendered way, as they usually end with **-yan/ian** which I find pretty interesting, as they still fit in pretty well with our system, as that's just their version of -ov/a, -ev/a, etc
I believe you could (or at least back in the day, prior to the 90s) use your patronym instead of your family name
I've met quite a few people in their 50s who do this, unless absolutely necessary, though currently if anyone used that it'd be pretty weird and probably considered incorrect information
I don't know about your family but I find it interesting that, for a lot of people here, last names are actually a pretty new invention, from the last hundred years or so
The last name is usually a patronym of an older generation, often the first name of the person's grandparent
I find it very entertaining how vastly different American Anglo-Saxons' names are, compared to actual Brits
Like obviously you'd get some of the same "normal" names there but then there's names that just sound *super* American
They don't allow non-hyphenated but if you use a hyphen, it's technically one-word-not-two-or-more
It's more common for girls (Anna-Maria, Teodora-Luisa, etc) but it's gained momentum for boys, too (along the lines of Asparuh-Aleksandar, Vladimir-Asen
It's a bit odd for when foreigners get documents here because middle names don't exist here - we only have patronyms
So if someone gets a Bulgarian ID issued and their middle name is like, Claire or whatever, it just says "Father's name: Claire" and I think that's pretty funny
I get the same feeling when I hear "Slavic" names on American TV haha, it just feels wrong (cause it is wrong, in *our* languages and naming systems but not in English)
Kind of, yeah
I kind of thought Americans are likelier to do that, in addition to spelling some "conventional" names in more *kreatyve* ways (like the 10 thousand different ways to spell Katherine and it's variants)
Being a slave, probably
People think we speak Russian , the cyrillic alphabet is made in Russia or we are part of Russia
That's hilarious
You have come across some less educated fellow Bulgarians
It is not a common thing to assume that people eat dogs in Serbia
Tell me more about embarrassing moments
Last summer a 20-year old hacker has managed to attack our NRA register and get the data of around 5 million citizens only to show how poor the national cyber security systems are
[2019 Bulgaria revenue agency hack – Wikipedia]
Similar thing happened to our Commercial register this summer
Nothing more to add
A couple of years ago
I can tell you from experience that government agencies in Bulgaria use XP computers today
"Такова" in informal/slang/dialect language it has an infinite amount of meanings
It's mostly used when you forget the proper word for something
Apparently we're the vast minority here, but we don't. I remember we had something like that in kindergarten and maybe some classes in history where we've discussed some religion, but outside the very few religious schools - no, no religion classes in public schools
edit: I was reminded by other comments about the existence of the ethics classes, however this is taught in the same vein as philosophy, psychology etc
so it's not really religion-centered
Tell him Eastern Europe is a no go zone
Just go through some old Yurop vs Yank posts and pick whatever ludicrous claim any side beleived about the other
Tell him that virtually everything he hears is sarcasm/has the opposite meaning
Tell him that there is a somewhat new and only sometimes used common european language, just with heavy dialects (dutch is germanic, so I think that might be beleivable)
Everything has to be eaten by hand if doing so is even remotely possible (this is actually somewhat true for a fair few)
We are all *really* jealous of america and admire/worship it constanly
Everybody is liberal/progressive beyond imagination
You kiss instead of shaking hands, and have to bow to people who service you (cashiers to policemen)
AND MAKE SURE TO UPDATE US ON HOW IT GOES
Simpler way to put it is to tell him that there is a common european language, just with heavy dialects
Considering he'll just be in the netherlands and germany, that seems somewhat beleivable
I mean full-blown frenching any random stranger you would've otherwise shaken your hands with
Plovdiv
It’s far superior in every way - it’s more central than Sofia ended up to be after the wars
It’s already boasting better infrastructure and cultural life and it’s on a river
>It’s already boasting better infrastructure and cultural life
One must be careful about allowing wishful thinking to outweigh reality
>and it’s on a river
Which is non-navigable and whose main effect is to worsen the local climate - already worse than Sofia
>One must be careful about allowing wishful thinking to outweigh reality
The pedestrian infrastructure in the centre of the city is superior than anything Sofia can offer, Plovdiv is one of the few cities that has if not perfect, somewhat coherent cycling infrastructure etc
Good for the city administration to improve to pedestrian and cycling infrastructure, since with the decline of public transport, the Plovdiv citizens certainly need an alternative
Well someone has to be the black sheep, and we fit that role pretty well
Our geographic position is important for trade, though
Cheap labour and not so high taxes, but it is also a money pit
So I'm not sure
Our healthcare was partially privatised in the early 90s which made it far more expensive
Every citizen is covered for lots of things and state and municipal hospitals are affordable but they are expected to turn a profit which means they are critically underfunded and the quality of care is very weak
A typical fix for them is to rent out parts of their buildings to private clinics, so they can make some money
The state negotiates medicine prices and pays for them entirely for most chronic conditions, children and the elderly
The system has many problems and adopting many of the American “business first” concepts of healthcare was a stupid idea
We are a rapidly ageing nation, so we need serious reforms in our healthcare
A single payer NHS type a deal will be far superior in my mind, if we manage to reform the sector
The service nowadays is engulfed in corruption because if you pay the right person, your chances to receive higher quality treatment are higher
Those that can afford private hospitals have no issues - they only pay the difference between what they are entitled to via their state health coverage and what the hospitals bill you
The state is putting a price ceiling on most things tho, so there are no absurdly expensive procedures like in the US
But the lack of funding for highly specialised procedures usually means, people suffering from rare conditions have to go and receive treatment abroad - usually Germany or Israel
Dutch system (where I live now) sucks a big one
Even if you learned to read Cyrillic, it wouldn't make much difference if you didn't study the languages
All languages can be written in all alphabets, for example:
"Da uchish ezitsi e prekrasno i shte se radvam da nauchish moya ezik"
is a sentence in Bulgarian but written in Latin
It means "Studying languages is wonderful and I would be glad if you learned my language". It probably doesn't make any sense to you, even if you can read it, because it is written in Latin
SBCM and Bulgarian are about 60% mutually intelligible, so no that surprising
The Napoleonic wars
All I know is Napoleon was some army general from Corsica and that he somehow got in power, improved the army's logistical capabilities and used a lot of fucking canons
Took over most of Europe, was then defeated by a coalition and exiled
Somehow got back and did everything all over and after Waterloo was sent to some island in the Pacific and died
Excellent summary
Also that we built a shitload of commie blocks and basically made everyone equally f-ed (except the people connected to the regime, their families, their friends, also sometimes their other friends etc
Portugal cannot into Eastern Europe then
Classes are usually 40 minutes long, and there are 10 minute breaks in between
The "big" break is about 20 minutes for lunch
Our schools typically have shifts - half the school comes in at the morning, then the other half in the afternoon, and the following semester they switch
Shifts vary by school but they're roughly the same - mine did 7:30 am to 1:30 pm, and then 1:30 pm to 7:30 pm
This doesn't apply to private schools
**Grades 1 - 4:** classes start about 1 hour after other grades'. These kids get their "big" break after their second class, and they usually don't have more than 6 classes per day
I remember having at least one day that was 5 classes - it ended faster and it was delightful
There's also an optional "zanimalnya" which is basically a "study hall" you can sign your kid up for
It literally keeps them in school, doing homework and hobbies
It's very effective for  completely exhausting your child, making sure you don't have to help them study yourself, and keeping them in school while you're at work
You can pick up your child at any time, I think
**Grades 5 - 7:** the longest break is after the third class now, not the second
These kids are too old for that "study hall" option
Typically, 6 - 7 classes a day is the norm, and now they also have shifts
**Grades 8 - 12:** your longest break is still after the third class, and your classes are now usually 7 per day, 6 if the Gods are merciful
You have no time for anything
The 20 minute break is long enough to run at full speed to the nearest café and hope you can get a sandwich, shoving mouthfuls as you stride back in time for your next class
And because my school was *infuriating*, you were **not** allowed to leave early, ever
(*Very* rare exceptions
) Not if your last class was cancelled, not if a teacher was absent and no one could replace them
This is due to some liability, wherein if a student leaves within school hours and anything happens to them, the school can be blamed
So the most effective way of dealing with it they had, even when dealing with 19 year olds, was to find a teacher to keep them supervised
This lead to people being cooped up indoors with the teacher of a subject these students don't even *have* on the curriculum
Pretty similar in Bulgaria, but first shift starts at 7:30 am usually, so second shift is done by 7:30 pm, and thus they don't mix
Sorry, I didn't phrase that right
Today(24th) is Christmas eve,  tomorrow (25) is Christmas
Today (24th of Dec) is Badni vecher or Christmas Eve
Christmas is tomorrow
We celebrate both evenings
I don't know any Germans but even I would know immediately that he is German
Sunny Beach
It's a town by the seaside which is nothing special, but it's cheap and attracts a lot of tourists, mainly Russian
Don't be ridiculous
German is easy, especially for someone from a Germanic country
Try Russian, Bulgarian or Armenian, Arabic and see what the definition of hard is
*Deutsch ist einfach
Das sage ich aus eigener Erfahrung
I'd guess Hungarian
I'm a big fan of language and linguistics in general, but, man Hungarian is a treat
We actually had a game with a few of my friends guessing what an English word would sound like in Hungarian
We weren't very good at that game
From a different point, I guess any of the Slavic languages would be a nightmare
As a native Bulgarian speaker I can't imagine anyone having to learn all the rules that are basically just guidelines
Imagine I posted Joey meme
Ach, quatsch
Without the EU I never would’ve been able to do my bachelors and masters degrees in the the UK and have the life I’ve got now at all
So yeah, pretty damn glad
Hell yeah
Some of the fruits of the (most probable source) foreign political propaganda in Bulgaria:
EU is evil
It's bad to have child protection laws and agencies, because these agencies will kidnap your kids and will send them to the Netherlands to be adopted by gay couples
There were even protests by parents
Russia is good
Putin is strong
USA is evil - they have chemtrails and haarp and shit
Technically we were alies of the Germans so I feel by proxy I can relay the story of one relative of mine
He was telling stories of the royal days when he was sent to hunt communist partizans in the woods
When they reached some part of the woods his officer told him to stop, not make a sound and that they should go back immediately
Later that officer told him he said this and didn't continue further because he noticed they were completely surrounded and there was no point in dying for nothing
Later when the communists took over and we were buddying up with the Russians, this relative went together with 500000 of his country men to fight the nazis all the way to Vienna, though he was on a detachment that only reached as far as Hungary before the war was over
I don't remember many stories sadly, because he did mumble a lot and focused a lot on specific dry strategies instead of interesting adventures
He was incredibly lucky to have been caught in the west
There's some spooky stories coming out of those gulags but not many living people
Yeah and thank goodness that Bulgaria refused to send troops to Russia due to them having freed us one generation before
Given what happened to Romanians and Italians on the Eastern front I don't think he would have survived
It's relatively good
I don't really use it but if I'm searching for a something related to Bulgaria I prefer using the Bulgarian version
Here it is normal to drink tap water, but in some cites/towns people dontdrink it because of the bad flavour/bad source
Depends on where you live i guess
Friends and family from the "outskirts" of the city drink bottled / filtrated water
I live in the center of Sofia so i drink tap water and its okay i guess, bottles would be a waste
Every time I've seen Germans and Austrians buy bottled water here, they always looked for carbonated water
One said it was because sparkling water tasted fresh and still water felt stale
Is there any other reason to it
Bulgarians usually buy still water when thirsty and drinking tap water is very common
Really
I’ve never drunk tap water in my life, actually, if we’re out of bottled, I would rather not drink even if I’m thirsty, than drink the disgusting tap water
Well I don't know where you are from, but where I am all people drink tap water it's much better than bottled one
Varna, currently living in Sofia
Never heard of anyone drinking tap water (maybe some after it’s filtrated)
I drink Sofia tap water, Varna (and everywhere near the sea) water is disgusting . All my friends drink Sofia water
In NL (the Netherlands) where I am they're setting phonetowers on fire because they're brainwashed on Facebook to believe 5G causes people to die which the government then covers up with a hoax about corona or some dumb shit like that
Either way they're setting these phonetowers on fire, which is funny because there is no 5g in the Netherlands yet
Lol
Bulgaria
Extreme poverty between the pensioners - the are lacking basic products such as yoghurt, milk and bread
After they pay utilities, many have enough money only for a slice or two of bread per week and that's it
Meat is a lux that most of them can't afford
Medicine also
Warsawo walcz
Or something
A lot of foreigners make the mistake of comparing it to Russian because of the alphabet
Big mistake
The structure and lexical complexities are very different, trying to aproach it as if they shared more than a *some* words is a sure way to learn *nothing*.
Biggest tip
Actually put **effort** into it
A lot of people get discouraged very quickly when they come here, and they just get by, usually with English or Russian
But I've seen foreigners (Austrian and Scottish, specifically) absolutely killing it, to the point I couldn't even guess they weren't native speakers
Not being afraid to fuck up and asking for help when you need it is a sure way to get better at it
All nouns have genders, all others' words genders are based on the given nouns
Verbs are fucked up, just learn the three basic tenses
Edit: this is Bulgarian, forgot to mention
Don't you guys have a thing where you just flip a word and it becomes something completely different
The weird thing is also that the letter 'c' doesn't have a unique sound to begin with
It's either pronounced as k or s.
My mom knows french and has tried to explain it me
Still can't wrap my head around it
The four freedoms of the EU are the closest that we come to a unified identity
Many children grow with the knowledge they are just as much EU citizens as they are citizens of their country
This is what a growing identity is about
We do not necessarily have a whole lot in common now,  however I believe that EU-powered developments (border opening, encouraged trans-state migration and potential mixed marriages, joint multinational ventures etc
) are already binding Europeans closer than ever and the trend is an upward one, so just give it time
We live in Europe
A functioning union that holds us accountable to certain standards
Great
A European *state*? Fuck that
>we pretty much gave up our national pride
>we as Germans are already [...] far ahead then others
Hmm
Bulgarians are not yet in the Eurozone, so we still have the hassle of currency exchange when going to Greece, but the freedom to just board a plane with nothing but your ID is something that was so alien to me prior to 2007 when we joined
My niece for example, doesn't really grasp the concept of a Bulgarian citizen, denied access to a Western European country
She doesn't remember Bulgaria prior to the EU, so for her, her Bulgarian citizenship is a one that opens Europe to her
She was born in 2003
Every young person, I've talked to, that were too little to remember life before 2007 consider other EU nationals as foreigners, but they are not as foreign as someone from outside the EU
This is what I meant by "growing identity".
Italians just refuse to believe the idea of this imaginary continent named Europe
What is even Europe
Go sell your lies to someone who is too naive to fall for it
When you forget to close the door: You are not walking through curtains
When you want to eat but your mom is in a hurry/has something else to do/can't give you anything: You ate my ears
Almost everytime
My language has a very phonetic up-to-date spelling system and everything is written almost as it sounds
Same in Bulgaria
We sometimes call it "The white house" because a lot of bathrooms used to be white in past
There are various folk songs (some of dubious authenticity) detailing different freedom fighters against the Ottomans, going all the way back to the last Tzar before the medieval kingdom was conquered
Long story short, "Turks bad".
Just New Year's Eve
For the other events we have some military parades
There is one that is marked by sounding all the emergency sirens in the country for two minutes at noon on the 2nd of June
Alright
This isn't exactly ridiculous, rather weird:
Khan Krum made a cup out of the skull of the emperor of Byzantium, who lost to him
When the Russians took Dobruja from US and gave it to the Romanians in exchange for Bessarabia
One of our king dynasties ended via castration
At one point of Russian history we asked vikings to come and rule us because even though our land is enourmous it is  completely orderless
Can we do it again please
Most can't explain what the white in our flag means
Most people know for sure that the green means nature, red means blood that has been spilled in wars, but when it comes to white most people are like
Some say it refers to freedom or peace, most just say they don't know
Many people know about how the Danes stood up for their Jews during the Holocaust but so did the Bulgarians
In fact, even though Bulgaria was aligned with the Axis powers during WWII, most of their Jewish population survived the war
To put it in layman’s terms, this was done by procrastination
Axis-allied countries were told to round up their Jews and get them ready to deport for concentration camps but members of the Bulgarian community and the Bulgarian Orthodox Church protested these orders and convinced the Tsar to delay the deportations indefinitely
The Jews in Bulgaria had a pretty bad time during the war (forced labor for men, property confiscations) but almost all of them avoided deportation and survived
Yes
Hissarya Bulgaria
The old city is surrounded by a massive fortification from the Romans
Fucking everywhere
It's actually a huge pain in the ass for builders in my city - if you want to build anything in the city center there's a big possibility that you'll dig up some roman ruins and it'll delay construction time for a couple of years
Here in Bulgaria we have a lot of them [wiki] . Even in my small town there is one of the few intakt roman bathouses [link] .
A ridiculous amount
We have whole ruin cities and everything, it's insane
Many towns here have Roman ruins, to a varying degree of preservation - many are exactly ruins, but there are also some very preserved ones
Most major cities have well preserved ruins, because they were major hubs in the past too - some started by the Romans, others continued from Thracian, Greek or even more ancient settlements
Most concentrated ruins you'll probably find in Plovdiv- [ancient Philipopolis] \- they've got Roman Theatre, Forum, Stadium, Basilica, parts of Aqueduct, villas, and other bits of pieces around town
In recent years the capital Sofia excavated and put to show in the centre its old crossroads of [Ulpia Serdica] they also have 4th century Rotunda, and some other pieces of the old town on show now
In Varna we have remains of some pretty [huge Roman Baths] (7,000 m2 - claimed to befourh largest preserved in Europe)
They might have been a bit of overreach or the town hit some rough times, because there are much smaller later thermae built near them - I guess the big ones had too much upkeep and were left without maintenance
There are also some other known ruins burried under the city (city wall, temple, etc
) but these are still left to be exhibited properly
Speaking of baths - Hisarya had pretty big ones too having mineral hotsprings -  [
And there are a lot of other Roman ruins around towns, military encampments, villas ([1] [2] two major Roman roads passed through Bulgaria and there are remains of them too - Via Militaris/Diagonalis, Via Pontica
There's also [Nicopolis ad Istrum] which has this cool tidbit about it:
> Nicopolis ad Istrum can be said to have been the birthplace of [Germanic] literary tradition
In the 4th century, the [Gothic] bishop, missionary and translator [Ulfilas] (Wulfila) obtained permission from Emperor [Constantius II] to immigrate with his flock of converts to Moesia and settle near Nicopolis ad Istrum in 347-8
[\[21\]] There, he devised the [Gothic alphabet] and oversaw the translation of the [Bible] from [Greek] to [Gothic] which was performed by a group of scholars
[\[22\]]
[The Red Church near Perushtitsa] \- of late Roman, early Byzantine origin
And many many more, I could go on for ages - all worth seeing or at least taking up the ruins and daydreaming how much more important and busy these places were in Antiquity
Lol, where are you - Varna, Plovdiv, Sofia
Although basically every big city here had a Roman settlement once, though some are even much older than that
[Azis - Sen Trope] I'm ashamed to admit that I find it catchy
It's a bad song which I despise, as well as the artist, but god damn I can't help myself but listen to it when I'm bored, it's unironically catchy
I guess that's what happens when your friends jokingly introduce you to such music and then listen to it nonstop with you ""for the lols"" huh
We have more beautiful women than most of the world
I haven’t had this case but an acquaintance of mine said he had an online friend for a few months or years and the two didn’t know the other was Bulgarian till they were playing a game and after a loss my acquaintance cursed in Bulgarian
Years is probably a bit of an exaggeration
We’re talking like 1 or 2 years tops
Packages here must be delivered and signed off
If there's no one at the address, most delivery companies just return the package at the warehouse, give the client a call and arange either a new address or new delivery date
Most people have their stuff delivered to a delivery company branch office near their home and pick their stuff from there
Your "ı" makes the same sound as the letter "ъ" in Bulgarian, which isn't present in English
Also, if I'm not mistaken, that's similar to â and ă in Romanian but don't quote me on that
Most things in the service industry, from food to movie tickets
Everything
Reading all the comments from neighbouring countries makes me feel as if i live elsewhere
I can no longer be sure whether our salaries are absurdly low or food prices are abnormally high+not the same quality, lol
Same
I personally haven't been to Romania so i decided to check salaries
The data that shows up is from July 2019
Minimum salary in Romania is 446
02€ per month versus 286
33€ per month for Bulgaria
I don't know products prices in Romania but looking at ours we get worse quality but expensive foods here
And prices are only going up
As for living standards I'd say that the average Bulgarian lives poorly and i don't even want to get to the point with pensioners
The funniest part is how things are with the covid-19 panic going on rn
We ran out of basic stuff in the matter of days and doctors decide to quit their jobs because of bad working conditions (we have under 10 proven cases of infected)
As i said i haven't been to Romania but from what i see here, I'd assume that Bulgaria and Romania don't have the same living standards
Hell yeah I do
I love rain in general tbh
Salmon snake is an amazing word to have
Здравей, казвам\* се\*\* Джон, удоволствие е да се\*\* запознаем. Откъде си?
Hello, say myself John, pleasure is to ourselves meet
From where are you
\*казвам = say, but казвам се = I am called
If I translate each word individually, as is OP's idea, казвам would be just say
\*\*these are untranslatable in English, they don't have short forms of reflexive pronouns
Best guess is myself and ourselves
Many other languages have such forms so an example would be **mi** chiamo and **ci** conosciamo in Italian
Здравей, казвам се Джон. Приятно ми е да се запознаем! Откъде идваш?
Hello, I say John
Nice me to met
From where you come
I didn't serve in the military but I was apprehended by military security in the baracks next to my grandmother's for sneaking in and picking plums off one of the trees
I was in 6th grade :D
My dad has a lot of those
One guy he went to basic training with was a chess wizard, and he could beat anyone with his back turned
(They'd tell him where they moved a piece, and he'd tell them where to move one right back, etc
Never lost
) But their drill srgt (or commanding officer, not sure which exactly in our case) took the guy's set eventually
Another time he was in Baghdad and somebody was telling a pretty unbelievable family story relating to his grandfather
that sounded familiar
He got into an argument with the guy
Turned out they're cousins that met hundreds of miles away, for the first time in their lives
His stories about scorpions fucking *everywhere* have inspired me to check my shoes for arachnids before I put them on to this day
Most of the soldiers inside were 18-20 year olds in for their mandatory military service - it was still a thing
The
I don't know how it's called in English - the director, laughed his ass off when I was brought up to him by the security soldiers
He said: "I've been spending too much time worrying how to keep these idiots in (the soldiers), that I didn't think someone would come from outside". I was just escorted to the gate and I went home but he did make me leave the plums tho
Dude, the story is actually **so** crazy I'm planning on writing about it in detail some day
So their grandfather had a long lost baby brother - the father gave the baby away when the mother died, and it was just impossible for him to take care of all the kids + a baby that needs nursing
He told the siblings the baby died, too
Fast forward some years, the kid finds out he's adopted and finds his biological family - very happy he has siblings now
Some time after he gets engaged and he's about to be married
and his bride bails on him
Literally, runaway bride, in the wedding dress, a few hours before the service
He's crushed
Maybe 50-ish years later, this guy is old and widowed, at a mineral bath for back pain relief and relaxation
And he runs into the same runaway bride - now old and widowed herself - who left him at the altar decades ago
*And they get married
And this is the story that my dad overhears, calls out the other guy on how impossible that is because that's *his* grandfather, what are the odds of the same thing happening to someone else
And they turn out to be cousins lol
Yeah
That base was converted into a museum few years later when the mandatory service was discontinued
By the way - this is [said gate] It lists the names of those of the 29th Infantry Regiment who died in WWI and the Balkan wars
Yeah
I am not in the tree-climbing phase of my life anymore :D
I see some generalisations and they come close, but the only answer that could be 100% fair to the question is: it is different for every country
In every constitution or other parts of the legislature the power and the responsibilities of those figures are determined
For example Emmanuel Macron in the role of a president is way more powerful than the Bulgarian president
In presidential republics such as the USA, France and Russia the president is one of the most powerful people in the state in terms of powers and he is a representative/head of of the government
In Bulgaria, the president is not attached to it - the president is a separate institution and the head of the government is the prime minister
So, depending on whether it is a presidential or a parliamentary form of state, it is the either the president or the prime minister who is the wielder of the executive power, which he exercises with the ministers
If you want to know what the difference is in terms of powers and responsibilities, you need to look up the constitution or some summary of it and you will get an idea
There are no schoolbook definitions to state the differences since it changes from country to country
Source: have studied international relations and have had classes on division of power, state structure and functions and e.t.c.
Not really
On 9^(th) of May we are preoccupied with arguments pro and con the Victory Parade in Moscow
I have never heard this my entire life, if anything some people do acknowledge that it is EU day, but barely
Idk about the German flag but when I was in Nurnberg I saw many houses flying the FC Nurnberg flag (the football team) and also some flying the Bavarian flag
Found it really strange how some people are such big fans of their club
Basically the country is split by russophiles and russophobes
Russophiles celebrate it as Victory day, some of them go and put flowers on old Soviet-era monuments
Russophobes don't celebrate it at all
I have never seen anybody celebrating it as Europe day
We weren't really a dictatorship until 1934 when Zveno couped the government
Still back then we were chasing our national reunification with Dobruja and Macedonia
Our economy was the strongest in the Balkans (tho heavily tied to Germany)
At first we were neutral but then we had no chance, we had to join the Axis or we would have been invaded
Yeah, kinda
At the end of the war we had more territory
We weren't occupied like the serbs or the greeks
The only downside is that we got bombed by the americans
Our soldiers weren't on the Eastern front
So yeah, it went pretty good compared to the rest of Europe
Mission London (Мисия Лондон) for Bulgaria
Letter to America (2000)
Not really sure, don't know any good Bulgarian movies
Bulgarian has a certain lexical and grammatical richness to it that I can't get enough of, not to mention our colloquialisms and proverbs
Names, by extension, are very versatile - you can have *Ivan*, the default name
If you're yelling at him, he becomes *Ivané*, if you're talking about him, he can become *Vankata* ("the Vanka", Vanka is a common nickname/diminutive for Ivan)
In English (and most other languages I'm familiar with) *John* is always *John*, only sometimes *Johnny*, no matter if I'm talking to him or about him, and the sentence or grammar never requires that to change
In Bulgarian, the need for this change isn't really a need, grammatically, but it's leftover from an earlier stage of the language and it's pretty much mandatory speech - it just sounds better if you do it, than if you don't. (I'm sure this is subjective but you can just tell when something sounds *right*, you know
Our own cultural context is *very* rich
You can translate some words like "voevoda" to "chieftain" but you do lose something along the way of translation
This way I have friends who are funny in English, but they're fucking *hilarious* in Bulgarian
For example: my friend was retelling a conversation with their grandmother, and the punchline was that their grandmother was asking them  something, and the final answer was "I don't throw beans
" That doesn't really make sense, does it
Now if I give you the context that throwing beans is a method of fortune telling/reading the future, it *still* doesn't sound too funny
The particular way the words were put together goes a long way, too
We mostly don't use the "I" part of "I'm". For example, if someone were to ask me "What are you doing", they'd mostly phrase it as (literal translation) "What are doing", but with a different form of "doing" so that I know it's related to me
Правя - I am doing
Правиш - you are doing
Прави - he/she/it is doing
Правим - we are doing
Правите - you (plural) are doing
Правят - they (plural) are doing
It has some odd things that just don't make sence in other languages
For example: Искаш ли да ядеш шамари?
Which is translated "Do you want to eat slaps"
The meaning is something like:"If you don't do -insert something here- I'm going to slap you"
There are lots of other things that make 0 sence in english, but you will probably get bored if I write them
Also, it can sound hard and soft at the same time and I find it cool
English is soo good for music and has the highest information density
The information per syllable is extremely high making the language very efficient at expressing ideas
None
Bulgarian cuisine is a collection of only exquisite top notch meals
Examples being кебапчета with лютеница and шкембе чорба among many others
"Shkembe chorba" is tripe soup - local classic
Was told by a foreign ex that they only use tripe to feed it to their dog there
Also, a beverage called "boza". Foreigners hate it, we drink it since childhood here and it's pretty well-liked
It's made from fermented grains and some sugar
Dude, that sounds delicious
You can't say that when the full English breakfast exists mate
English food is actually pretty good, even if a bit simple at times
Tripe soup is magical but the smell is what *really* cures the hangover
Окей has been integrated in Bulgarian vernacular for decades
As in other cases, the adjective means "good" rather than "meh".
Pretty common, even though we have a couple of substitutes
I would say, we're still free so just take it from me that everything is A-ok, don't check for yourself and please go back to your timeline now
Did Macedonia even exist in 1919
Malta, Hungary and Lithuania
Hungary is such a fascinating nation to me
Lots of interesting history, the language omg is just brilliant and the origins of the Hungarians
All of these topics are very interesting and I feel like it's an overlooked nation
Also I know it sounds bias but Bulgaria too
This probably a bit of illogical and unpopular opinion, but I approach this from another angle
Yes, it is sad that a building with so much history, having endured a lot and inspired so many people is burning down, but think about it
If another big church or mosque or some other cultural/religious building, that has not been so popular from literature or from being promoted as a cultural spot burns down, there probably won't be such a big outcry, if it was let's say in Africa
Thus, I'd say, if it wasn't popular then it wouldn't have been maintained that much or at all if it was at some godforsaken place where the society is poor or doesn't give a damn about culture
So we should have been happy that we got to experience/know/see it despite it being 8 centuries old, because nothing is made to last forever
The sad thing is that this building got to lose most of its original self so abruptly
yes this is very sad moment in europe and world cultural history
I have been to the one in Reims and it is a great place I recommend it as well
This is the church where a big chunk of France's kings were crowned throughout its history
We kind of stare, I've had foreign friends point it out as a bit weird
It's not even necessarily with any negative connotations or snooping, I guess we just kind of do it more often or more visible than other peoples
As a Bulgarian what you describe sounds extremely familiar, lol
Everyone hate Sofia too
This is the first time a government is set to finish its term since 2009, so yeah - we have had three interim governments appointed by the President since I started voting
It's pretty much expected for anyone under 30 to speak some level of English, and anybody over 50 to speak at least *some* Russian
We have a very high emigration rate, so the majority of young people are fluent in English *and* one more foreign language - most commonly German
This isn't reflective of the whole country but at least in my part of it, and in my social circles, it's a prevaling theme
I'm actually very surprised when somebody I meet (around my age) doesn't know any English, and I've had friends express similar disbelief when people they work or study with are unfamiliar with it
Most people speak 2 languages
Its seen as normal
Younger people speak English and older people speak Russian
It is a must here in Bulgaria
Every student studies at least one foreign language and I would say a huge portion of the median students have some knowledge in another
Most of our parents and grand parents have had to study Russian at school and some speak either German (because of East Germany) or French (France has always endorsed smart people and culture and some people during socialist times could use this to migrate there)
Nowadays English, German, French and Spanish are the most popular second and third language
I would say that Italian also holds popular along with Russian for some parts of the students
People here are really keen on learning foreign languages due to opportunities for work, but I'd like to think it is also because of genuine interest
It is uncommon, but not exactly rare to find people who have studied Polish, Czech or Hungarian as well as Scandinavian languages
I personally have studied English since I was 6, Russian for 3 years in school and German in highschool
In my second year in university I started learning Swedish and want to learn it up to at least B2, hopefully C1 level
Edit: some grammar and wording
That is exactly the reason why so few people are fluent or at least conversational in English
Their language's vocabulary and grammar are both very different from any Indo-European language so practically any foreign language will be hard to learn
Compare that to the Scandinavian languages, which are extremely close to English and it's really not a surprise why Hungarians are having a harder time with the language
Oh yes definitely
Just the sheer fact that their languages has 18 CASES is enough to drive crazy any foreigner, foolish enough to try and learn the language
I havent heard of such a rule, altough in some houses not taking your shoes off is disrespectful
Depending on the context
I'd expect my closest friends to act as if they are at their own homes, so if they open the fridge when we are at my place to eat or have drinks - no
But gursts who aren't really my closest friends won't even consider going anywhere near my fridge, nor I - theirs
Literally all our neighbours have fantastic nature, delicious traditional cuisine, and are very hearty people
Turkish people are very helpful, in my experience
Macedonians sound a funny to us and they're very boisterous
Serbians have amazing barbecue and alcohol
Romania has pretty good post-communist infrastructure
Greece is
there
I've never been but it's where everybody I know goes to the beach, because it's better than ours
They're cool, too
**Turkey** - I love how polite they are
Turkish people, at least from the regions I have been in, are very cordial and nice
It's definitely a deep cultural thing, as I do know that the literary Turkish language has "politeness" gramatically ingrained in it, and people seem to really adhere to that
**Romania** - They seem to be a lot more outgoing than us, with cultural events, parties etc
**Serbia** - Food's delicious
Sausages, cevapi and burek are all superior to our versions there
**Macedonia** - I love how in touch they are with the ancient Hellenic roots of the South Slavs
It is truly amazing how despite having basically a complete cultural overlap with Bulgaria, Macedonia has somehow preserved an ancient connection to Alexander the Great, which was nonexistent for hundreds of years, and suddenly resurrected in the last few decades
Amazing
**Greece** - I love the culture of family and unity
Greeks seem a lot better than us at knowing their extended family, keeping in touch and an overall strong sense of community
I have endless admiration for this and wish we were closer to this
Putin, of course
Without him, I could probably return to Russia and not be afraid for my kids anymore (queer family)
Ivan Geshev
He's our chief prosecutor and reports to no one while all other prosecutors report to him so he has unlimited power over who gets prosecuted
He is a complete failure but got the position because of how broken the system is
I meant that me (woman) is married to another woman but we both  are bi so I don't like to call us lesbian couple
Well now I live in country that isn't pro-LGBT either, but just "nobody is actively trying to take you kids away" is already couple of light years better than what we had in Russia
It wasn't always the case and it change quite fast
12 years ago, lots of Moscow fertility clinics websites had pages for their lesbian clients
Then, anti-gay propaganda law passed and everything changed
I'm pretty sure that without intensive goverment propaganda feeding it everything will come back to neuturality
Plus, gen z in Russia isn't that different from european/american gen z and straight millenials are also changing for better
For example, when government made [this  hilariously bad anti-gay video] couple of weeks ago  most comments were very supportive and disguisted by people who made this video
Different standarts I guess
I'm also millenial but I can live rude words from some people (though surprisingly I never heard any IRL in any country), it's systemic oppresion by government that makes things unbearable
There is a clerk at the baby registry who is the ultimate decider
The parents can appeal to the court, but the basic rules are:
* the name must be a real human name from any culture - it can be a Bulgarian traditional name, Slavic, British, German, Muslim etc
* the name must not be offensive to the child - it can’t be Asshole Petrov or something like that
* the name must not be offensive to the Bulgarian nation or state - it can’t be Bulgarochtonos etc
* the name can’t be spelled in weird ways - it can’t contain numbers, weird letter clusters etc
* the name can be transliterated into Latin (for international documents) only under the rules of the Transliteration Act - the name Миролюба can only be spelled Mirolyuba in Latin
* if the parents can’t or won’t agree on a name by the third day after the birth, the clerk will choose the baby’s name for them and their choice can’t be appealed
It's very appreciated if a foreigner have learned something,  we love when someone have put a bit of effort to learn our very unpopular language
You can almost always hear the difference when a foreigner is speaking Bulgarian for just a few days, so when somebody says to me "Hello, good morning" or whatever in Bulgarian I always say "nice
" in English and from there we either continue speaking English or hand language if they don't know it
I usually don't have a problem if they insist on speaking Bulgarian but sometimes foreigners pronounce words in such a funny way that there's always a smile on my face
I'd definitely say roses
We are pretty proud with our rose industry here in Bulgaria
Roses, cigarettes, rakia, kebapcheta/kufteta
In that order
Roses with a hint of дюнерче.
My home town decreased with about 20 000 people in the past 15-20 years
Once people finish high school they move to Sofia and the other 2-3 big cities in Bulgaria or abroad for university/ work
It’s not that noticeable because the town is still rather big (for BG standards at least) but I don’t wanna imagine what the situation feels like in smaller towns (<50k or less)
Well, Bulgaria has the fastest shrinking population on Earth
Currently, nobody is doing anything about this, except maybe giving people from North Macedonia and Bessarabia citizenship because their great-grandparents and grandparents were Bulgarians, but those people immediately move to Western Europe, because they can't as Macedonians or Ukrainians
There have been some policies aimed at bringing Bulgarian diaspora back in the country, but with little success
Bulgarians will start coming back maybe in 15-20 years when the country is more advanced and the wages are similar to Central Europe now
But I fear nothing less than some government law like "have at least two children by 40 years old", basically the opposite of the Chinese one child policy, is going to fix this
By the way, I kinda have a prediction that in about a decade or two, poorer people from Western Europe will start to move en masse to Eastern Europe, because the wages here will be closer to those in Western Europe, but the prices of real estate, for example, will be a lot lower, especially because of the mass exodus (demand is low, therefore prices are also low)
English will be a lot more prevalent, so the language barrier will also shrink
This has already started for older people
For example, there's a good number of Germans in Bulgaria who are over 65 and live here comfortably with their pensions, while they would struggle in Germany
This is going to become a trend in the coming years
My whole country's population is decreasing rappidly
Literally whole towns get abandoned and deleted off the map, which leaves tons of abandoned houses and facilities
Its very scary but most people dont care, which i find very dumb
I hope economic growth brings people back to the country
I'm from the biggest city, so my experience with it isn't as 'severe'.
People from all over the country move here for university and work, or they go abroad
Sometimes both - as a result, I have friends and family all over the world
There's plenty of near empty or abandoned villages, and smaller cities/towns keep getting emptier
We do get people, in small numbers, who move here from abroad
Retired elderly, English, American or otherwise, who just want a calm lifestyle
Also students from other countries because our universities are cheaper
It's mostly sad but also, life goes on
I'd love for it to be vibrant and the population evenly distributed but we don't have much going on around the villages and that's that
One of the cities I lived in
Decreased for 20 years with around 20k to 30k people
Bulgaria has the fastest shrinking population:
From almost 9 000 000 in 1989 to <7 000 000 today
There are hundreds of abandoned villages
The fall of communism and the following years of BS surely contributed to it but I think we were gonna drop in population regardless
See, during the ‘30s, ‘40s, ‘50s etc Bulgaria drastically went from a super rural country to a very urbanised one
People massively moved from the villages to the cities
So what does this mean
Well, when people used to live in the villages they had farms and big houses therefore it was also normal for each family to have 5-6 children sometimes more
Once everyone moved to the cities people’s lifestyle changed and they now had 1-2 children max
I’m not saying emigration after ‘89 is not an important factor but there’s more to the population decline for sure
Forgot to mention: during the first half of 20
Century, Bulgaria also received a major population boost by Bulgarian refugees coming from every single neighbouring country
It’s tough
Part of me has considered moving back
For a host of reasons
I’m currently working and going on to train I a high demand field worldwide
I also am fairly burnt from the West
Also the increasing costs of living despite working a good job with a good salary is becoming absurd
Though I’d be burnt out from Bulgaria in different ways
Yes absolutely
If alcohol cigarettes and caffeine are legal, so should weed
Take the market away from the criminals who are currently selling it and put that tax money in the EU coffers for public use
Legalized but regulated
It's currently criminalised here which leads to teenagers and young people having their lives destroyed by like a gram, because police are more concerned with a 17 year old trying to unwind than actual harmful things going on
Furthermore, we are one of the countries with the highest amounts of cigarette consumption in the entire world
Children as early as 12 years old are smokers, and this is not being regulated at all, or even addressed
The fear-mongering around 'drugs' completely ignores how normalized alcoholism and smoking, two extremely accessable bad habits, are
Marijuana has actual medical properties, and incorporating it at least for medicinal usage would only benefit us
It's not a universally good thing, it can be bad for some people, but it is without a doubt a million times better and more beneficial than the 'drugs' we are consuming constantly anyway
Absolutely
Marijuana has medicial properties as well, and cigarettes are far worse, yet they are perfectly legal and widespread, despite their proven correlation to cancer
And marijuana addiction is closer to an internet addiction than a hard drug addiction, in terms of severity
It's entirely possible to develop one but it depends more on the person because the substance isn't inherently addictive
When I was a kid and had never been abroad I imagined EVERY foreign country looked like Manhattan or downtown LA because my only exposure to the outside world was TV
TBH you can easily lump the balkan, world, spanish and russian civil wars into one big 50 year-long conflict, and future history lessons will almost certainly do so
Why 05 and not 00005
A man of culture
Finally
I once had diner with my friend at 3:30pm
I was staying with him
This was a totally normal thing
I felt as if I'd accidentally agreed to go on a 16 hour fast
In the village where our villa used to be, there is this place called *Chumavi mogili* (Plague's mounds), where during the Plague people would take their family members that were sick with the Plague and leave them there
At the base of the hill where the place is, there is this *cheshma* (water fountain, looking like something like [this] where no healthy person would drink from, but they would go there at sunset to leave baskets with food for their sick loved ones for the next day
When we were little we used to go there on the cheshma and we would tell stories about ghosts and we were sure there were *chumavi* (sick with the Plague) ghosts, that still came to this place at sunset to look for their loved ones
Other creepy place is the village Shishentsi, where people don't dare to go out after dark, because they often hear incorporeal screams and drums, which some old people claim are *talasamsko horishte* (a demon's ball)
A friend from the region once said that the village is cursed for not having any living [kukeri] in it to chase the demons away
God's eyes cave or [Prohodna cave] is spooky as well, especially during full moon
Also:
* the [vampire grave] in Sozopol - a grave of a 35 years old man, who was buried with a metal rod pinning him to the ground through the heart;
* the [Devil's bridge] in Ardino - according to legends, no one could build a bridge over the rushing river but a young builder accepted thr task
One day the Devil himself appeared and told the builder than the only way for a bridge to stand over this spot is to build the Devil's face in the bridge, but the face must be visible and invisible at the same time
So the builder made the bridge to shape the face of the Devil only during [high sun]
* the [darvobrad tree] (named after the ents from LOTR)
This tree is shaped like a man;
* [Sveta Nedelya Church] in Batak - the place where hundreds of Bulgarians were slaughtered by the Ottoman army in 1876's Bataka massacre
The church today displays some of the remains of the now canonised as saint-marters inhabitants of Batak;
* [The Devil on the Zhivkovtsi's Church] \- in the 1970s the Communist party evicted the people of the village of Zhivkovtsi because it was due to be submerged by the new Osogovo dam
For decades the village was under water but recently the water receded and the only piece of art in the Church that survived was an image of the Devil
I see his face in the stone under the bridge - I think that's his face
Some think the arches of the bridge are the hornes and the eyes and the yelow rocks the the nose (or beak)
Yeah
I just remembered another one
This American girl made a video for it:
There are many stories of samodivas attacking people in the 70s and the 80s. The video distorts the legend a little - the men taken by the samodivas are not tortured to death, but they forget to eat or sleep so they die of exhaustion
A newer esoteric urban legend is the one for the [Tsarichina dupka] (The hole in Tsarichina)
In the early 90s the Army started excavations in the centre of Tsarichina village and the official reason was that they thought there is a burried treasure left by Tsar Samuil
According to some UFO-chasers, they were digging to find some mystical or alien artefact
They even took [baba Vanga] to the hole so she can examine it, and after she did, she warned them that there is something very old and very dangerous in there and she begged them not to open it
They didn't listen and continued еxcavations
Some claim they found an alien powersource, explaining the beams of light, that at some point came out of the hole, some claim they found the tomb of the egyptian godess Bast
After two years of secret digging, the army suddenly canceled the project and poured tonnes of concrete in the hole to seal it and the plot of land where the hole is, is now government property
Yes
That's how I see it
No - the stone is part of the bedrock
Some other legends claim he placed his wife's soul in the foundation of the bridge as sacrifice to the Devil, so the beridge can stand
С - with
But it's pronounced sus
Я - pronounced ja
It can mean her in bulgarian
We are the only slavs in the world that don't use я for "I" or "me"
И - and, pronounced as E
А - whereas
У - around, like u nego (у него) means he has it but it literally means around him
А, е, и, в and у are all words in Bulgarian
Most of then don't have a primary role, but actually help bind sentences, add stuff when stating things or show the position of someone/something
Edit: forgot one word/letter
same
Forgot в - means "in" and is pronounced vuv
I don’t think it’s rude - talking about income allows people to measure one another
At my job when appraisals come round all we talk about is the salaries we (want to) get
Not talking about it can only help an employer to hire people on different wages for same or similar positions
I don't mind sharing if there is a valid reason - for example someone is looking for a similar job to mine and asks me what he should negotiate for
I would never bring it up if not asked
I have had quite a few people ask me how much I make out of the blue and my answer depends on how close they are
Overall, I don't think it's taboo but I wouldn't share my income to people who didn't ask, and might refuse to answer to people who asked if I decide it might create problems or tension
I am in IT: we don’t have a union
Interesting, and do the people, whose salaries you ask about in the tax office, get notified about it
Are black or green olives more popular in your country
In Bulgaria black olives are a standard
Way more popular compared to green olives
People usually associate green olives with Greece
Which ones are more popular in your countries and are consider more 'standard' compared to the other ones
Nahh, I prefer black ones
Greens have a very strong taste, I can eat just one green olive a year, like a shot
Black ones I can eat them as a snack, very mild and pleasant taste
They wut
They color green olives to make them look black
Wtf, the taste will still be the same
What a scam lol
You have fish stuffed olives there ??
These look like pointy nipples
I feel weird about them, I'll pass
I've never heard something like that, interesting
Also the texture will be the same
In Bulgaria the black ones are very cheap, so there is no need to do all these shenanigans
Probably because it is super easy and common to import them, since Greece is right next to our butt
Interesting
I have never even imagined fish stuffed olives
Now I must find and try some
I was always curious, are the Swedish speakers in Finland regular Finns who just happen to speak Swedish as a native language due to history (Finland being part of Sweden for a very long time, similarly to most Irish people speaking English nowadays) or actual Swedish people whose ancestors moved to Finland and they managed to preserve their language
Ukraine was never really a bilingual country, at least in the sense that is meant in this thread
In fact, for the size of its minority language speakers it had easily the worst language laws in Europe
So I don't see on what exactly you're basing your claims
The experience of people living in actual bilingual countries is completely at odds with your opinion
> Russian is vastly more dominant and preferred,
There is also the factor that this was the situation before he came to power and would be under any regime that actually took the opinion of the people into account
After all, in most normal countries the dominant and preferred language language is the majority language
When I was a kid literally everyone used to walk to and back from school, usually in small groups of 4-5 kids who all lived in the same neighbourhood or area of the city
Kids who lived outside the city always took the bus together
Parents would only come to pick you up on rare instances like if there was a huge storm outside or something
I don’t really know if it’s still like this though
Yeah
I was going to school alone ever since 2nd grade
I have heard a lot of people to pronounce (3) three as free, so in the shop for example you here free ot this, free of that ets
In Bulgarian, "Fitness" is used to refer to a gym or a fitness centre
So it's not uncommon for people to say "I go to the fitness"
Lol in the early stages Bulgarians mess up the other way around and will call a chair "he" or a table "she" and so on
I'm completely fluent in English and have no accent anymore but words like jeweler and jewelry *still* give me a hard time
I have to actually think about how to say them every time and I have to push my brain to do it lol
You should try saying "the rural juror". That one is a trip even for native speakers
Some Bulgarians sound like babies too but for a different reason - they pronounce a lot of Ls as W. They can say the L sound in Listen but not in "flowing". So they literally say things like "hewwo" and "fwowing" and "wike" (like)
Another section of Bulgarians can't pronounce w at ALL, so it gets replaced with u. So it's uindou (window), uash (wash), uear (wear), etc
Yes I've noticed that, however because English is my second language and I learned it primarily by reading than listening, unlike native speakers, I associate it strongly with the spelling of the word, so I have to consciously think about how to pronounce it
Our [ID cards] are pretty regular - they are as big as credit cards and they have a picture, our names, permanent residence address, our Personal identification number, height, eye colour and some biometric data that allows us to travel with our ID within the EEA without a passport
Well i learned basic phrases from school
But 80% of my English is from Games and Youtube videos
Well, I started understanding basic English at around 7, 8 and then developed my knowledge through television and games and youtube videos
This helped me a lot and my uncle is from Manchester and he said that I talk better than most Bulgarians
I'm really grateful for that and I hope I continue learn new languages (I actually know some Russian, this time i learned it through school)
Learned it at 8 and was fluent by 9 , Im Bulgarian so English is very basic in comparison so it was fairly easy
Just read alot thats my tip
I can recognise if somebody is from the Balkans but the different Balkan nationalities are more like generalisations (eg tall person - likely Serb/Montenegrin/Bosniak, slightly darker - somewhere from the south Balkans), but those are not always correct
It's impossible if they're European
Distinct characteristics are often shared in regions and not countries, so you'd have to choose
I can guess most accents in Europe tho
Yes and no
I can guess where they are generally from based on area - those being the UK, Western Europe, Northern Europe, Eastern Europe and the Balkan area
Guessing someone's nationality is more generalisation outside of that
It's honestly mostly the eyes that make it easier to guess, as well as the face shape
Russians have very specific facial features in my opinion, I'm confident I can recognize one in a local crowd
And no, it's not the tracksuits lol
[yes I'm aware not everyone is Caucasian in russia]
Germans always wear sandals with white socks and carry a camera
In other words, painfully unfashionable
The English are usually piss drunk at a bar or eating a kebab right across the street
Turkish tourists have a cigarette in their mouth at all times
I can also spot a Scandinavian pretty easily, especially if it's a tall woman
But what brand of Scandinavian
Who knows
For the most part I can recognize ethnic groups, nationalities is quite different
Ive noticed Bosniaks kinda draw their words out while Serbs just sound like Russians/Ukranians/Bulgarians
No idea how that difference in accents happens
fly + elephant in Bulgaria :)
Hmm, never heard that one actually
I'm probably too young (or from a different region
I'm from central-west)
Never heard it either (Sofia region)
My choice would be „уйде коньо у реката“ translating to "horse went in the river", and meaning "oopsie, shit's fucked".
Why do our idioms abuse animals so much lmao
Whaaat
I thought that Belgium, Swiss and Luxembourg spoke only belgish , swissish and luxembourgish
I don't know if Bulgaria is "reknowned" for our beaches across the rest of Europe but we're cheaper than most of the Mediterranean, as far as Western tourists are concerned
Most popular beach is probably Sunny Beach - it is also the trashiest
Bulgaria has nice beaches
The Netherlands doesn't, but they have huge docks that allow for efficient trade
Waar
Terschelling
Misschien genoeg voor een Nederlander maar valt in het niets vergeleken met het strand in Bulgarije
There is a favourite alternative rock band of mine from Bulgaria which is called Hayes & Y. They sing in English so that would make them accessible
Also, there is this great formation called Oratnitza which uses uncommon musical instruments and make music with motives from national folklore songs and a more "modern" sound
It's an interesting fusion so I recommend that you at least hear them even if it is not your cup of tea
Sofia and literally every other part of Bulgaria
Reasons:
- Sofia is the only place in the country with significant population growth (there are 3-4 cities where the population remains stable, everywhere else is in a nasty demographic crisis)
- Sofians are significantly richer than the average Bulgarian
- Almost all economic and cultural activities take place in Sofia (a bit of it also goes to the aforementioned 3-4 cities)
- Sofians are on average much more liberal than the average Bulgarian
This is why:
- According to Sofians, the rest of the country is either a Sofian suburb or backwards underdeveloped unpopulated countryside
- According to the rest of the country, Sofians are privileged snobs who are ready to sacrifice their health (air quality in Sofia is deplorable most of the year) in order to make more money
- According to Sofians, the rest of the country is backwards
In Bulgaria, it’s probably Plovdiv and Varna, the 2nd and 3rd biggest cities
Always arguing about which city is the second biggest (Plovdiv always seems to win by a couple of thousand)
Varna is the so-called sea capital, Plovdiv gets a lot of new investments ever since the highway in the South was built (the highway Sofia-Varna has been in construction for 46 years; yep, you read that correctly)
It’s mostly a nice and humorous rivalry, tho
As someone from Varna, even I can’t not chuckle at T-shirts that say “Make pLOVEdiv, not WARna”.
There’s also a general Sofia vs
the rest of the country
People from “the province” (as people in Sofia call them, you can imagine that term is really not popular with non-Sofians) see Sofia equal parts as the shiny castle on the hill, but also the evil stepmom that gets the bulk of the money in the country and pretends anything outside of the Sofia Ring Road doesn’t exist
The truth is somewhere in the middle, imo
Drop a few nukes on Paris and see the whole France disintegrate
I am not Cypriot but I live in Cyprus, the reunification is important to the Greek Cypriots such as my friends
The frying of cut potatoes was invented by the Irish
You may have perfected it but you did not invent it
>Only **Yeltsin** and Medvedev were 100% Russian
There were rumors that he was Estonian
We have separate years
Like, say, 5-8 grade we'd learn only about Bulgarian history and relations with our neighbors (eg
wars with Byzantium, Latins etc) and then 9-11 grades would be for European/World history and finally 12 is like a big overview of Bulgarian and 19/20th century world history (we do learn 19/20 century history before that so 12th grade is mostly as I said overview for the matura test at the end of the year)
Every Bulgarian and Greek has experienced a "difference in perspectives in the historic events" with North Macedonia
> It's the North Macedonians who have am entirely different story
That was what I was talking about
What I meant was that due to the heavy government propaganda, North Macedonia for decades claimed parts of the history, culture and legacy of Greeks and Bulgarians
It's been better for the past few years, but if you go to a North Macedonian news website and see the comments (which I can easily understand, as the languages are nearly identical), it's... harsh
Really harsh
Like, I get that people wouldn't trust sources and governments and people that have clear interest in the matter
I get they don't trust what Greeks and Bulgarians are saying
What I don't get is why they distrust what **everybody else** is saying, because it's the same thing
In North Macedonia, especially on the far right, there are these ideas that Bulgaria and Greece have somehow managed to convince Germany, the UK, Italy, France, Spain, Russia, the US and basically the whole world to teach "our" version of history and it's some massive anti-Macedonian conspiracy
I don't get that at all
One can fall in a rabbit hole of absurdity if they checked the North Macedonian Wikipedia - half of Bulgarian, Greek and even some Serbian national heroes are claimed as Macedonian
Meanwhile, 100 000 North Macedonians have received Bulgarian citizenship in the past 15 years
It's hilarious on a table with friends while drinking
It's not hilarious when it becomes government policy
Imagine if Canada just started claiming that Lincoln was Canadian and explaining that him being an American is a big conspiracy
Oh, this, absolutely this
Especially Americans love to tell us what is Socialism and what is Communism while having absolutely no idea whatsoever
Yes
I have a bunch of clothes i wear only when i'm home (and maybe to the grocery store)
You can't really chill/eat/cook with the same clothes you go for coffee with friends
Of course, everybody I know does
I walk my dog with them on sometimes
we have it in Russia too
I asked my wife and in her school it was exactly like you wrote
Version from my school made no sence but was less offensive and rhymed
"Mom is cat, dad is Baba Yaga(???), and I wasn't born the best one, I was deformed"/ "Mama koshka papa yozhka a ya ne urodilsya krivenkim rodilsya".
I have had quite some time spent on EU4
Unless I am trying a specific achievement I usually end up playing with Sweden, one of the Germanic princes (if in the north I go for Prussia of course), Japan or Ethiopia
I have had quite a lot of game starts with Ethiopia and I love the Coptic religion mechanism, their interesting starting position and the ability for expansion/colonisation
Occasionally, I like a Burgundian or a Dutch start and be stinking rich and conquer the British isles
After a certain patch I find it pretty exciting to start as some North American tribe and try to fight back those filthy colonisers
Prague or Istanbul
Prague , because I want to experience this amazing culture and just to walk these old streets
Istanbul - I miss Istanbul - the people, the little streets, the feeling to be lost in the crowd, the food
London
My aunt lives there and I really want to visit her and her family
I had planned a trip to Valencia for my daughter to see the Oceanographic Museum fir her birthday
If the season is right this will be the first
Otherwise maybe Prague or Berlin
Zurich
Was on a school trip about a decade ago through Europe, and Zurich was beyond anything a bunch of Bulgarian middle school children have ever seen in luxury retail
We had the whole day to ourselves there, and we had a little game where we split in small groups to roam the city center and whoever finds the most expensive watch first would get  free lunch from the others
Needless to say, it was funny to see those Swiss Rolex shop workers approaching courteously a bunch of kids with ragged backpacks and faces full of wonder
Also, the most expensive watch we found was 1
2 million €, which was surprisingly high for something sitting in a storefront
Bulgarian Parliament
So many rich people, must be easy to get rich when you steal from 7 million people at once
A Burgas suburb filled with Russian businessmen expats
The houses were barely houses, they were closer to mansions
Yeah, it was embarrassingly expensive
Even in the supermarket we could barely afford a candy bar (which came in around 3 Chf - about 8 times more expensive than what you would usually pay for the same brand back home)
>People refusing to talk to you in stores there the moment they realize you're some low class
Oh yeah, I remember that signature look of superiority and subtle sense of contempt when you say "We're just looking around
There is a Chrysler in my neighbourhood with a Virginia license plate
I once met a guy who was travelling from Berlin to Istanbul in the [gymnastic wheel]
Either маймунско "а" [maimunsko a] (monkey "a") or кльомба [klyomba] ("badly written letter")
We call it:
* кльомба (klyomba) - I have no idea what it means but it sounds like something round and blobby
* маймунско а (maymunsko a) - “monkey a”
* маймунка (maymunka) - “small monkey”
Its either маймунско а (maymunsko a) "monkey a" or кльомба (klyomba) wich I don't think can be translated as something other than @ .
Most people call it "маймунско а"(monkey a), I just call it "at", bacouse it is shorter and easier
When shops don't work on a Sunday or that there are far less 24/7 shops
Oh and pharmacies in Greece just decide not to work at some point during the day cause "fuck it there's another pharmacy down the road" but the motherfucker down the road is thinking the same thing so he's also closed
When you get to Rome you get two countries for the price of one
100% Obviously Turkey, like i wouldn't even be surprised with the recent bullshit they've been doing they might just turn their eyes West
Turkey
Again
Russia
Lol as if you wouldn't cheer the Germans on as they leisurely waltz in
Nah, y'all have been doing well in relations with the EU and NATO
Also I think I would be right in saying that no Bulgarians or Romanians would have morale in fighting Serbs
Weeeell
Russia is messing in our stuff, and in other European nations, pretty actively
Buying politicians, even whole parties, and paying for political propaganda and misinformation
This started relatively recently, probably 4-5 years ago
Trolls commenting under our medias and in the social medias
Even creating chaos and because of lies and conspiracies
So yeah, that's one of the reasons why some countries are afraid (or dislike) of Russia
Mind you, I'm talking about the politics and the actions, I have Russian friends and it's not the people's fault
Though, I don't think Russia would ever invade a NATO country
Or that NATO will invade Russia
Russia just creates chaos by different means
Naah, bro, the Turks are already in Viena
Haven't you been recently there :D
btw also was surprised by how often I've heard Bulgarian as well
Two or three times on the streets for one day
When there is a will, there is a way
No, taking advantage of and attacking an unsaported kurdish people, who have been trying to get independence for God knows how long
Sure they're a threat, maybe to your blessed and righteous, almighty leader who doesn't know how to manage internal problems so he creates external ones to distract the uneducated people who worship him like a God
I mean shit, okay, my bad then
I still think Erdogan is a bad leader besides that though, seeing how "well"  Turkey's economy is doing
Considering that one Bulgarian lev is like a billion liri ot doesn't sound good
>Saying that Turkey attacks "Kurdish people" when fighting PKK/YPG is like saying that US attacks Afghans when fighting against Taliban or Muslims when fighting against ISIS
Would be a lot more convincing if you weren't ethnically cleansing Kurds and replacing them with Turkish allies
>PKK has a long history of carrying out terrorist attacks in Turkey and is designated as a terrorist organization by all countries of NATO & EU as well as some others, Turks are not okay with having their Syrian branch on Turkish borders
A potential threat does not give Turkey the right to invade and conquer parts of neighboring countries
>This isn't about Erdogan, I hate him yet still support the operation - opposition parties support it as well, it's a matter of national security for us, not politics
Of course: alll Turks on Reddit hate Erdogan and all support everything he does
None, his way of talking was just a bit more informal, like "ain't". The way everyone talks but no one spells
So for example "all" in his speech would be spelled as "'сичко", instead of "всичко".
We use the word pishtov (gun) for it
There's also the term "tsarski pishtov", literally "the tzar's gun" for when you completely switch the papers with something you've filled in beforehand
Like a ready done essay for example
In Bulgarian it's similar - the word is пищов (pishtov)
It means "pistol".
I googled ethymology of this word in Russian, "shpargalka", and apparently, it comes from Polish word "szpargał".
Not really
Some schools had them but don't use them, but a typical school corridor looks like [this] and a typical class room - like [this]
The schools that I have studied at and am currently studying do, however I personally don't use them as the the breaks between classes aren't very long and there isn't enough time to do anything else but grab your books if you use the locker
That's why I just prepare the things I'll need for the day in the morning and keep them in my backpack
This idea has always been very very weird to me
Why
You just bring a backpack to school, you just have it with you You aren't bringing a suitcase for a sleepover
4 hours in school and you're gone
Another reason we have no lockers is because our schools are most often on "shifts". Considering the school usually can't even accomodate all their students at the same time, it's pretty unlikely they'd be able to provide lockers either
[Hristo Botev] \- one of our national heroes
That's rookie numbers, my backpack was over 6kg when I was 8
Bulgarian
1,000,000 - милион (million)
1,000,000,000 - милиард (milliard)
1,000,000,000,000 - трилион (trillion)
1,000,000,000,000,000 - квадрилион (quadrillion)
Million = милион (milion)
Billion = милярд (miliard)
Trillion = трилион (trillion)
Quadrillion- квадрилион (kvadrilion)
Same shit here
I've heard there's a really big underground system below Sofia, but I've never been or heard more than some murmurs about it
Some photos here and there, but not much
Fast internet and corruption
Ruins and corruption :(
We have lots of caves
And we have a lot of bats like waaaay more species than Romania (suck it up Drakula)
I mean
Aren't we worse off than you guys are
Pretty good bbq as well tbh
Partially thx to Stalin btw
Oh and I forgot
We have the largest percentage of citizens living outside our own country
Okey let's just say we and romania are super corrupt like top tier corrupt
Wait, don't Russia and the Ukraine have the biggest border dispute right now
at least u got lakes
It's an awkward thing to do especially for half of the passengers which are on the back
Fuck any authoritarian party
Italy looks like a boot kicking a ball
That's kind of aesthetic
In school they teach us that Bulgaria looks like a lion (it is the national symbol of the country)
To me personally, it always looked like a puppy
I would say it's hard to tell if any fluent balkan speaker has it as their first language or not
We're taught (forced) to adopt a semi-British accent throughout our education, so only the ones who didn't do well in English class have a very noticeable accent
"Гушкаш букета" Or "Hug the bouquet', cuz u know
When u die you hug some flowers
Our communist leaders allegedly set up companies in western Europe under the nose of the Soviet Union, to do some money laundering as soon as they saw the the communist downfall coming
Shake your head side to side for yes and shake your head up and down for no
I'm surprised how Bulgaria is sometimes called an empire since we've never had an emperor, only tsar/knyaz (khan before that)
Btw at school we've barely mentioned how Bulgarians have taken over other countries but they make sure we don't forget we were under Byzantine rule for 2 centuries and under Ottoman - for 5
The great powers at the time couldn't afford to have a combination of Bulgaria and Romania because it would absolutely dominate the region and throw off what they thought was a balance of power at the time
It would be like a Germany/France in the Balkans, just had to do some developing to catch up with them at the time
No idea
I would take a guess but honestly can't think of anything that even remotely makes sense
In Bulgaria maybe the Trace region is the odd one out
there are more Muslims than Christians which are the majority here
Кърджали. I believe it has the largest Turkish minority of anywhere in the country
I feel bad because Macedonia was my first thought
but would agree on this one, lol
Съсипаха я тая държава
Mostly Turks
I believe the Turkish people there pronounce it more like КърджАли
Chalga or "pop-folk", full stop
Sung by either silicone girls looking like third-rate porn stars or sweaty fat men in white suits orgasmically moaning about money, drinking and women
Made for bellydancing and drunk ululations and snapping fingers while sticking greasy money bills to the dancers' foreheads, all easy things to do for drunk, trashy people
An unholy mix of gypsy music and stolen Serbian turbofolk and, recently, also the worst of silicone MTV soft-porn r'n'b, passed off somehow as a continuation of authentic Bulgarian folk music with which it has nothing in common
It is a song from the early days of our pop folk or as we like to call it chalga
Enjoy
Don't forget this gem, which manages to encompass the filth of chalga while mixing with pseudo-rap and trashy pop:
Jumping on this thread to present this [masterpiece]
my new favourite description of chalga thank you
Turbofolk, chalga and manele are the Balkan trifecta of Trash Music
Slavi is one of the pillars of chalga, always has been
Begone
*holds up a cross*
I was gonna post this one, u beat me to it
I posted some links in the thread, but what's so awesome about divas and fat sweaty guys glorifying money and sex
Mainly our brotherly neighbors in Serbia, Macedonia, and whomever has migrated abroad, I believe
We're all in this together
I lived with my parents until I was 24, during Uni and about 2 years of working
A friend of mine went to Uni abroad for 4 years and then came back and lived with her parents until they were 26
Did not have a problem bringing my partner over, as long as you were quite and respectful, it's all good
In general the culture here is that you don't really need to leave your home unless you really decide to yourself
Parents usually feel okey with having you around
It is nice to help financially or in any other way if possible, but most parents are just happy you are still around
[I love it
We love our anthem

I don't have one, because I don't bake peppers, but many people have one
it’s a special kitchen appliance for cooking/roasting red or bell peppers
They are delicious
They work in salads, sauces and meals
They can be eaten raw, pickled, baked, fried and boiled
Wtf this sentence sounds just so right, the commas are perfect
One simple trick if you don't remember those pesky irregular past tense forms
People names definitely should keep pronunciation
The alternative is lame
From the two options, I would say it's closer to "make sex
" However, ***правя*** can mean ***do***. For example, ***Правя нещо*** commonly means ***I'm doing something*** although it also means ***I'm making something***. So it can be translated as both ***make sex*** and ***do sex***.
Here is not very popular,  but poppy seeds are added on sweet buns, rolls and stuff like that,  sesame seeds are still more popular but poppy is a close second
No one I know or heard about think you can get high with poppy seeds
Yes
We call it "duck language", and we add "па" (pá) to every syllable, in the beginning, I think
It's been a while since I've heard it but here's my attempt
(A duck is „патица“ - „pátitza“)
„Можеш ли да говориш така?“ - Can you speak like this
„Памопажеш пали пада пагопавопариш патапака?“ - Pacan payou paspeak palike pathis
Transcribed to Latin script: „Pamopazhesh pali pada pagopavoparish patapaka
500 year long Ottoman rule which stopped all country development for 5 centuries
Actually agree on how the land would be split between Bulgaria, Greece and Serbia after the first Balkan war
If there was a reasonable compromise, the history of the Balkans in the 20th century would have been much different
The Balkans have the Hajduks/Hajduti
Basically guerilla fighters from that time period (19th century) against Ottoman tyranny (or law, depending on the POV)
Bulgaria had a lot of them - typically simple village folk having enough of Turkish repression and taking up arms
They formed bands (cheta) either in the home land or abroad in Serbia or Romania (I.e. the First Bulgarian Legion)
They often made camp in the mountains and did a lot of raiding, taking coins from governmental convoys or sabotaging Imperial infrastructure
At the time there were also Muslim raider bands (kurdzhalii), which did their raiding against Christian settlements due to the weak Imperial government at the time, so the hajduts also protected the said settlements and fight the Muslim raiders
There were similar movements in Greece and Italy
The Italians didn't have a Myslim overlord though, so their story is a bit different
Haiduti
They were guerilla fighters during Ottoman times
I remember my teacher said that the haiduti fought for revenge while normal revolutionaries fought for change, don't know how true that is but generally, the haiduti are positively viewed here
(although I wouldn't be surprised if they committed war crimes, being a lawless militia and all)
Completely unrelated but we're taught Don Quixote in eighth grade here, thought it's cool
Bulgaria uses that too
If you want something cool to read you should check out Bulgarian and Byzantine relations, there were a lot of wars, peace treaties, and some very brutal battles
It's not
Looks neat
There is a government committee that sets the price of electricity
Also if a manufacturer lists a price as set price, rather than recommended price, you have to sell it at that price or not at all
Newspapers and cigarettes are sold at fixed prices right now
Doesn't matter where you are, the price of your box of smokes is the same in every store, even if everything else costs triple
We used to learn about the Yalta conference as somewhat of a 'bruh' moment
I'm gonna set aside the military agreements as they are well known
I don't know how much of it was fiction but I remember reading about Stalin and Churchill quite literally dividing the Balkan states among the west and the east on a piece of napkin; one would write up the names they wanted and the other would correct, if necessary
After a couple of passes that was that; no words uttered

It's defined as brandy, different distilling method
Im Bulgarian but ive lived in England for my whole life and i think that english can be very easy but its not the easiest since all the grammar rules makes it confusing
It's pretty easy to learn
It's basically everywhere, no gendered words, easier grammar
now Bulgarian (native), English and learning German
When I was little I just watched English cartoons, but boy German is way too complicated
Very easy actually, compared to spanish or german
My partner has been trying to learn Bulgarian
There's so little resources available it's crazy
His favourite word so far is Shisharka (pinecone)
We named our cat that
I've been born here and still struggle as Bulgarian is rich in words and, bruh, our writing grammar, the f is this thing
We call Beijing Pekin, Munich is Myunhen and Edinburgh is Edinburg
We also pronounce Washington with a hard V - Vashington and we still use Bulgarian names for most cities in Northern Greece and European Turkey, most notably Thessaloniki is Solun and Edirne is Odrin
In Bulgarian, it's almost only nearby places in the Balkans that can have a very different name than the one established in English
* Thessaloniki is **Solun**
* Adrianople/Edirne is **Odrin**
* Constantinople/Istanbul was historically **Tsarigrad**
English - Bulgarian
Beijing - Pekin
Pyongyang - Pkhenyan
Thessaloniki - Solun
We call it Viena
Ha, it's Dunav (Дунав) for us in Bulgaria
Yes, we have [bgmaps] картата в BG Maps:"
[bgmaps
com] has accurate address numbers where Google Maps often has them really far off
Some times in reverse order
For example in [Shumen] there is a main street whose numbers start at the end of the city and grow larger towards the centre, which is opposite of the standard numbering scheme
For some time the numbers on some maps wrongly assumed normal numbering
Yes and no
I use Moovit, which is an app, that helps u when catching your bus or subway and tells you when and how to catch it
You can set a desired arrival time which is very handy
It has a great map of the main cities in Bulgaria and their public transport
I love it
As a new student in my city this was very helpful
Also it's very helpful for foreigners to get to all of Sofia's museums and sites
For hiking in Bulgaria, [BG Mountains] is king
1 lev - 1 bread or 1 packet ? (plastic jar
) yogurt
10 leva - 1kg
pork chops
100 lv
- 2 weeks worth of food for a single person like me .
Bulgaria, Sofia, very roughly, as order of magnitude
1 lev - crap Lavazza capsule coffee from a street kiosk, 10 leva - lunch main course in the city center, 100 leva - two monthly public transport passes or three months of gigabit internet
Edit: 2 leva \~ 1 euro
First we learn cursive
after 4th grade we can write the way we want
In Bulgaria we must write in cursive in school
Last time I ate one was a fire roasted octopus in a tavern in Nea Platia south of Thessaloniki
I like it, but I don't try to cook it myself
It sounds normal to me, I've eaten octopuses , calamari etc
and find them delicious
The entire northeastern region (Vidin, Vratsa, Montana etc
) is the perfect meme target - it's the poorest and most backwater region in the country, plus they have a funny accent/dialect
They usually get portrayed as basic drunks, really poor and who exclusively listen to Serbian pop-folk (a Balkan type of music)
The other one is Pernik, a town near the capital
The running joke is that they only drive VW Golf, made to be as loud as possible, and enjoy beating each other up on a daily basis
Despite all the comments in this thread, there are many more Europeans who move to the US than vice versa
I find Europeans to be very prejudiced against the US, thinking they're better, more cultured, more friendly, etc
A lot of them have never spent any real time there beside being tourists
The American society doesn't reflect my values and the job opportunities I have in other countries, are far superior than those in the US
As a physician, I would be constantly endangered by lawsuits
Besides, I would be very far away from my family
As a European who has lived in America for about 15 years now and want to move back to Europe soon, it really reaffirms my decision to move back to Europe since I hear everyone talking about how much they hate America
I have never ever witnessed such conversation, but I doubt people would be against it
I imagine it is not something that comes up in a day to day conversations, but it will be completely understandable from an expecting mother to inquire about it
The "official English name"? Mate, what
The names of the countries in English aren't the "official" ones
If there is an official name of a country, that is the name in their native language and all others are translations or variations of it, including in English
And to answer your question - all of them
Obviously
There is a difference in literally all names, even if it's just a pronunciation difference
Croatia - we call it Hărvatia (Хърватия)
Montenegro - we call it Černa Gora (Черна Гора)
China  - we call it Kitai (Китай)
Can't think of any other ones
99,9% of our country names are identical to the english ones, for example Anglia, Finlandia, Franzia, Ispania, Norvegia, Ukraina, Moldova, Rusiya, Turtsiya, Sărbia, etc
Funny thing about Bulgaria is that our name is so consistent throughout history that there are no other names for Bulgaria from other countries
Croatia-Хърватска(Hurvatska)
Sweden-Швеция(Shvecia)
Switzerland-Швейцария(Shveicaria)
Montenegro-Черна Гора(Cherna Gora,directly translated-Black Forest)
Your edit doesn't correct your biggest mistake - that the English name is somehow the official one
It is not
The official name isn't Germany, it should be Deutschland if anything
That's the point, IT IS NOT THE OFFICIAL NAME
There are many
I suppose "Аз съм българче" (I am Bulgarian) is the most appropriate for the topic
We have to learn it by heart in elementary school and if you don't know all its words your patriotic grandfather can become very disappointed
Because you sold it at a profit
That's the smart thing to do hehe
Свещената римска империя. The literal translation of Holy Roman Empire
Yes
Bulgarian at one point had ~50% Ottoman Turkish vocabulary, (can't remember when it started chanign, maybe late 1800s or early 1900s? Too lazy to look it up right now) so there has been a gradual replacement of those terms with Slavic origin words
Every newer generation uses less and less of them
There is a significant difference between the number of them in my own vocabulary vs
that of my parents, vs that of my grandparents, great-grandparents, etc
Ottoman Turkish vocabulary was, as others have said, itself comprised of a lot of Persian and Arabic loanwords among Turkic ones
You can still hear a lot of them in Bulgarian folk songs
But generally now, if there is a common Slavic alternative, many are regarded as more informal and sometimes crude
Sort of
Here people only talk about words that have a Bulgarian equivalent but we end up using the loan word more often than not
We actually have two different words depending on the origin of the loanword - чуждици [chuz'ditzi]° which is used for words that existed in Bulgarian, essentially replacing a Bulgarian word and заемки [zaemki], which is used for words that did exist in Bulgarian
No one would complain about the word *skateboard* [скейтборд] but some people would complain about the usage of the word алтернатива [alternativa] because we already have the word възможност [vuzmoz'nost]°. Some people claim that modern words are being replaced by English words (say the word for friend, user, fashion
) but I personally rarely see that happen
Anecdotal evidence, technically, so don't take my word for granted, it could just be the people I know
Funnily enough, a Bulgarian writer from the 19th century named Ivan Bogorov wrote about purism
He tried to push towards the use of Bulgarian words
And ended up being memed instead
The most popular one would be him replacing the word for match°° with the word 'strike-burn-stick' (драсни-пални-клечица [drasni-palni-kletchitza])
What's even funnier is that it actually passed - there are some old match boxes that were used by soldiers with the words 'Български пали-дръвца' [bulgarski pali-druvtza] or *Bulgarian burn-stick'°°°.
° No idea how to write ж with latin letters
Think of it as the second g in garage
Or as how someone French would pronounce that second g.
°° Кибрит in Bulgarian, coming from the Turkish word for match
°°° Technically, дръвца means 'small tree' but it can also be used to mean something wooden from a tree as well, like a stick
> mokrostupy
That is hilarious lmao
Can you give some examples
I find this interesting
I know right, it literally made me laugh out loud
Some of those have analogues or kind of analogues in Bulgarian so I get what you mean, it would be really weird to use words like that when talking about those things, lol
It's just not the same
Aha, I see what you mean now
It makes sense to me as a Bulgarian speaker because we also have djezve, and it's the specific thing you're talking about while something like "kavnik" would just be a general coffee making thing (if it was a word)
I agree that English is much more influential in not just Slovenia but many other countries as well
The young generation in Bulgaria especially uses more and more English words through exposure to English language media with Youtube and the rest of the internet and so on
When I was learning it I would confuse store and magazine, because store in Bulgarian is "magazin".
I've accidentally said I'm going "to the magazine" a few times, lol
I don't usualy mix up words but tenses I had a real hard time with
I'm a huge grammar/spelling nazi, so I don't really mix words up and I'm the one correcting everyone else (if they say it's OK, that is)
But sometimes my mouth doesn't obey me when I'm speaking too fast and I say "world" instead of "word" and vice versa
It's embarrassing because I create the impression that I really mix those two up
Vasil Levski or Ivan Vazov .The people wanted to make the first guy (Vasil Levski) a real saint, but the church did not accept that
Look him up on wikipedia, he has a n interesting story and Ivan Vazov is something like the greatest Bulgarian poet
I’d say Vasil Levski
Good luck with that
Communism
I don't know the name of the job but its about those guys who prepare the dead bodies to be buried
(Taking the body, cleaning it, sewing it, putting make up, putting ither clothes)
You just need to have a strong gut to work this kind of job
It depends on the courses of actions that the Union takes
With the most recent decisions I'd say more and more countries will be wishing to leave
Belgium, Denmark, Portugal, Spain, Norway, Italy, Austro-Hungary and Sweden also had colonial empires
Did I miss you
Wow, I don't know how that happened, I even pulled up a list of colonial powers and copied them here
Real sad Dutch noises
Nah, the Roman Empire is definitely Italian
But he's talking about colonial empires
Otherwise, we too had an empire
What I consider an empire is irrelevant
Bulgaria had an empire - this is a historic fact
Ottoman Empire was not a colonial empire
I'm sorry, but that's just disingenuous
The Romans were an ancient Italian tribe
Their descendants are the Italians right now
The Roman state is decidedly Italian
Whereas, the "Latin" legacy is just other tribes conquered by the Romans (that includes other Italian tribes) and latinized
The descendants of the people who lived in Hispania can't claim that the Roman empire (and republic) was somehow theirs
That position is one based in historic fact; the fact that one filthy regime decided to politicize it is irrelevant
Its historicity is not somehow tainted
The basic fact is that the descendants of the Ancient Romans today are called Italians (mostly from around Rome and south of it)
As I just said in another comment, the people descending from ancient tribes that were conquered and then latinized have no right to claim that their ancestors were somehow responsible for the Roman legacy
They are not
It is implied
They were fully integrated in Roman society in their lands
Because they were latinized
This has nothing to do with who is actually ruling, who is responsible for the state, who leaves a mark on history
Most of them didn't even have Roman citizenship until The Edict of Caracala in 212 AD
It's absurd to claim that the people who lived in Gallia or Hispania are somehow descendants of Romans and can lay claim to their achievements
For fuck's sake, the Roman Empire conquered the lands that are now Bulgarian, can I lay claim on the Roman Empire being my ancestors' just because some Thracians most probably fucked some Romans and 2 centuries later some Thracians most probably fucked some Bulgars and Slavs
Of course not
I agree, I said the same thing here:
I didn't say all Italians are Roman descendants, I said that the Roman descendants are Italians
But, again, that doesn't mean that the Roman legacy is somehow shared between all peoples that were conquered by Rome
Otherwise, why don't we just share Napoleon's legacy
Or Hitler's for that matter
That's not how it works
Claiming that the Roman legacy is yours if you're a Frenchman, for example, is cultural appropriation at best
And I don't think any French person would actually claim it
All European nations have vast and rich histories and cultures, there's no point in claiming someone else's.
And if I may add, because you mentioned the Fascist regime - while it is an extremely repulsive regime, they were right about one thing - you can be proud of your country's history
Of course, keeping in mind that every nation has done reprehensible things in the past
You can be proud of the Roman republic or empire, while not being proud of the genocide that Caesar performed on the Gauls or not being proud by the slavery
Mussolini politicized something normal and brought it to the extreme
But that simple thing is not inherently bad in and of itself
I couldn't remember the first part entirely so I did counsel with Google Translate to double check
Ich werde dich wie einen Eclair füllen
I'm apologize to anybody who knows German
But I regret nothing
Kuusi palaa which in Finnish apparently means  gazillion different things depending on the context
Gör Sverige lagom igen
Yes in Russian as well as in Bulgarian is spelled like that: да. Ha det bra

Krasimir Avramov with Illusion back in 2009
We only got a few points from North Macedonia and Turkey if I remember correctly
I met my best Czech friend because he decided to scream "you have big tits" in Czech to the girl who presents the new year's eve national concert in the capital
He was right behind me when he did it
The main difference is that when Austria does something stupid they kindly excuse themselves while the Germans take the beating
jk :)
It doesn’t sound weird to me because in Bulgarian it’s always been Чехия (Chehia)
Nobody says Чешка република (Cheshka republika) in everyday speech, it sounds way too official
We've always called you Чехия (Chehiya) so not much different on our side
It's weird when I see a British person, for example, say it the same way now tho
I mean Czechia is more "unique", but it sounds awful
The Czech Republic is better, but it's weird
I mean it's like saying The Bulgarian Republic instead of Bulgaria or The Slovenian Republic instead of Slovenia
Yes, but I have seen Чешка Република often
How is it better
Why would you want to say Bulgarian Republic or Italian Republic instead of Bulgaria or Italy
It is, but I was writing it as the Czech Republic is written
It's got to be [this one]
I like the current tricolour, I think green makes for a very pleasant addition to a flag
Though my favourite through history is probably [this] It would look weird right now though, since it's similar to some Nordic and UK flags (having a cross and all) and the colours are the same as (North) Macedonia's.
Wait this is an option
I love the current flag but that is incredible
Revnost - jealousy over someone's affections
Zavist - envy
Not interchangeable
We only have it as an adjective, "revnosten", meaning passionate or staunch in regards to a position - a supporter or opponent to something
Jealous, on the other hand, is "revniv".
Could be a loanword
Bulgarian borrowed heavily from Russian during our national revival
Nothing bad with mountains, they are great for defence, i've passed trough Slovenia in 2017 it was gorgeous
Italian, French, English, Greek, Russian, Finnish, Spanish, Serbian
Bulgarian - Благодаря/Мерси
Russian - Спасибо
French - Merci
German - Danke
Italian - Grazie
Spanish - Gracias
Macedonian - Фала
Serbian - Hvala
Montenegrin - Hvala
Bosnian - Hvala
Croatian - Hvala
Surprised to see that many people who knows it in Bulgarian
I hope it's not the "mersi" one which is very informal
On topic: 17 total for me - Romanian, Greek, Turkish (if we count it
), Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian, Slovenian, Ukrainian, Russian, Belarussian, German, Dutch, French, English, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese
Oh right, i forgot about it :D
Благороден - Noble
Delicious noodles
Some people here celebrate the sunrise of the 1st of July
It started as a type of peaceful protest in the 70s, ispired by the song July Morning by Uriah Heep
Usually young people gather by the sea side or up in the mountains the night before, drink, listen to music, sing or just generally chill until the morning
I think they had even started organizing festivals around it
People here are freaking rude man wtf
Like people randomly slamming the phone at me with single word answers
Happened to me more quite a few times
"Swedish steel" is still a denominative for a very high quality steel here
We used to have kings too but then the monarchy got yeeted out of existence in 1946 and with it the kings were gone too
Closest thing we have to a ruler is a Prime-Minister on the 20 leva
Controversial person named Stefan Stambolov who did some shady and almost dictatorial-like shit in the late 19th century

Bulgaria is full of seventy-something retirees who do nothing but drink rakia, discuss politics and play these two games all day, every day
Serbs would give you a good run for your money too
A TV show host/singer made a political party
It was initially rejected for "illegally using the national flag" in the logo, so he tried registering it again under a different name
The names were "Няма такава държава" ("There's no country like this", it's kind of like expressing outrage at how bad things are) and "Има такъв народ" ("There's a people like this" which sounds pretty hopeful actually)
I don't know much about them but the gist is outrage at the rampant corruption, and one of their goals is to cut the "nation's representatives" (parliament) by half
Parliament is currently at 240, I believe, and they recently gave themselves a raise
The Netherlands is definitely not big in any metric
Bulgaria is about two and a half Netherlands the size so I'd argue Bulgaria would be the smallest big country
We don't, but the state of BDZh, the company that owns and provides train services is so bad, that it is a miracle we have trains at all
I don't know if that counts as a city, but I'm gonna say Tryavna
It's a beautiful town on the northern slopes of Stara planina with lots of culture and traditions from the Revival period
I absolutely adore Veliko Tarnovo
The city is located on the two hills, separated by a river, it's a steep walk around the centre and it's best to visit it in the spring and summer, because everything around the city is green and due to the hilly character of the city forests around the city are visible and it is just so lush, green and calm
We went to the morgue when I was in the end of elementary school
For sure, it made me ready for high school
Absolutely no Sex Ed
We had a presentation about puberty when we were around 6th grade, and some mention of sex was probably there, too, but the primary thing was that they split the girls and boys in separate rooms for the presentation
The girls got the menstruation talk, no idea about the boys
At this point all of us had already watched porn and most of us were probably masturbating
We've had teachers between 7th and 10th grade taking the time in their class (homeroom or biology, usually) to dive into the topic of their own volition, read informative texts or show movies that educate about how easily HIV can be transferred, and talk about wet dreams and horniness rather than actual sex
In 11th or 12th grade, we had a very graphic presentation (again, split rooms between girls and boys) about STDs that read entirely as fear-mongering to me though I understand the need to promote SAFE sex, it felt like it was to dissuade us from sex at all
Also, it was very late in my opinion - by age 17, the more socially active people in my class were already sexually active
The lot of us learned the majority of what we know from porn, hear-say, and awkward first hand experience
School just explained the cellular level of things
I don't remeber my parents giving me "the talk" neither my school offered sex ed classes
It was porn and internet all along, and i had internet access in 6th grade
Well they are curently trying to start sex ed in 3rd grade
Why does an extra large pizza cost €40
I once read that Sweden was the largest holder of North Korean debt in the world

Every English speaker messes up the name of Sofia - they pronounce it like the female name, instead of how we call it - with the stress on the "o".
Реално на испански е Sofía, даже така си го пишат, с акцента, защото иначе ще се произнася Sófia, голям сакън
Are you from Save Sofia
I knew I have heard your name before, it just took me a few minutes to realise I actually voted for you :D I am surprised to see you on reddit and hope to see Save Sofia on the next elections as well
Good luck
Yeah - the British and the Americans shift the stress to the end of the word, instead the beginning
Siendo búlgara en España, me reí de esto más de lo normal jajajaja
Thank you for your vote :)

It was established by Bulgarians :)
Jajajaja, lo se, por eso me reí tanto
Once you're going to the south, beyond melnik is the middle of nowhere for me
Not saying it's a bad place but there's just nothing
I don't really know
I think most of the country is evenly populated so there aren't any places where you are far away from a major city or a town
But I would probably say somewhere in the Rodopa mountain range
I dunno, I've gotten lost with the car in some pretty "middle of nowhere" regions trying to get to zermatt
Joke is on me, to the rest of Europe Bulgaria either doesn't exist or is some enigmatic twilight zone of mystery
Urbanisation is huge here
Villages and small towns are very depopulated
I've been noticing more life in recent years though
I think two groups contribute to this
First are younger people that move out of big cities and buy some house closeby on the cheap, all while continuing working their jobs remotely, planning to do the same in the next years
The other group of people are the expats, which, for the most part, are a very welcome addition
Most are very respectful, learn the language and adopt local customs
All my homies gtfo off Sofia to someplace else thanks to covid enabling them to work remotely
Yup, just came back to this concrete slum after spending 2 weeks in the Elena Balkan at my cousin's. Shit was magical, I can understand why they do it
But not having the homies is a bit of a downside, yes
Exactly
And i'm not joking, basically everyone i know who isn't bound to an office job or a girlfriend is gone
People tell me i'm crzy for paying rent in Sofia when home office from a cleaner,more peaceful and cheaper place is an option
Haha yeah
My cousin slapped his forehead when I told him the rent I pay in Lozenets
It's not all bad about Sofia, but some things you just can't really argue with
Moving out into the countryside is cool if you have a family and kids, but as a young guy, it sound terribly boring
I see why some people go for it though
I don't know but some warning signs (or rather, slogans) made during communist times were downright hilarious
Such as:
"Look both ways before crossing
One second of inattention, dead for life
"Be careful on the road
There are no spare parts for the human body
Vinetka
This sign strikes fear in everyone, cause the road after it is toll-controlled and its often very badly maintained
Generally people wouldn't tell the difference between Rugby or American Football, but we got some fans of both
Milk here is always refrigerated
Eggs can stay on room temperature, but most people refrigerate them anyway
We use our variant of QWERTY (ЯВЕРТЪ), but some psychopaths use ЧШЕРТЪ or ",УЕИШЩ" (the latter being the officially accepted one, yikes)
In English and French, I use QWERTY
The keyboard of my phone combines the two in one keyboard so I can just long press if I want say, à. On my laptop, I have shortcuts (like ` + a = à)
In Bulgaria, we have a layout called Bulgarian Phonetic, which basically maps out the Cyrillic letters to a corresponding latin character
It follows the QWERTY layout (so A goes to A, E goes to E and say, Б goes to be, as it shares the same phonetic sound)
For Russian, I only ever use it on my phone so I usually type on the Bulgarian keyboard and then switch over to the Russian keyboard when I'm missing a letter
Some letters are placed differently on the Russian keyboard so it slows me down
I'm still learning Chinese but I'm otherwise practicing with a pinyin keyboard
It follows QWERTY again
Pinyin basically uses the latin letters to show how a character is read
When typing on a keyboard in pinyin, you will be suggested different characters that correspond to the pinyin and make the most sense
In short - QWERTY but different flavours
As far as I know, this is a macro for apostrophizing vowels in all UK-based keyboards, including the Danish one
While the UK may have a good amount of Roman sites preserved, I would like to argue that places like Greece and Spain have just as many if not even more so I don't think the answer is as "easy" as some people would like to think
On the other hand, the fact you do not see many people in the UK taking pride in their Roman heritage and even outright mocking it may be exactly because they don't have as strong a relation to it culturally
If anything I would argue that there is just as big of an amount of British people proud of the British Empire as there are Italian people proud of the Roman Empire and Greek people proud of Ancient Greece
Fucking northeners man
With such a system, how do you replace the iconic 'hey guys, I brought beer

I don't think I need to explain how
People in the West laugh at people with Eastern dialects and vice versa
People speaking in the dialect used in Sofia are usually seen as stuck up in the East, while an Easterner speaking in their soft tongue in the West (especially in Sofia) will be singled out as "a provincialist".
Bulgarians have more than 200 dialects, so almost every city has its own accent, specific words and phrases and manner of speaking, so many people can't and don't care
People from the Rhodopes speak in a very ancient dialect that is almost unintelligible to the rest of us, while people from Pirin Macedonia speak in the same dialect used by North Macedonia
Nope
It's hard to imagine something like that working here
[Boza] really good, many people don't like it but twice as many love it

We have 7 cultural and 3 natural World Heritage sites
Here are the cultural ones
Ancient City of Nessebar - Initially a Thracian settlement from 3000 bc, then a Greek colony, then Byzantine, then Bulgarian etc
Really beautiful place with plenty of architecture from various periods
Boyana Church - A 10-12th century church with some very well preserved medieval frescoes
Madara Rider - One of the few remnants we have of the Bulgars
The Mada rider is carved into a 100-m-high cliff near the village of Madara in north-east Bulgaria and has an engraving by one of Bulgaria's early khans
Rila Monastary - Founded in the 10th century by St John of Rila, or more correctly by the students that came to visit him
It became a haven for Bulgarians during the Ottoman days and is probably the spiritual center of Bulgaria
Rock-Hewn Churches of Ivanovo - A complex of rock-hewn churches, chapels, monasteries and cells developed in the vicinity of the village of Ivanovo
Built between 12-14th century
Thracian Tomb of Kazanlak - Dates to the Hellenistic period, around the end of the 4th century BC
It is located near Seutopolis, the capital city of the Thracian king Seutes III
Contains very well preserved murals and paintings
Thracian Tomb of Sveshtari - Discovered in 1982 near the village of Sveshtari, this 3rd-century BC Thracian tomb reflects the fundamental structural principles of Thracian cult buildings
The tomb has a unique architectural decor, with polychrome half-human, half-plant caryatids and painted murals
The 10 female figures carved in high relief on the walls of the central chamber and the decoration of the lunette in its vault are the only examples of this type found so far in the Thracian lands
We have 10 [UNESCO world heritage sites] 8 historical, 3 natural
**Historical heritage**
* [Ancient city of Nesebar] \- a tourist hotspot and coastal resort
The old city is very beautiful;
* [Boyana Church] \- a medieval church with wall murals painted in the rare Paleologue Renaissance style;
* [Madara Rider] \- a stone carving of a horseman, sprearing a lion
It is believed to be made to commemorate Khan Tervel;
* [Rila Monastery] \- a 10th century monastery that is also the largest one in the country and named after the patron saint of the Bulgarian nation;
* [Rock-Hewn Churches of Ivanovo] \- monastic shelter built into the rocks near Ivanovo from the 1200s;
* [Kazanlak Thracian tomb] \- the tomb of a Thracian ruler;
* [Sveshtari Thracian tomb] \- another Thracian ruler tomb
Natural heritage
* [Central Balkan beech forest] \- a centuries-old forest in the central Stara planina;
* [Pirin Natural park] \- one of the highest mountains in Bulgaria and the Balkans, preserving alpine and subglacial natural habitats;
* [Srebarna lake] \- a lake used by dozens or endangered species as a resting stop along their migratory path
Turkey probably has at least another few hidden away undiscovered yet
Should you buy from big foreign company chains (like Lidl and Kaufland) that often get their produce from abroad but often offer much better prices and overall customer experience or support domestic businesses and shop in small local markets that have local produce but have higher prices and often aren't as convenient or as pleasentto shop in (don't have certain categories of items, staff are often rude and act like they are doing you a favour by being there and often haggle for things like items warranty and defective items)
Like, I want to support local producers and businesses but not at the expense of customer experience, warranty of the purchased items and 20-50% higher prices
New Bulgaria
Because there was Old Bulgaria in the region of Crimea in the 6th century
We Bulgarians agree our name is perfect as it is
But I come with a fantastic suggestion for all Eastern (and some Central) European countries: "Not Russia".
Just get a good ol' map and write "Not Russia", "Still Not Russia", "Definitely Not Russia", "Not Even The Same Language Family as Russia", "Not Siberia", etc
I was very surprised to find out that's what it's called in English
You'll always be Hrvatska to any Slavic-speaking nations at least
I know just can't think of other name than Bulgaria
I agree
Istvan, one of the coolest names I've heard
Where do you think alexei comes from
He's bullshitting you, most likely he was trying to sell you the idea of "Europe" consisting only of upscale places in order to sound fancy
When I arrived in Germany, I was astounded by the amount of North Face and Jack Wolfskin logos on people's jackets and backpacks
In Bulgaria it's mostly things like Adidas and Nike as well as smaller brands
That's strange I always thought Ukrainians had a bad opinion of Russia
I really thought you guys hated them even before Crimea
Bulgaria surnames end in ov/ ova or ski/ska
They usually come for the jobs that these people's predecessors had or their names
Middle names also end the same way but they usually come from you dad's name
Ex: Your name is Boris, your dad's name is Kostadin and your surname is Kupenov (this comes from the name for the people who were gardeners for Ottoman officials during those times) --> your full name is Boris Kostadinov Kupenov
No, but I do feel extremely annoyed by the deliberate insistance of English speakers on not learning or even trying to learn how to pronounce names in other languages
Names should not be translated or even transformed to fit the pronunciation of some language
They should be said the same way they are in the native tongue
And the fact that literally no English speaker even tries to do that is infuriating
How can we learn how to pronounce names in Russian, German, Italian, Spanish, French, English and even Polish, but you can't?
I like languages and nuance, so I'm not resentful towards the language itself
As some other people said - the entitlement of some native English speakers is definitely something to roll our eyes at
Don't go to a country with a completely different language without knowing some BASIC sentences, like asking if they speak English, being able to ask for help, or even "thank you
" Yes, your hotel will likely be okay with just English but don't get moody about how the small local pub's staff doesn't speak it, or how the cab driver isn't bilingual, aight
I only resent how people (Bulgarians) tend to elevate it over our own language sometimes, in the sense of "coolness".
Advertisers do this most but commercial artists (singers) add random English phrases or word into their shit, and it's not only annoying and unoriginal - it's nonsensical
We have singers who add phrases that they barely even understand, butcher the grammar and pronunciation, and the idea is that it's "cool".
Another example is something I find with translations of English source material
If something means, quite literally "Blackwood" or "Red rock" or something along those lines, in the sense of conveying the meaning rather than an individual name, people are more likely to use that "original English" way of refering to it, rather than the equally applicable version from our own language
Isn't French still a lingua franca in some parts of Africa and the Middle East
Когато Петър е "Питър", Сара е "Серъ", Хриси е "Криси", а фамилиите ни ги отебали тотално :')
Well yeah, Arabic is a definite lingua franca in North Africa and the Middle East
But I'm pretty sure French was used in that part of the world much like we currently use English, I'm just not sure when exactly it changed
We're kind of all just eyeing Turkey quietly
largely in relation to the "refugee crisis" and their government in general
Definately Serbia
Our foreign policy leans mostly towards the EU and NATO, while Serbia is much closer to Russia
Since April, Serbia is our only neighbour that isn't a member of NATO
There is also the whole Kosovo thing
Personally I don't think that there will be an outright war between my country and Serbia in the near future, but we definately aren't as close to them as our other neighbours
> Bulgaria  - We are in a very good relationship at the moment but there is still controversy around Dobruja
I haven't seen any animosity about Dobruja for a long while
I think as far as ex-Bulgarian territories go, that one is least talked about just because we're basically experiencing the best relations we've ever had with each other
>Bulgaria  - We are in a very good relationship at the moment but there is still controversy around Dobruja
Really
Apart from a few fringe Romanian nationalists claiming southern Dobruja as part of Greater Romania, I can't see any  controversy there
Isn't that "**countries** whose nationalists want to slaughter you"
What else is different in your alternate universe, apart from Bulgaria not bordering Turkey and Serbia being even potentially a threat to Bulgaria
It is highly unlikely that any of our neighbours would attack us
OP asked about the most probable one, not one with actual high chances to invade
Also, why would Turkey try to attack us
Nah, I think we really do have relatively good relations with them at the moment
I'll be glad if it stays that way, but it's disconcerting how your relations with them have deteriorated
>It is highly unlikely that any of our neighbours would attack us
OP asked about the most probable one, not one with actual high chances to invade
The answer to this question is also Turkey
They are the only one of our neighbors who have plausible reasons to want to invade us and the only one who is capable of succeeding
This is not even remotely true for Serbia (outside of some fantasy where the Russian army teleports to Serbia and uses it as a base of invasions) .
>Also, why would Turkey try to attack us
Take your pick:
Turkish nationalists want to bring the Bulgarian Turks back to the fatherland
Neo-Ottomanists want to restore the Ottoman Empire
Islamists want to restore a formerly Muslim territory in its rightful position in the [Dar al-Islam]
And all these groups are far from marginal in Turkey
Fuck this one hits hard as someone with close ties to the Dutch healthcare system
I know a fair amount about Northern African countries
Go South though and I'll have a problem
Hmmm I think the april uprising would make for a very interesting assassins creed game
I would go with the years under Ottoman yoke leading to the Liberation of Bulgaria - a time of хайдути (haiduti), legions that were prepared from abroad, organising the peoples in secret for an uprising
Yup, every year
Yes, definetely
[The Irony of Fate]
And for younger folks I'd say Love Actually but maybe it's just my friend circle
Bulgarians have a joke going that we understand everyone's language but nobody understands ours
80 - 90% - Most Bulgarians can understand Macedonian perfectly but there are some words that are just different, or have a completely different meaning in Bulgarian, so that's where I get confused
I think their regional accents also have a role in that though
50 - 70% - Serbian tends to be very slow and kind of deep, so that makes it easier to understand, though the lexical differences are solid
I can say they share a lot of words with us but for us, those words would often be "archaic" or only really used in very old texts, or different context
40 - 60% - Czech is very easy to understand, in my opinion
It's not as similar as Macedonian or Serbian but it's not too bad
It's easier for me to understand all of these languages when written
40 - 60% Russian is actually extremely difficult, and my comprehension comes from having studied it
The lexical differences are much bigger, and the grammar is insanely different
Russians do not understand other Slavic languages AT ALL, in my experience, with some of the people I've met (who work with other Slavic people all the time
) we might as well have been speaking Chinese
30 - 50% - I can't speak for other languages because I haven't really encountered them much, but Polish is probably the hardest to understand
Plenty of similar words, spelled differently but comprehensible
Slavic languages are notoriously high in mutual intelligibility, so I would say to a large degree
It's really just that the mutual intelligibility is very uneven - speakers of one language understand the others more so than they understand them back
(Polish understand Czech more than Czech understand Polish, Bulgarians understand Serbian more than the other way around etc
**Macedonian**, unsurprisingly, I understand 95% to 100%. It's basically the Southwestern Bulgarian dialect, but dialed up to 11 and with special orhography and random Serbian loanwords
It's very easy for us both written and spoken
**Russian** around 65% to 70%. It's very akin to archaic Bulgarian
Both written and spoken it's quite understandable, and we only need a little bit of learning and preparation to be able to write and speak in it too
**Serbian** I would say 55% to 60%. Written I can understand the meaning almost all the time
Spoken I can understand the jist of it but it takes a lot of focus to follow and won't work all the time
Still, Bulgarian and Serbian are more similar than different
With **Croatian** sometimes it's a bit easier than Serbian, but it's mostly the same
I can't hear any difference from Serbian with Bosnian and Montenegrin
With **Slovene** it's 35% to 40%, it's very similar to Serbian but there's so many words that throw me off
**Ukrainian** 20-30%. This is the last one which I would say is understandable to me, even if only at times
It's a very melodic and beautiful language, but it really depends from sentence to sentence whether I can get the meaning or if it's complete gibberish to me
**Slovak** 10-15% - Mostly gibberish, but noticeably more understandable than Czech and Polish
**Czech** - 5% - 10% - Gibberish for the most part, with the occasional familiar word
Can tell it apart from Slovak and Polish, though, so there's some degree of passive knowledge I have in it just from being a slavic speaker, which is the only notable part
**Polish** 5% - Least understandable slavic language to me
Pronunciation is a big reason for that, it sounds very confusing and the orthography is equally puzzling
I'll get the ocasional word but that's about it
With Sorbian, Belarusian and Rusyn I have basically had no contact so I cannot say
All slavic languages have wild amounts of similarities
The real trouble for me starts with Czech and intensifies with Polish
Macka can mean cat in Bulgarian as well, or a girl/"bird".
Lol didn't even try Bulgarian :(
And then 10% - thick rhodope dialect
Afrikaans is cheating
It's just outdated Dutch with broken grammar to a Dutch speaker
Try out some Kerkrade or "kierkroois"
My dialect is Rhodopean and I will forever resent my parents for being 'fluent' in it but never teaching me to speak it
It's really fascinating
Yeah I second that
Same here
Our language/dialect is авелзаманско but such is life
At least what we can do is try and document as much of it as possible so that it can never die out
Huh haven't seen Bulgaria here yet
Don't we have a special killing method
Umbrella
Death by
Uuhhmm
Playing 15000 kaba gaidas right into your ears :P
In Bulgaria, we have these so called 'language schools'. Your class profile consists of 2 languages - in my case, which I'll use as an example, they were French as a first language and Russian as a second
In 8th grade, I would learn only French, Math, Bulgarian, IT, Music, Art and PE
In 9th grade, all other subjects were added back, along with Russian
Up until 11th grade, we would study History, Biology and Geography in French
It's different in every school though - but it's usually between Math, Biology, Chemistry, History, Geography and Physics
We didn't study anything in Russian but we did study Russian literature
The amount of French and Russian classes also increased every year and near the end, we would study French in French and Russian by mixing Bulgarian and Russian depending on what we were learning
I can't speak for non-language schools but it is staple in every language school and they are fairly common
From what I know there aren't any separatist movements in Bulgaria
Even in places like Kardzali and Razgrad where the majority of people are Turkish ethnically, there arent movements for secession
Although during the 70s and 80s, the communist government thought that Turkish people held a way too positive view of Turkey and that they might want autonomy or more, but the communists were also paranoid idiots so who knows
As far as I’m aware we don’t have one
According to Wikipedia, you have more:
Same in Bulgarian, pronounced the same way as the Romanian - we don't differentiate between rifles and shotguns
We only have one word for lawyer - advokat (advocate but pronounced a bit differently) but English has tons of words - litigator, barrister, attorney, solicitor
Земя (zemya) - Earth, soil and ground
In Russian it also works like this
We just
know
People usually know what happens more often and think about it unless you give them some other context
It's hard  to feel lack of something in you language
For example, I can write "Yesterday I bought my first dildo" and you now have no idea what kind of mental image to have about it
:)  But in Russian you would immediately know my gender
In English you either don't know at all or assume, based on your set of stereotypes
Personally I identify with Europe (i.e. it's values), culturally I also identify with Balkan and Slavic states, we have quite a lot in common (listening to the same kind of music, laughing at the same jokes, having similar folklore and traditions, etc)
I wouldn't say I identify with my city/region that much as I have moved a few times and like all places equally
I played A LOT in the street with friends, marbles, skating, climbing trees
My absolute favourite was role playing Blake's 7 which due to some magic had made it through the Iron Curtain
We made teleportation wristbands from scotch tape rolls
And then of course, playing at the beach
With sand and sticks and shells
Amazing times
Yea , my personal top 3 are :
Rural - I sound like a broken motorcycle, just , RUuuRr
World - Here the sound for me is closer to Woorrd,  that danm L
Literally - again the danm Ls , from my mouth it sound closer to  Litri , Litrali,  something along those lines
As a Russian - England
I fell that two things are almost identical - darker, self-deprecating sence of humour and the way we speak
You know these lists like "What the British say and what they really mean"?  Yeah, we do it too and everything in this lists is usually very obvious to me
Plus, all the imperial/colonial past and baggage is also very similar in pretty much all ways you can imagine
We can take every shitty thing UK did or does in these areas and find something matching in areas surrounding Russia
We have a village called "Churka" which means "dick"
There is a town in Bulgaria called "Дупница" (Dupnitsa) which literally translates to Assville
There is also a village called "Крайници" (Kraynitsi) which translates to limbs
wasn't there something about the route being changed but the chaffeur not being notified
Mmmm cyka blyat, are you speaking Russian ?
And I'm mindblowned
Hopefully I haven't met that many stupid foreigners
From a neighboring country: "Aah
" kind of like a "That makes sense
" type of reaction
"Oh wow, that's like, far away
" when Americans usually don't know anything except the name but they're pretty nice
Sometimes they ask basic questions like "What's it like
", even though they can be a little embarrassed
I don't think there's anything to be embarrassed about though, you can't know everything about everywhere
I was once told "Huh, I've never seen a bulgarian who can speak English
" by a man checking my passport
He came off as pretty rude, specifically when I said "Well plenty of them do
" and he said "The ones that come here don't." Based on the percentage of people I've personally met who study their classes in English there
incorrect
'' Oh, I thought you were American
No reaction at all
You mean no one's ever pulled the ol' "Oh, like Siberia
In Russia
" on you
Tbh there isn't a "set" Turkish look
Darker hair and eyes are definitely more common but you'll find plenty blonde, blue eyed people, and varying skin tones
Coast of Bulgaria - for a hour or something, and it melted right after
We have the same thing here as well, their commercials are super long and scripted, the products are terrible and the prices are high
Honestly, all of the iconic ones I can think of right now are staged portraits
Maybe I'm blanking on some others, and other countrymen can chime in
The most iconic ones would then be of our national hero - Vasil Levski, a Bulgarian revolutionary, known also as The Apostle of Freedom, he ideologised and strategised a revolutionary movement to liberate Bulgaria from Ottoman rule
I personally like [this very popular portrait of his] posing in his revolutionary uniform
Though [this smaller portrait] is the one most used and reproduced, you'd see it anywhere in Bulgaria, so I guess it's the most iconic one
If we're talking more viral and recent ones, I'd say [this photo of a girl and policeman during 2013 protests] agains corrupt government is also one that made the rounds
It's a great photo, maybe a bit overdramatised though
It still does speak tons of current times and recent protests though, so it's iconic
The most beautiful sounding language is, undoubtedly, the one the person you love is using to speak to you
Amongst languages I don't speak, I'd say Scottish Gaelic, Italian, Turkish
pretty much every language is beautiful but these are some of my top choices
Italian is hands down the most beautiful and especially musical language I've heard
I also like Welsh, Japanese and a host of others
There are very few languages I dislike the sound of
French
When a woman speaks it it makes me melt
Portuguese, Faroese and the Celtic languages
Yes, during the third monarchy the Great Powers installed Western nobles as our monarchs, first Alexander of Battenberg and then Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha
Alexander was badass, but overall it was a move to make us a puppet to the league of three emperors and later Austria/Germany
Yes, bouth price/tsar [Alexander Battenberg ] and prince/tsar [Ferdinand ]  were not born in Bulgaria
After our liberation from Ottoman rule, the first two of our monarchs were German
Yes, the young Bulgarian principality and then kingdom were ruled by foreigners
The first prince Batenberg was an Austrian with familial ties to Alexander II of Russia, the second prince and later Tsar was also an Austrian noble
Was he the guy who was not executed in one uprising because he was American (well had american passport I guess)
Same in Bulgaria
Here we have this thing called Name days, it is as the name suggests - a celebration of your name
It comes from the Christian (Ortodox) beliefs that the name you are given is holy and thus should be celebrated
The the 6th of January is Йорданов ден (Jordanov den) day of the name Jordan, also knows as Богоявление (when God has appeared)
It is believed that Jesus was baptized in the river Jordan on this day and God appeared and acknowledged that he is indeed his son
The celebration is an odd one - a cross is thrown in the river from a priest and young men swim or run (depending on how shallow it is) in the water to race and retrieve it
This is considered to clense the water (holy water) and everyone attending takes some home with them
And yes, this is done in the freezing cold waters of January, though it is considered to be done for health
Yordanovden - the catching of the cross, the [Ice dance] in Tundzha, but this year most of these events won't be happening
The song that recently became a traditional part of the horo is called "Vasilka fell in love" and its about a girl that has fallen in love with two guys and has to choose between them
It's probably not the most famous in Bulgaria but it's definitely at the top
It's from Peyo Yavorov's poem- Two beautiful eyes
>Две хубави очи. Душата на дете
в две хубави очи; - музика - лъчи
>Two beautiful eyes
The soul of a child
in two beautiful eyes;-music-rays
It's about his love for an underaged girl which he couldn't marry/be together with because her father forbid them
A year or two later she died from cancer and he wasn't allowed to say goodbye with her, go to her funeral
"На къде душата ми да бяга, и къде да скрия своите сълзи?" from "Ice Queen" by Vasil Boyanov
"Where would my soul go, where should I hide my tears
Yes
She's the sister of another less popular writer, who was also part of the "Thought" literature group
What's more fucked up is what happens after that
The daughter of the Prime Minister falls in love with Peyo Yavorov and sort of stalks him until he marries her
She was used to getting all she wanted in life, so it wasn't something unusual
He did have feelings for her, he wrote poems about her as well, but it was obvious they weren't as good/passionate as the ones for the underaged girl
The Prime Minister's daughter progressively got more jealous and one night it escalated to the point where she reportedly grabbed his gun and pointed it to her heart
Thinking it's not loaded, she pulled the trigger, but it was so she killed herself
Yavorov then tried to shoot himself in the head but the bullet went through his temporal bone, he survived the suicide attempt but was left blind
After that people thought he had killed her so the public's opinion turned against him and many court trials were started against him by her mom/father
One year after the accident he drank poison and shot himself in the head, this time successful
Yeah I don't think we ever will be either
We have Ikea since the early 00s, and its known as a high end furniture store
We shouldn't have to rely on it, but here we are
And in exchange for them potentially scaring Russia off, we get dragged into America's wars
All the Balkans yoghurts are amazing
Most countries have their own style and have perfected it
I buy Polish cheeses every week
There definitely are imported groceries, but only some specific products
Most are either homegrown or from neighbouring countries
There are in the Netherlands
Haven't seen it in Bulgaria yet (though we do have some Russian stores)
This was the best Yugoslavia documentary I have ever seen
I'm sorry, but how can the history of one of the regions of Europe not even be mentioned
Nobody ever talked about Vikings in your History class
It's just bulgarian history
What the hell
We were taught about the history of every region in Europe
Including Scotland, for example
>The Vikings were also only mentioned when it came to the expansion of the Roman Empire in Europe
The Viking age started about 300 years after the Roman Empire fell (at least the Western one)
It seems your History classes really were shit
Probably like 1230s or something
I want to see my hometown (Veliko Tarnovo) when it was the capital of an empire and its beauty and wealth was compared to that of Constantinople
Either the short time between the Balkan wars or during Simeon's golden century
Probably before the bulgars came to the balkans
We dont know much about it so it'd be cool to see and understand what they did
If that doesn't count then during the period with Khan Krum
I wonder if he would allow me to get a skull cup
any time from the 8th of Octomber 1912 to 30th of May 1913
Some of the accents in the Rhodopes are very weird and sometimes hard to understand
Maybe also close to serbia
It used to be we have our first snowfall at the end of October, then nothing until Christmas, when it would start a day or two before, and we'd have snow until some time in March
Now maybe we get a bit of snow during January and February
Had one crazy late snowfall a couple years ago around mid-April, if I remember correctly
Small piercings are often seen on people working in business buildings
I don’t think a single piercing will cause issues but larger ones are are frowned upon
We separate the thousands with intervals and use both dots and commas for the decimal
So 10 000 000
00 and 10 000 000,00 are both right
It seems that there's been a rise in Eastern Orthodox believers in the last 10 years (according to wikipedia) and overall, I'd say it's only an issue if you bring it up during a religious holiday/ceremony or if you're in a smaller, rural area
More younger people are likely to identify themselves as undecided or atheist than older generations
I feel like there's definitely a predominant *Casual Christian* attitude, and going against that norm will certainly ruffle some feathers
i.e: if you refuse to respectfully acknowledge or participate in these holidays (such as Christmas, Easter, and several smaller ones) you're likely to get some abuse from people - relatives, peers, strangers on facebook, whatever
If you voice your differing beliefs that go against the dogmatic principles you're likely to get shut down
(And I don't meant the AlL rElIgIoNs ArE EvIl AnD sTuPiD type of atheist, I mean somebody even making a dry joke about the timeline of Easter or something that's not even *offensive*.)
Our priests have no concept of tolerating anything but absolute unquestioning subordination from their flock
Certainly not exclusive to the religion here, though I've seen very inviting pastors and priests in different Christian denominations
Younger people don't care
Older people may question you
Currently we're more concered with some other leaders being ridiculous (something about a guy carrying around a supermarket bag) but our Prime Minister is a meme *goldmine*.
He started out as a bodyguard, so a lot of the things we make fun of is how thuggish he is
His language (as in, the sort of speech he uses) is very informal, he sounds like the type of dude your dad used to go drinking with and would occasionally ask you to buy them cigarettes when you were 12 because they didn't want to get up from their spot in the café outside your apartment building
So we really like to take the piss about his colourful vernacular
Here in my country we laughed because a person of his position married his teacher
People thought that he is dumb and jokingly or not started saying to their kids not to even think about marrying their teachers
>Будапеща
Budapeshta
The "sht" is written with the letter [щ] You can hear how it's said in Bulgarian in [this video] at the 00:42 mark
For some reason we kept the "a" at the end
I once heard it's because the name entered Bulgarian vernacular when the fortress became a border post when the First Bulgarian Empire expanded as far as there during the rule of Khan Krum
* German, because I kind of like the language and would visit Germany again
* French, because I want to live in Montreal in Canada eventually
* Japanese, because I like hentai
Mandarin Chinese, Japanese and C++.
Mandarin Chinese - I'm actually already learning this but I'm at a beginner level, so the effort lost wouldn't be much
It's definitely an interesting language and has the added benefit of being useful as well
Japanese - I like Japanese culture, plus I'd love to work in either Japan or Korea
I want to develop games and the best industry for that is Japan, currently
C++ - If I could automatically understand pointers, memory allocation and all that jazz, that would be amazing
If computer languages aren't acceptable, I'd go for Korean - same reasons as Japan, obviously
How come you're learning Bulgarian
But Hindi means turkey in Turkey
That's very awesome of you, I can guarantee they will all appreciate it a lot
I tried pronouncing that several times and I gotta say it sounds a lot like the way some people speak Bulgarian, where the vowels are shortened so much that they hardly exist
Countries affected by USSR influence in the past, what is your opinion on the Soviet monuments constructed in your countries
As we all know, the Soviets built a lot of communist monuments related to the Soviet presence in the chosen country, for various reasons
I know that in Poland they have removed almost all of them
If I am not mistaken
Please comment to explain more in-depth the situation
In Czechia they are in the process of removing some of them now
Again comment here also for a better explanation
In Bulgaria, well the population is rather divided on this topic (young vs old)
I honestly don't understand why are we keeping them
I was born way after '89 so this history is nothing to me
They are architecturally ugly and do nothing except divide the population
There are a lot of people (boomers in particular) who will defend these "monuments" with their lives and go and bring flowers to them (like wtf, honestly
) I wasn't really interested in history and when I learned that the Soviets in the end of WW2, when we were allies with the Axis and before the end of the war we switched sides with the Allies, declared war on Bulgaria, invaded as, abolished the monarchy with a fake referendum with 95
6% in favor (yeah right) and made a communist/Soviet puppet state, but some people say they liberated us, like wtf again
I honestly, don't understand these boomers why they defend these monuments with their lives (brainwashed)
We were not under prosecution or occupation from other nations at the time, so the Soviets had no reason to come
Facts state that they declared war on us and occupied us
We were perfectly fine without their occupation
That is why I don't understand why we are keeping these monuments
Bulgaria was founded in 681 and now if you come and visit Bulgaria you will be surrounded with history predominately from the communist era (44 years)
Call me crazy but, I rather see history from the rest 1339 years when Bulgaria also existed one way or another, which is authentic Bulgarian (not commie blocks, foreign monuments of a foreign country and foreign people and very very bad architecture)
Please feel free to comment your opinion about this, whether you are from a country which had USSR influence or not (you can say your opinion from a 3rd perspective and what would you do with the monuments if this happened to you country)
Do you approve of these monuments or disapprove and what are their current status in your countries
I have said it when the demolition of the 1300 years Bulgaria memorial started - the place of the Soviet "Liberators" Army monument is in the Totalitarian Art Museum in Darvenitsa, 1300 years Bulgaria [should have been restored] and slightly modernised and the Memorial of First and Sixth Infantry Regiments should be in the Knyazheska gradina at the place of the Soviet soldier
This way they can be the start/end point of military ceremonies, the May 6th Parade can end there and the new Memorial can be developed as an Honorary guard of Alexander I Battenberg Mausoleum - you know, the first ruler of Liberated Bulgaria
But I guess it could be worse - they could've made this [hideous Skopje 2014 looking shit] around the lion
imo they should just be moved somewhere
Not destroyed just moved and whoever is interested should be allowed to visit them
They didn't liberate shit
The regime started with unfair "trials" that executed hundreds of teachers, doctors, journalists - people capable of thought and influence
I agree that it's a part of our history but it's largely propagating lies
We have better things to do than get rid of everything, in terms of infrastructure, but many of these moments don't deserve shit
(Some, which happen to be built in the Soviet era but are otherwise unrelated to it, are fine
The one I feel we should have kept is the Mausoleum
It would have made for a fantastic space, and location to be repurposed into a museum documenting the ills of totalitarianism, and the symbol of using that building would have been immense
Also, the destruction was comical, and we continue to have an empty space there
As with the monument of 1300, it should have been restored, and an plaque put up documenting what it was while also acknowledging the failures of socialist rule
It’s just awkward as is
We have all these empty or former spaces, that we all know what they used to house
It’s a monument without a monument
I think it would be easier to create one giant hill (around 70 m or what
) and bury that shitty statue under it, as one architect did indeed propose
That way the old retirees won't be that outraged that we "destroy history".
I disagree
A monument standing is a monument inspiring
It might have no effect on you but be sure there are people who would love to see the DDR or the USSR back
If one has to tolerate the monuments of criminal and dehumanizing regimes like the communist one, why not do the same for the Nazi monuments
What about what other countries think about your country having certain statues
After all Russia lost the Cold war and will soon lose the new economic war again
I'm surprised they haven't removed it, considering they destroyed the [Kutaisi war memorial] and that was dedicated to Georgian soldiers who died in WWII
And collapse the metro tunnels of M1, 3 and 4 with the extra weight
No thank you
>It would have made for a fantastic space, and location to be repurposed into a museum documenting the ills of totalitarianism, and the symbol of using that building would have been immense
Agreed
Same goes for Buzludzha
Although
I kinda like the openness without it and the possibilities for a fully pedestrian Battenberg Sq
The subterranean levels of the Tomb are still intact and they can be used for something
Also
And this isn’t nearly as relevant
Buzludzha is an amazing looking building
It’s space ship in the middle of the wilderness
The subterranean levels of the tomb are actually a fallout shelter with the additional infrastructure for preserving the museum's mummy
As the structure above is already destroyed for good, the fallout shelter was abandoned but preserved
Currently the municipality is turning it into a [mixed structure] with an art gallery and a historical museum
Yeah
But you should definitely destroy the ugly Lenin statues and create one big statue of the great Reagan in front of the Kremlin
After all it was him who destroyed the Empire of Evil
Just to remind you every day about the criminal and primitive regime that you had and the (literally) human cost of sustaining it - GULAGs, repressions and wars
The regime you couldn't take down yourself so that the Americans had to do it for you
I know the architect researcher who made the proposal
I haven’t heard that they are starting to work on it tho
This happens here as well but mostly at less known pubs where 90% of the customers are just people from the neighbourhood :D
All police here have pistols,  but it's quite rare to see someone with bigger gun like rifle or other weapon
Every cop is armed here
However I have never seen a police officer drawing their gun
I have never seen a real gun firing - I've seen gas pistols and firework guns fire tho
The Americas are two continents
Oceania is not a continent - Australia is and Oceania contains Australia, the Pacific islands and New Zealand
The Indonesian archipelago is considered as part of Asia
I was touth about North and South America,  Australia and Oceania
I don't know if it is changed in the current educational system
They taught us both geographical definition and topographic in the early 00s. Greenland is still Danish, but it is considered part of the North American landmass
We were taught that Australia encompasses Astralasia, Micronesia, Melanesia and Polynesia
In bulgarian I guess the only weird thing that I can think about besides double negatives, is that we describe forest with the word гора (Gora) and mountain with планина (planina) which kind of doesn't make sense when you think about it
In general slavic "gore" means up or heigh, so it makes sense it should be used for a mountain which is generally up
For whatever reason we saw that usually lots of forests are on mountains, so we started calling forests гори (plural)
But planina I have no idea where it came from
Sounds a little like the English word "plane" which just means the direct opposite of mountain
Similar, but not the same, Bulgarian такова (standalone it can be something like "like that")
It can be any par of the sentence and almost any part if speech
Most of the Khans and the Tsars
Basic stuff like:
* Asparuh - the Khan that founded Bulgaria
* Tervel - the Khan that saved Byzantium from the Arabs
* Krum - the Khan that made a drinking cup out of the Byzantine Emperor's head
* Boris - who converted Bulgaria to Christianity
* Simeon the Great - who commissioned the Cyrillic alphabet and almost captured Constantinople
* Vladimir Rasate - who tried to stop the Christianisation and Boris (his father) blinded him for it
* Samuil - the Tsar that died of a heart attack when he saw his 10000 soldiers returning from war blinded by the Byzantine Emperor Basil II Bulgarochtonos
* Boris III - who refused to extradite the Jews during World War II and most likely Hitler poisoned him for it
I've given four historical figures from three separate "eras" of Bulgarian history: Revival (before liberation); first Bulgarian kingdom/empire; modern Bulgarian state
I haven't included the second Bulgarian kingdom or anyone who participated in the many liberation movements and many of the people listed below can be switched with other equally known people
Vasil Levski,
Hristo Botev,
Goce Delchev,
Ivan Vazov,
Han Asparuh,
Han Krum,
Tsar Boris I,
Tsar Simeon the great
Tsar Ferdinand I,
Tsar Boris III,
Stefan Stambolov,
Todor Zhivkov
Also Vasil Levski, Hristo Botev, Georgi Rakovski, all of them were revolutionaries and Ivan Vazov, who is the most famous bulgarian writer
300+ wars with Byzantium and 4 with Greece since 681
I've read about multiple such cases in our Black Sea resorts, particularly Sunny Beach
Really sad but, after all, being so drunk is a choice
Definitely a thing in Bulgaria - well known cheap booze destination
I don't really like it tbh
We have a saying in Bulgaria "soup with grapes" meaning it's a bunch of different things that don't really work together and I think it applies to English
It's a Germanic language, where half the words are from Romance languages
I prefer Bulgarian because it isn't "soup with grapes" and I think this mainly comes from the fact that it has been perfected and revised for a lot longer than English
Bulgaria is experiencing it's second wave right now, we reached 10 000 cases (4689 active 5585 recovered) and 347 dead on Monday so people are kinda worried
The Ministry of Education said they are prepared to continue virtual schooling as long as possible but are operating under the assumption that schools will open up on 15th Sep as usual
The kindergartens were opened at the end of May, so parents have mixed feelings about the whole situation - at one hand, opening the kindergartens went well, on other hand - schools have less control over students than kindergartens over toddlers
I'm laughing so hard at this right now omg
Least problematic neighbors, better at fighting corruption than we are
Older stereotypes of course boil down to "hahaha, you have more gypsies than we do".
The simplest explanation is ignorant people, basically
The PC term for gypsies is Roma,so you can see where the misunderstanding may come from
Another reason is,when for example a pack of 300 gypsies moves to a German/English/French town to abuse welfare after which you get the local medias writing articles about that
The article will say "Bulgarians/Romanians doing X or Y"  and show pictures of gypsies and so that's where the association comes from
I don't blame the medias too much honestly,they are Bulgarian/Romanian citizens so I get why they're reporting it just like that,but imho people should know that they're **not ethnic Bulgarians/Romanians**. They live in a parallel society to ours and the only thing we share in common is the country
Count us in on that,Bromania
With so many young people migrating west, if that isn't true, it soon will be
Well, it's not in the same country for hundreds of years, it's in the same lands
And even though they don't have their own country,the stark ethnic differences between the gypsies and the ethnicity of the country they reside can't be glossed over
In Bulgarian it's чук (chuk) , I think its a somewhat hard quick word
Млатя (mlatya) means “to beat down” in Bulgarian
Wow  , chukan here it's a verb,  like "hammered " "knocked " , it could be "fucked " as well , depends on the context
I'm my country you'd be switching people without a job with people without a job so not much would change really
I had an italian friend and ever since I ate pasta at her house I can't eat it any other way
Most people here like it mushy though
Spelling bees are pointless in Bulgaria
Our language is like 97% phonetic and with the Cyrillic being created for it, makes differences between spelling and pronunciation rare
Since we write what we hear, when I was a kid and watched movies about spelling bees I was always baffled, because the idea is absurd for my own language experience
Spelling Bee finalist here
I was in 7th grade (13 y/o) when I decided to go to the spelling bee in my school
It was something not many people talked about and I wasn't that excited to go, but my english teacher basically told me "You're the best in your class/year, so you gotta". I won 2nd place, which means I went to regionals with the 1st place girl
A few months after we go to the regionals and it's comprised of two separate categories - the people who won first place go together and then the people who won second
The rounds were just spell a word from the list you've been given a few months prior
So one thing led to another and I won in my category (the girl from my school didn't win), so I was basically going alone to nationals
What I didn't know prior was that every national contestant is to go to a summer camp with volunteers, where we will basically have fun for free
(There were activities like baseball, baking, talent show, treasure hunt, etc)
During nationals there were three rounds - 1st round is spelling a word from the list, 2nd round is the judges giving you a word in bulgarian from the list and you need to translate and spell the word in english, 3rd round is unknown words from a separate list you don't receive
I have very fond memories of Spelling Bee, but it wasn't because of the competition, I just made a friend that is still one of my closest friends to this day (we went to high school together)
Apart from that, I was happy I did it because I got to be a mentee judge in high school and it was a really cool experience
Also we went to Hilton for free and my teacher still greets my dad on the street because of that
This is true if you speak Bulgarian "correctly". If you speak with a thick dialect and for some reason haven't listened to standard Bulgarian much, maybe it will be harder
Somewhat true
But as long as you attend school and watch TV, you'll be exposed to proper Bulgarian
We vote for parties and each party gets a proportial number of seats in parliament
However, Bulgarians mostly identify parties by their leader so it's not too different from a direct vote for a leader
And our parties are strongly hierarchical, so our PM can directly take control of any decision even when he doesn't have the jurisdiction to
No one even bats an eye
Our parents/grandparents badger us constantly about it, but realistically they know that things happen slower than they did in their time
My dad had 2 kids and his own home by 22, that's unfathomable to me from an economic standpoint, even now in my 30s.
Hey isn't it true that old Bulgarians live in Banat
Nazis
In Germany
Still
should the rest of us be worried
Solar highways, sacre blu what a stupid project that was xD
Interesting
It's just what it is: on Friday night you and friends get in the car and three hours later you're on the Greek shore, eating dinner in Thessaloniki
Sugar
Why
Surely sugar can't cost *that* much
In the US, a garbage disposal “In-Sink-Erator” is super common
Basically a motor connected to rotating blades down your sink drain that allows you to put food waste down the sink instead of putting it in the trash where it may start to smell
Maybe you see so few of these in Europe because of the different plumbing
In Bulgaria, many homes are still heated by a Petchka, wood burning stove
This is for oven cooking, has a few hobs on top and can also heat the entire house by heating water which is circulated to radiators using a pump
In my city we can't have a metro because every time they start digging they find something considered heritage and can't keep going
Even though we had mass protests this summer nothing will probably change in the upcoming election schedualed for march 2021, since if not for the ruling party the socialist(previous communist) party will be in control, something a lot of people don't trust
We have the same tradition called “koleduvane” so it’s likely a remnant of a pre-christian era
Sadly, today it’s pretty much dead in the cities and only lives on in some villages
I remember being a kid ~20 years ago and “koledari” coming to our village house and singing on Christmas eve
Fun fact, in Bulgaria we even call Christmas “Koleda”.
That’s easy
[Moya strana, moya Balgaria] by Emil Dimitrov (My land, my Bulgaria) is definitely like an unofficial anthem to Bulgaria
Everyone knows it, everyone gets patriotic and emotional whenever it plays
And even though it came out during the Communist years, when immigration was not really a thing, the lyrics talk about Bulgaria through the point of view of someone coming back - quite the heart-wrenching topic considering Bulgaria is the fastest shrinking country in the world and 30% of Bulgarians live abroad
The only other non-folklore song I can think of that may come close to that is [Edna balgarska roza] by Pasha Hristova (A Bulgarian rose)
The rose is the national symbol
As far as folklore songs go, those hold a special place in our popular culture and are the true mark of Bulgarian patriotism (to the point of stupidity, sometimes)
The most iconic one I can think of is [Koy ushi bayryaka] (Who sewed the flag)
The lyrics talk about [Rayna Knyaginya] an almost mythological figure from the late 19th century, a revolutional who sewed the flag that says “Liberty or death” for the April Uprising
We literally have a town called Златоград, or zlatograd which means "golden city". It's located in Bulgaria so I'll leave it up to you to guess whether there's any gold or wealth there
Sofia (our capital) is Greek for "wisdom", and given this is the place where our politicians reside I find this the last place I would attribute any descriptor for intelligence
Isnt the Royal form of Mann
As in just meaning "people"? If I'm not mistaken in old germanic both women and men were a form of man
For weoman remained women and whatever men had as a prefix was removed
Still can be seen well in the English language as in the mainland germanic languages you now have "frau or vrouw" for women
Maybe describes the population
Indeed
The devil lives in the Vatican
>The European Union is full of American military bases
The US has around 60 000 military personnel in Europe and there have been numerous proposals to decrease that number or remove all of them
>previous American leaders have always been very pro-European
You can't rely on the whims of the American public during their latest election to always be in Europe's best interest
That's madness
>The import tax rate is only 2
5% outside the EU, i.e. bread crumbs
All important taxes/tariffs have an effect, no matter how small
>The EU protecting is a joke and the Americans and the Chinese laugh when they hear that a strong EU will protect European markets
Yes, because the EU doesn't have the power to stop them unless the member states agree, and they won't when China and the US can bribe them individually
The only reason we're even in this mess is because people like you have been fighting against any integration and measures to increase the EU's power for years and now complain it's ineffective
The hypocrisy is just bewildering
July Morning
It started as a hippie thing opposing the socialist regime in the 60’s/70’s but it became widespread and is a very popular tradition to this day
On the night of 30 June, people gather at beaches (although those who don’t want to travel to the seaside go to the mountains, hills etc) and start bonfires, set up camps, party and sometimes famous people have concerts
At the end people watch the sun rise
It’s a very cool tradition
More info here:
Most foreign: either Kurdzhali (about 65% ethnic Turkish, right at the border with Greece) or Sofia (the richest, most western and progresive)
Most normal/ typical - any town in and around the Balkan mountains (Kazanlak, Koprivshtica, Gabrovo, etc
I must say, Sofia
I come from the seaside and I feel like the city is terribly mismanaged
Also no sea
Everything is written the way it's pronounced
That's a plus
We are the fastest dying population and nobody speaks our language
Big minus
For: it's Slavic and phonetic, meaning it will be easier to pick up for many countries
Against: it's never really spoken by the official standards, outside of the news on TV
Grammar is optional most of the time
Jokes on you our alphabet was based on yours ez pz lmn sqz
Also you can randomly rearrange the words in most sentences without losing any meaning
That's another minus
Grammar is rarely important
>You need a rational langage, so all southerns one are out
The fuck does that mean your language makes no sense
Roma Invicta
Our entire language has Greek origins so yano
Wait you can
Ayyy, you'll be able to join the club of 5 people and a cow
I don't know about grammar being easy
With being Bulgarian becoming rarer and rarer, you'll enjoy those perks even more as time goes on
Yes but you'd do it angrily
It's okay, English with a German accent is also very sexy
Че може, аз не знаех.
They said without problematic history
Честно казано то тва и в английския работи пък и не виждам как е минус.
"That you can do that, I did not know"
Idk I haven't heard anything about Czech being hard or Bulgarian being easy
The only impression I have of Czech is that it makes women sound very sexy, but that might just be because of the context I've heard it in
Tell me about it
I didn't want a slavic accent so I learnt English from my babysitter at the time (foreigner, native speaker) only to realise, wait, slavic accents sound kinda scary, I wanna be scary
Sad gamer hours
Mention North Macedonia and she'll get scary, trust me
Getting greedy for land after the first balkan war and thinking we can take on all our neighbours
We lost everything in the second balkan war because of it
As (to my knowledge) it isn't finalised yet, what do you think the reprecussions are going to be
I don't know man, given serbias history with their neighbours I'm not sure they should talk about backstabbing
But I will agree that we were greedy and should have put diplomacy above some useless lands and quick profit
Yep, same here
First mention of the Bulgars is somewhere in the 430s. There's like 50 theories on the stuff before that
The Thracian link is also pretty hazy in places
[Chelsea] logo always looks noble to me
Officially, as we like to call Ruse "the little Vienna", it should be Johann Strauss' Vienna Waltz
Unofficially, it would be some classic chalga song like the infamous "A white Mercedes chases me in life". It can be heard often enough on our streets, so it's already something of a backing track here
We have the friendliest angry people of Europe
I think we could be useful militarily
Today i read about it and how it probably derives from when we were enslaved
It was something about the idea of confusing the Turks so that they won't know when we say yes and when no
I have never actually been inside the Boyana church
But have you been to SFRJ Club Vienna
Granted that it's not the same thing but I've been to Belgrade a few times and I've never been to New Belgrade
Maybe once but it's like we just crossed a bridge said "yay we are out of the Balkans" and went to the old part of Belgrade again
Education, it will be almost impossible for you NOT to get a job, but you'll have to find a private school to teach at if you actually want money
All but "too much rice" and "half-dose" are usual in Bulgaria
Also a bit of garlic with the onion for rice
Never been in Bulgaria
Inside smoking has been banned for years and yet at least half of the places will allow it
In Bulgarian, if you are asked an obvious question you can answer by doubling the opposite of the answer, usually with some interjection
'Eh, Yes - yes' means 'No, obviously' and 'Eh, No - no' means 'Yes, obviously' (I am not sure about what punctuation to put between the doubling, but is is definitely not a comma)
Nobody mentions Bulgaria
Look at OPs question again
Who thinks Turkey is innocent
I mean our king was German so it makes sense to be fair
Plus we refused them soldiers for attacking Russia and we refused them any of our Jews
Plus they promised us our lands back so it makes sense we couldn't really complain about Germans taking the Jews from those lands
No, as far as I know we don't have autonomous regions
No - by Constitution we are a unitary state and autonomous regions within Bulgaria are impossible
Prolly [Alexander Nevsky Cathedral] for Bulgaria
I would have said [Alexander Nevsky Cathedral]
or that bridge with the dragons
e: shit that's not a building
I was in Chernobyl last August, one of the best moments of my life
Radiation levels are ''OK'' at most of the places in Pripyat, except near the Hospital or the Red forest
The guide told us not to step on moss as the moss contains the most radiation
Chernobyl itself (the villiage) was super chill compared to Pripyat, we even had an ice cream in the local babushka store
Birmingham, although it's not a tourist place at all but it's a very industrial city that I'd rather not visit again
Brussels, Skopje and Bucharest are also up there - sorry, my fellow neighbors
Outside of Europe I'd say Los Angeles disappointed me the most
For me it was Brussels
I really didn't like it
But I'm willing to try it again one day
I can't really judge it on just one day
Yes, I was visiting some friends
The one and only reason I went there
Way too much traffic and public transport is almost non-existent
I had to either walk a lot or spend a lot of money on Uber to get around
I've done that a few times (in different bars) and there was no reaction, the barman was just " here you go boys, have fun" . So , I don't think there will be a different  reaction than this .
Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Persia, Greece, Rome
That's about it
And of course Thracians
Here History is just one subject (aka we don't have World History), so it's pretty hard to cover a lot of cultures
The few we do are covered pretty deeply, though
When I was in school, we studied Ancient Cultures in 7th grade
During the first semester we studied the civilisations from Mesopotamia (so Sumer, Akkadia, Babylonia, Assyria, Hittite, Phonecians) and Ancient Egypt
During the second semester we studied Ancient Thrace/Dacia, Ancient Greece (or well, the Minoans, Ionians, then followed by the various Greek city-states such as Sparta or Athena), Macedonia under Alexander the Okay and its fall, and Ancient Rome and its fall
We also had talked about the Persians but I don't remember when we studied them
It might have been one lesson, or mostly in relation to the Greco-Persian wars or Alexander the Fine Lad conquering them
We learnt a bit about the tribes that ransacked Rome but less about their history and more about the ransacking
So although we say, studied the Huns, it was mostly in relation to Rome
Outside of the "the Bulgars were the Huns" theory
In 9th grade we continued with Medieval history, and that was very Europe centric, ignoring the Ottoman Empire
Otherwise, in Geography we studied different religions
I remember making a project on Shintoism when we studied Asia
But granted, it's only for modern surviving cultures
(And is probably a disservice to countries like China that was influenced by Taoism, Buddhism and Confucianism)
And even then, Ancient Mesopotamian, Egyptian, Greek and Roman religions were studied much more in comparison
I'm going to be terribly clever and say that H in Cyrillic is a normal N [n] sound
Press your tongue to the roof of your mount and make a (slightly nasal) sound
I was hoping to be the first Cyrillic-bro to answer and confuse them, but you beat me
Bit more disclaimer for Latin-based speakers - in Cyrillic we use same-written "H" character for our ["En" letter] not like you for [/ˈeɪtʃ/] .  Also our equivalent h/ch/kh sound is for the [Х letter] (which amusingly is again used differently from Latin, because Cyrillic [originates from Greek script mostly]
I would visit them all
I'm curious, which are those countries that you feel would instigate an international scandal because a low-level employee wanted a bribe
Ehm, no
EU citizens travel freely without a visa to all countries in green on this map:
This map states that all the countries in green do not require a visa for EU citizens
The UK is lumped with the EU and EFTA, because until the 31
2020, free movement of people between those three still exists
Depending on the outcome of the deal, the EU may lose its free movement priviliges with the UK (and vice versa), therefore some kind of a visa would be required for EU citizens to go into the UK
That means there will be a difference between how EU citizens visit the UK and how they visit the countries in green
I shared the map because you said that surely visiting the UK in the future will be the same as visiting the non-EU countries and it would just require a visitor visa
It won't be the same, as non-EU countries currently don't require any kind of visa
We have a couple of very colourful expressions
We say in it's mother's (or ant) pussy or in geography's ass
In Bulgaria, specifically plovdiv, we say "на майната" (na mainata) which probably has some weird etymology
It means something like go to fuck yourself but it's used to refer to some distant place where one has no business
We say "at its mother's pussy"
Bjørk
I honestly don't know
Some years ago there was this case where a guy opened fire on another guy
The shooter claimed self-defence but he was convicted for attempt at murder regarless
The general rule is you need to respeond with the same level of aggression, which is insane
So, supposedly, if you're attacked with a knife and you shoot, you're not self-defending
Although - very few people have guns here anyway
Such a personal union has certainly been proposed before, although I'm not sure if it ever happened
The only good monarchs are dead monarchs
My home town Dolna Banya (Down/Bottom Bathroom ) have 5 mineral water springs,  one of which was used in the roman bathhouse , after which the town is named
I don't know for my current city, but the name of the city I where I was born and raised translates to loud/noisy
Not even some old forgotten word that means that, it's our modern day word for it
Lower Bathhouse would be a better translation
They go мър-мър, verb: мъркам (мър - muh-R, like the u in umbrella)
As far as I know one of the conditions of getting into the EU is that the country HAS to adopt the euro at a certain point (that point being fulfilling five(?) major rules)
But before that it would be a catastrophy for the country's economy
Some countries deliberately don't fulfil some of the requirement in order not to adopt the euro (Sweden)
The only state I know of getting around this rule even though they are eligible for the currency is Denmark
EDIT: TIL UK as well (thanks kind strangers), however Danish kroner are pegged to the Euro via ERM II
Switching to the euro now would annihilate the entire Bulgarian economy
It would be a catastrophe
Bulgaria doesn't have any dumplings
Can't think of anything like that in our cuisine
I don't think we have anything close to dumplings
Closest I can think of is banitsa, but it's more like a dish, than small serving portions
You use doughy sheets (like with baklava) and wrap a mixture of cheese, milk and eggs
EU one, thank you
Never heard of it, I don’t think there is a Bulgarian version
Edit: found one, but it’s definitely a recent forced translation of the English one
It’s definitely not part of the classic children’s songs here
Same objects, but different order: Rock, Scissors, Paper
Not all of Southern Europe has low unemployment
Bulgaria has had a 4-6% unemployment rate in the last 20 years or so and it's because we have a semi-decent mixed economy and we've stayed away from full on Keynesean madness, unlike Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece who all just loved to borrow and borrow
With the above I am simply answering the question
Of course our living standards are below all the other mentioned southern countries and of course we have a lot of "working poor" people who can barely afford food & rent despite spending 40 hours per week at a job
Things are improving, though, and people are rising to the middle class as of late so let's see for how long we'll be lagging behind still
No Soviet-Bloc country was ever independent
I said Soviet-Bloc, Yugoslavia was not a part of that
If they get citizenship
It's really not that hard in Bulgaria
Depends if they intend to stay for the time the elected officials are in office
I'd say i can easily communicate with Macedonians, Serbs, Croats and maybe Ukrainians (if we really try)
I'd manage in romance language countries (not you though France) if they speak very slowly
Slavic countries would be more or less easy to manage (not you though Poland)
You'll manage in Bulgaria as well
You'd manage more or less with Russians as well
How does a Dutch guy learn Bulgarian
Bulgarian gf or something
That's interesting, because I'm a Bulgarian, I speak Italian and I passed a Spanish test having never studied Spanish in my whole life
It said I should bypass levels A1-A2 and should begin a course for B1
I've never been to Spain, never spoken/read/heard Spanish and I've seen Spanish only on TV for like a bit, a couple of phrases or something like that
For an outside learner it is really close to Italian, trust me
The nuances native speakers can see in the languages are something non-native speakers can't see until much later on
When I did my Erasmus in Milano, the only people in the advanced course for Italian, outside of people who had studied it before, were Spanish students
They went to the language test and it placed them in the C1 course immediately
They struggled more than the others, of course, but they definitely caught up way faster than is normal
Ah that's nice man
It's a nice country for vacations
Especially with that fat Dutch money :P

Tell me some about the Bulgarians :P
I thought Germans don't make jokes ;)
21-22C - Thermostat is set at 22C, but don't think it's uniform around the whole room
I usually keep it around 20-ish during the day, because sun makes me feel warmer, even though it's still around 20C inside actually
16-17C and lower is a cold room for me
If it's 18C I'm still pretty much ok (I am a hot-blooded guy though), just put on a thin fleece jacket or something
But lower than that I just can't keep my hands and feet warm (which is funny because I'm usually ok at 13-14-15 outside, as movement keeps me warm there)
This thread reminds me I should buy a room thermometer
Anyway since I don't feel cold or hot it must be between 23 and 27°C. That's my most comfortable range
My dad, however prefers 17-21°. I don't understand it
If they joined, they'd get voting rights on the rules they have to follow anyway
If they stay out, they don't have to participate in the common fisheries policy
The Norwegians decided that the strength of their fishing industry is more important than having voting rights, so they stay out
Once/if this ever changes, they should'nt have too many troubles getting in
If norway ever stops doing well without the EU, it's always welcome to join in my opinion
Until then I see them as friends and European brethren
That's what's so odd about brexit, they not only want to leave the EU but also make it sound as if they don't want to be a part of the continent in cultural terms
Wow, is that really the entire country of norway
About a third of your population does want to get in
As for what the point is, I've just stated it, voting rights on the rules you have to follow
Kindly refrain from twisting 'the cons outweigh to pros' into 'there are no pros', cheers
Even if you were dirt poor and the EU was doing fine
Lol yeah right
Thx Mr president of Norway
It's slowly getting better
In an ever steady incline since we were robbed blind by our own politicians during the change
The slope of the incline is so low because our politicians are still corrupt as hell
Oh well
As a young man, I've got no problem walking around most of my city alone at night (with the exception of certain neighbourhoods, going through which even in brought daylight is considered a bit adventurous)
Of course, my female friends have it a bit tougher
Most of them would only go out past dark if another person is accompanying them, preferably a man, but certainly not alone
In 2016 we made a survey with some 6000 respondents about night life in Sofia
The most popular reason to be worried about your safety reported were: being dark and tripping over something you didn’t see and homeless dogs
So, I imagine most people feel safe here, which is nice
The authors Bulgaria would consider its most significant like Hristo Botev and Ivan Vazov have at this point been dead for so long that their work is most likely in the Public domain
I could be wrong though
The word към in Bulgarian means towards and it is pronounced just like the English 'cum'. Also той (pronounced 'toy') means he
That
doesn't work very well when you have a different alphabet
Just respect the local culture
For example, if visiting a monastery in Greece, don't wear shorts or take one of the cloaks they offer
I've actually had positive experiences with Americans and there was only one case of a very annoying guy, who, after the landing of the plane, stated screaming "Hallelujah" and "Thank the Almighty God" and then wanted that everybody sing with him some sort of gospel song
Well, nobody was particularly fond of him and he was disappointed, because in the US he would have been (supposedly) applauded for this talent
Just don't do those kind of things
Stay away from the cycling lanes, if you go *anywhere in Europe*  (unless you are riding a bike)
We're still trying to teach these magic powers to some of the locals here, no need for tourists to join in
Tarator = Bulgarian summer soup
&#x200B;
Tzatziki = Greek salad
I'm Dutch in Bulgaria and it was really bizarre for me to get used to this Bulgarian thing where people are almost fighting each other to be the most noble person
It's ridiculous
Some have it worse than others, but I've seen it almost devolve beyond yelling at each other in public
So you go out together, have a drink and a meal in a restaurant and then when the time comes to pay the bill you'd better brace yourself because blood will be drawn before someone let's you pay
It's kind of annoying because it becomes a whole thing to do something nice for someone there
I think they're just very proud people or something
It's funny because I as a Dutch guy don't care who pays, I'm used to splitting the bill anyways
I did get into trouble with a friend once over this passiveness of mine
We went out to a amusement park and this friend of mine told me I should pay the tickets because this other friend of mine wasn't that rich
I had paid a bunch of stuff for all of us before that so I assumed my "debt" had been sufficiently paid
Regardless, we arrive at the entrance and I walked up to pay
However that poor friend sped up and reached the desk before me and already had money on his hands and already ordered the tickets
I was like lol OK
Turns out, and I actually got into a fight over this, I should have somehow forced myself in front of him and taken the money out of the cashiers hands and replaced it with my own money, and then argued about it with him in public like a bunch of lunatics
This was a big thing for me to get used to in Bulgaria
I was visiting my girlfriend's family in Malta for the first time last year, and I was surprised to see people living in houses keeping the front door opened
at all times, even during the evening
Oh, and they are extremely religious, especially the older generations
Oh and to add to Dutch/Bulgarian differences, I'm having difficulty matching the eating speed of Bulgarians
They eat really slow in the evenings and will stay at restaurants until past midnight eating cold food
I try to match it but I'm always too hungry, so I will usually have finished my meal a long time ago
To be fair I like the Bulgarian way of dinner far better than the soulless "eat and get out" style of the Dutch
OMG yes,you made my day, thank you
> Not using clacson
This is the first time I see this word used in English
I swear it's so fucking weird seeing it like this
Which stereotype about Europe do you hate
That Europe = Britain
I like how you didn't even mebtion the whole of the Netherlands, just Amsterdam
Painfully accurate though
Everyone being rich, cultured/rude, racist and probably more I've heard
Interesting
I've always heard it the other way around
Bulgarians are considered gypsies too sometimes, I get you
You know corruscant from star wars

I live in Ruse, my country's 5th largest city
Here in Sofia
- A large 150sqm flat in the most expensive areas - [example]
- A 403sqm house in the suburbs - [example]
- Four one-bedrooms (~70sqm) in an average area - [example]
- Six one-bedrooms (~70sqm) in a poor area - [example]
It's really confusing
We have it both ways, haha
The floor above the ground floor if the building has stores on the ground floor, otherwise - the very first floor above the ground
Houses follow the same rule
Same here
The ground floor is ,,партер" (parter) and then the one above is ,,Първи етаж" (1st etage - pronounced as in french)
Let's see
Bulgaria invented the Cyrillic alphabet used in a big part of the world
We're also proud that the inventor of the first digital computer is John Atanassov, with Bulgarian descend
Also the airbags in the cars (which saved a lot of lives) and the first aerial bombardment
which didn't save a lot of lives
The first digital electronic computer
The oral contraceptive pill
The cyrillic alphabet
Contributions for the creation of one of the first digital wristwatches
Yoghurt (not the Greek variation, although similar)
No, Santa lives in Lappland which is a region located within three countries(if I am not mistaken) - Finland, Sweden and a small part in Norway
In Bulgaria people put mustard/ketchup/mayo all over their pizza before eating
Dipping garlic sauce does not really exist, or if we do, we put it on the top of the pizza
Pro: really cheap
Both living and property
If you're a EU retiree, you can live like a king here just from your pension alone
Con: language barrier, low standard of living outside of big cities
Cons: low standard of living, bad government,the peoples are toxic af
Pros: I cant remember any pros in living in Bulgaria nowadays
We had beautiful nature but we are destroying it fast, We had great education but we dont have it anymore .But at least we have 1300 years of history at least so we can remember about the lost Bulgaria
Pros: Beautiful nature
Cons: Very incompetent politicians, Corruption, Extremely low wages, high taxes, a lot of iliterate people who can be very aggressive, Not a lot of historical places and such(because during our 500 year long ottoman rule we were slaughtered our houses burned etc
) Very very polluten
Conclusion: The country is in a serious crysis right now
Sorry for bad english also
Pros: Nice weather, amazing nature, nice beaches, rich culture and nice food
Cons: Low wages, corruption and the streets are awful
Not to mention the pollution in some of the bigger cities
Most of the problems will disappear if our politicians disappear
They really are
Sofia's GDP per capita PPP is already on par with France
The same stat for small cities is on par with Namibia
The villages are even worse
The Romanian national anthem
There is even a fantastic [Lebanese] version of it
It's a great song
Bulgaria isn't transcontinental, we are pure mongol
I watched documentary film about this
Rose jam
Sure, smells nice (to some, for me it's like eating soap) and if you like it then maybe you have a forgotten jar at the back of your cupboards
But there are so many great jams out there so why buy the more expensive novelty one
Not to mention a lot of people make their own and good luck with tryna make a rose jam
And most importantly, even if you wanted to have it a lot - you can't! Eat too much and it will give you the shits
If you're eating something sweet and you dont share it with someone who wants some
Their dick falls off
What folders
Just toss that shit into the backpack and search for it the first 15 minutes of each class
Holy fuck, that's beyond creepy, extreme only begins to describe it
How is this possible in the capital of country in the heart of EU
Is there no police there
Some dodgy neighborhood
Don't want to trigger people, but curiosity begs - what kind of people are we talking about - recent immigrants
I can't imagine anyone else being so out-of-touch with societal norms and culture, but I haven't been in France so I might be missing something
Here its dark in 17:40 ~ 17:50 and we are almost on the frikin Mediterranean
So, sadly, seems part of the culture in some circles there
Weird, I've been to other big capitals, always seemed enough police in central zones (probably due to counter-terrorism) to deter any bullshit
I'm keeping notes for a potential vacation :P
For us as a region the Rhodopes, for the city I'd say plovdiv

In my country (Bulgaria) they sell good things with good quality, and it looks like they are going not for the big countries but for the medium type of countries,  that don't have very good economy and at the same time they don't have the worst
Lidl has different strategies for east and west
In Bulgaria they have huge nice good quality stores whereas in the Netherlands they actually are small and they are marketing to poor people or people on a budget
A mixture of ало or да.
If I’m tired I may accidentally answer the phone like that in English also
There’s a certain portion of Bulgarian society that may answer with кой, which is who
I’d say it feels closer to answering the phone by saying what
If that happens it usually a sign you’re in for a more amusing and or frustrating call
It’s well fairly rude and unprofessional though I’ve heard it used by a government service before
It was founded for the first time in 681
So if you don't count the two centuries it was part of the Roman Empire and the five centuries it was part of the Ottoman Empire, Bulgaria has existed for 1339 years
>part of the Roman Empire
Uhm
You mean the Byzantine empire
Byzantine Empire = Eastern Roman Empire
Delivery or if in Sofia (the capital), you can take one of the cargo Sparks - [electric trucks] for rent
There are also hamali (movers) - firms, specialised in moving heavy stuff
They employ young guys, they come with their own truck, they carry your stuff, load it, move it and unload it
Nobody uses drywall, but I get the question
You fold down the backseats and see if it fits if it doesn't you drive with you boot open
How you may ask, we'll get some straps and tie everything down as much as you can to try and keep it in your car
Yes, we cooked an egg omelet once
Like many of the people who comment I'd say that speaking the language should be a requirement for citizenship
Not because I think that my national language is the best in word or our of some nationalist sentiments
No, it is because if you want to be a citizen, this carries some rights and obligations
And to be a fullfledged member of the society you need to speak the language on a decent level
Administrative work, voting, and being able to familiarise yourself with and obeying the laws are some serious points in my book
And in my country, you won't have an easy time if you do not speak Bulgarian
Your book
I'm gonna need a name :)
That's a figure of speech
I haven't really written a book
Ooh
Hever heard it before but hey learnt something new
:D Almost thought someone had actually written a book about migration in Bulgaria
Haha, sounds too good to be true
10 min walk + 15 min by tram or about 20 min by bike
A third option will be made available to me in May, when the third line of our metro opens, which will be 5 min walk + 10 min by metro
About 30 - 40 minutes by a nasty, smelly tram, or close to 1h 30 minutes by walk
Too cold for walks still :(
15 - 30 minutes by car in city traffic
Sometimes more or if I leave at 17 30
Don't put your hopes on the metro, so you'll be surprised if it actually opens on the new deadline
It will open *at some point*.
I know Dutch people who moved out in their early teens 16ish
I also know Dutch people who pay rent to their parents since their 14s. Meanwhile in Bulgaria 30 and still with your parents is relatively common

Fun fact: that Russian alphabet
We invented it
fun fact: it's true, read more ya greekz
It literally is though
100% fact
Not the current official Russian alphabet as it is now ofcourse but the general cyrillic alphabet was invented by the Bulgarian literary schools based on the preceding glagolitic alphabet invented by Cyril and Methodius and symbols commonly used in the Greek alphabet
Hey you're right in one thing
Cyril and methodius were from thessaloniki which was not Bulgarian at that time
However, they did not invent the cyrillic alphabet but the glagolitic alphabet
Don't worry, it's a common misconception
If you're saying the cyrillic alphabet was inspired by the glagolitic alphabet because that's the alphabet the Bulgarian literary schools were working with before, then yeah sure
Still makes it Bulgarian though otherwise the Greek or Latin alphabet doesn't exist either :P
Try the Rhodopes if you're into nature hiking and stuff, it's fantastic
Really depends on what kind of stuff you're into
You could check out the St George rotund Church if you're interested in your own Greek history
Otherwise there's vitosha if you're into hiking
Boulevard vitosha is great for shopping
If you're looking for alternatives to Sofia I'd advise veliko turnovo and plovdiv
I'd rather not tell you cause no matter what I say greeks and turks under my comment will argue whether Greeks or Turks made it even though I'm talking about the Bulgarian version
[Garash cake] and its walnut deliciousness
I am sorry but Lol
That Khan Krum destroyed all vineyards
The people who believe that also believe he used Emperor Nikephoros' skull as
wait for it
a drinking cup
I guess they think that he drank only lemonade from it, no alcohol whatsoever
Also that Saints Cyril and Methodius were Bulgarians who invented the Cyrillic alphabet
Neither of these things is true
Very common in Bulgarian towns and villages, less common in cities
Woohoo, we are pretty proud of our empire
But the thing is that it was one thousand years ago, so it's not a political matter in present times
But yeah, we're pretty proud
We also have a "meme" kinda phrase - "Bulgaria on three seas
" Sometimes to joke with the nationalists, sometimes like a nostalgia in a funny context
Even if not empire, Finland is awesome on so many levels
For us Finland is saunas and Simo
Fuck yeah
Hokkaido is my city
Possibly Volen Siderov - he's the leader of a far-right party (ATAKA) who's agenda is very hate-based, and his hobbies include getting into fights with university students
He's a fucking joke, as are most of the pathetic neo-nazis in his circle
They appeal mostly to nationalists, who often overlap with football hooligans
That whole thing is a can of worms but the guy is not taken seriously by a lot of people, even his mannerisms and general behaviour/speech is ridiculous
That being said, our Prime Minister Boyko Borisov isn't the most popular among people and his public image (as a man of the people, for lack of a better term) has mixed reception - mostly positive, perhaps, at least for the "uneducated masses". As for the people who are strongly opposed to him - he's a good focal point of a lot (dare say - all) of the corruption within our political and judicial system, but I can't call the people preaching for other politicians more educated - just *sick of his shit*. We hate all our politicians though
It's Delyan Peevski
In 2013, when he was announced to lead the "Bulgarian FBI", DANS, tens of thousands of people protested for months
He appoints the General Prosecutor by a fake vote from the High Judicial Council
He controls the prosecution and a large amount of the judges
He controls the Prime Minister Boyko Borissov, receiving millions of euros in official state and European funding programmes
He controls most of the media outlets in the country, one of which is the most watched television, Nova TV
Bulgaria is #111 in the Freedom of Speech index
Last in Europe
In 2013 the 4th biggest bank in the country was forcefully bankrupted by the state under his command, so that he wouldn't have to return his loans and he would be able to steal the bank's assets
The prosecution "couldn't find" a link between him and the bank
He is the face of the state mafia and the country is going straight to a shit hole because of it
Cheap labour and a place to have your company if you don't like a lot of taxes
Bulgarian communist party secretary intended to make Bulgaria the 16th republic of the Soviet Union, the plenum unanimously approved Todor Zhivkov's proposal
If that happened Bulgaria would have been the first country voluntarily joining to the USSR
So it think that the period 1944 - 1989 is full of such betrayals
Our judicial system says that the General Prosecutor of the country is to be elected for a seven-year period by high-standing judicial people like judges and e.t.c There was only one candidate and he is "morally flawed". He was "elected", but our president put a veto on his "election". They did another "election" and he was once again "elected". The democratic choice of the only candidate
There are protest now against that and people want a new procedure with more candidates
Used to be 30%,  more like 1
5% now but culture remains very heavily influenced
Before WWII the name was Министерство на войната (Ministerstvo na voynata) or "Ministry of War". After WWII, it was renamed to Министерство на отбраната (Ministerstvo na otbranata) or "Ministry of Defense".
I know that during monarchist times it was named "Ministry of War" however at some point between 1944 and now it's changed to "Ministry of Defence"
Let's hope so
I like liberal societies which protect their citizen's civil rights and freedoms
Also I prefer a president that looks like a business executive over a mafia hit man
I hate [Moussaka] and [Shkembe Chorba]
Тъмна Индия ми е. - "That's dark India to me
" - extremely foreign, unfamiliar
Развод по италиански. -"Divorce the italian way
" - signifies that the only break up in the situation is death of one party
Френска любов. - "French love
" - oral sex
Седя по турски. - "Sitting the turkish way
" - sitting on the floor in a lotus position
But by far the most popular are:
Лъжа като дърт циганин. - "To lie like an old gypsy
" To lie naturally, often and with no remorse
Оглеждам се като обран евреин. - "To look around like a robbed jew
" - to be standing around and looking around, optionally with suspicion, and not doing anything
And most Slavic languages refer to Germans as "nemtzi" and other variants of that
A literal translation could be "mute
" It comes from labelling their language as "gibberish" centuries ago, and it just stuck, transcending borders between us
> I don't think these negative comments are because of racism but bc of their behavior as a collective
Yeeees
Thank you for this
It's not some "white power,people with darker skin are inferior" thing
It's a "my only interactions and experiences with them were bad" thing
Also political correctness is not a thing here
You can't expect me to not speak my mind and act like everything is all roses and sparkles so that I don't upset someone
> And if that is the case, we should find a way that does not hurt people so everyone can enjoy the holiday
You can never appease anyone, unfortunately
It's a Dutch tradition and you guys are entitled to it,American SJW's be damned
I really don't like this trend of American political correctness being exported to Europe
I'm not advocating to be an asshole,but there should be a line to political correctness,often it's too much for my tastes
This one about [Bulgaria] is really well made , I've watched it a couple of times and everything in it is pretty accurate
Especially since it was the local Romanian and Bulgarian populace that was the subject
Good engineering
Have faith brother, it was the same in Bulgaria but people really started oppening up to Board Games in recent years
Still DnD and Warhammer are not that popular, but now you can at least explain the concept and people will start to understand you
I'm sure that its going to be the same for Croatia soon too
Same here
Eat so much fast food
I can only think of this [one]
I want the commission president to be elected directly
We learn about it in Bulgaria, but not in huge detail, of course
Maybe a page of the history book and 10 minutes of a lesson would be dedicated to it
Wait, did you not study Geography
We had to learn where every country in the world is, what its capital is and some basic facts, including climate and exports
Of course, most teachers in most schools don't bother making kids learn the countries and capitals in Africa or Oceania for example (Bulgaria is poor, our teachers are paid low wages), but in Europe
We needed to know everything important about every country
Yeah
If that's how it is in rich and powerful countries, no wonder a lot of people there think very highly of themselves
And considering it's a lot worse in the USA, I get now the millions of people parroting how their country is the only important one, the greatest in the world and so forth
> that French history is already so rich and complex that we just don’t have time to study the History of countries
This is EXTREMELY not true and if that's the case in France, you are in a bad need of education reform
Exactly
I've studied a lot about European countries - geography, history, culture, etc
, I've been to a lot of them, of course
And I feel close to these countries - when somebody says he's European I don't immediately think he's a foreigner, like I would for an American or a Japanese
My first thought is "he's like me, he's European".
Jesus
How is Bulgaria better than France in education
I my country wasn't in the Soviet Union, but it was in the Eastern Block
And I have never seen a real cockroach in my life
But I heard my parents talking about how many there were before
Considering not much ancient architecture survived, but modern one is either nice small scale, derivative middle or fugly-Communist big-scale, my best guesses are some of the old-but-not-ancient architecture examples:
[Rila Monastery]
Some of the old architecture reserve towns like:
Koprivshtitsa: [1] [2]
[Tryavna]
[Zheravna]
[Kovachevitsa]
Thus the birth of one of the funniest memes I have ever seen - the Chinese woman shouting "This is killing
" And the added picture of a goat underneath her (killing in Swedish means the child of a goat or something like that)
It's actually a joke I came across sometime ago, but also disturbingly true
You're not a Bulgarian if you don't have:
A plastic bag full of plastic bags
A 2l bottle of Coca Cola full of Rakia
An ice cream box  full of [sarmi] in the fridge
Well, when it raged, half of Europe was isolated behind the Iron curtain which limited travel and therefor slowed the spread there, but then again, once it got through the curtain, the lack of information and awareness made it spread faster
Bulgaria registered its first case in 1986 and up to this day we have 3173 cases
The authorities are allocating funds for prevention and control, the confirmed cases have access to antiretroviral therapy but still on last estimate 95% of the confirmed cases are on it
Wut, I didn't know that
I know there is a strong campaign in Bulgaria about prevention
But is this therapy free for thr inflected or they have to pay for it
Therapy is covered by the state
If you are a confirmed case, you are sent to a specialist and you are asigned checkup schedule, treatment plan etc
Your contacts are also given to foundations and social groups, dealing with HIV+ people, that provide psychological help to deal with the shock and fear
The National Refference Laboratory works with HIV/AIDS cases and each patient that goes there to be tested can talk to a psycologist on sight
Every haematology cabinet, gynecologist practice, GP and sexology practice has brouchures and information about it
I know all this because two years ago I went to have myself tested and the test came out possitive, so I went through hell for two months before the refference laboratory confirmed my negative status with the ELISA and the WB tests
So, yeah
get yourselves tested, people
Wtf
Why did it come out positive in the first place
And after that negative
Doesn't it make more sense the first tries not to detect it and after that to detect it when the virus has spread more
How can you detect something which is not physically there
I'm confused
The quick blood tests that most laboratories use are hypersensitive, so they often result in a "false positive". They are designed like this to make sure that they will catch even the slighest infections, but when they missfire on a negative person, they tend to scare them a lot
Ah, ok, that makes sense
Italian
I love Swedish
I get excited when I hear it every single time and I don't know why
Vad spännande
I don't care about insults about any country including my own
But if you make a wrong one get ready for a debate boyo lol
Not as many Russians as it used to be tbh
Though the number might be the same but many other nationalities started vacationing here so the Russians are not as noticeable
But yeah pretty much correct
We joke about Brexit you should not feel bad joking about our government lol
Well, first of all my father's name translated to "Wolf", so everyone, especially his coworkers, used to call me "the wolf cub". My parents also called me "bear cub" and later I was very impressed with some documentary about deer and I'd walk around roaring like a stag, so mom still calls me "stag".
Yess
That is not explainable but for some reason when I hear it makes sense
No idea how
Thankfully it didn't happen much but my dad sure called me "dad" a lot
Yea , exactly,  especially dad calls me "тате" (tate) all the time , mom , not so often but still calls me mom .
It comes from a possessive form, like "maminoto" (mommy's [kid])
I've heard almost every kind of relative call a kid affectionately by their own
degree of relation to them: mom, dad, aunt, uncle, grandma, grandpa, big sis
Big brothers have been an exception, strangely enough
Also can apply to pets
My aunt used to call her cat "mamo".
u/Acctforlnsub below says it's called inverse vocative
It originated as "mom's kid" or something
It didn't happen a lot that my mother called me "mom".
Idk, here "bate" or "batko" ("big bro") is used as "bro". Like, *puts on glasses* informal communication between two young to middle-aged males of similar social standing
Yeah, monsters go to Russia and get depressed
In Bulgarian, there are rules that determine the gender of the word
All words ending in -a are feminine, all ending in -o or -e are neuter and the rest are masculine
The only exception I  in the word for grandfather - дядо - it ends in -o but is treated as masculine
There's never confusion about the gender of a word for that reason, so we know what article to use
There's some confusion when it comes to 'the' - in Bulgarian, that is added to the end of a word
For masculine words, there are 4 different versions of the - 'a', 'ът/ut', 'я/ya' and 'ят/yat'. Which one you use depends on the role of the word in the sentence (if it's the subject, you use the versions ending in t) and of the word itself
People usually confuse when to use a subject 'the' and when to use a non-subject 'the', but it doesn't depend on if the word is new or not
Bulgarian is actually an exception as it's a Slavic language and we use articles as well but we have no case system, only remnants of it (there used to be one but it was abolished some time ago)
That's why I find it difficult to wrap my head around the concept of cases and even more so the absence of articles
One I hate: that we're all sly, stealing gypsies that go around Europe to basically cheat the system over and over again
No work ethic whatsoever
One I enjoy: that the women are gorgeous
I completely agree, in school I was in a class with 24 girls for 12 years of my life
Six of my classmates won beauty pageants
They were and still are absolutely beautiful
funny thing is, most people here see the backstabbing incident as you (Serbs) being greedy for territory during the first war, while we were the ones actually fighting the Turks, so a Bulgarian stereotype about Serbs is an imperialistic dream that never comes true
But that's just kinda how nationalism works
In Bulgaria, no doubt [Vasil Levski] is considered the greatest man, he was a revolutionary fighting against the Ottoman rule in the 19th century
But we have many heroes in our history:
[Hristo Botev] - also a revolutionary and great poet
[Georgi Rakovski] - same
[St
Paisiy Hilendarski] - the author of "History SlavicBulgarian", very important book for Bulgarians
[Ivan Vazov] - "the Patriarch of Bulgarian literature".
Also many Tzars and Khans from our history - [Tzar Simeon The Great] [Khan Asparuh] [Khan Krum] [Knyaz Boris I] [Tzar Kaloyan] and more
The list is very long of poets, writers, painters, clergymen, generals, prime ministers, many
many revolutionaries and so on
Vasil Levski - He had an important role for our liberation
(not sure how to add Bulgarian flag in my name so take note I'm talking about Bulgaria)
Vasil Levski: this is the main guy, during ottoman occupation we had all these ruffian "haiduks" that occasionally showed some resistance to the occupation, but this dude was an intellectual who united the intelligentsia of the country into committees
He was heavily influenced by the French revolution and the American revolutionary war and organised resistance in Bulgaria
He's the main hero because he had very social political ideas
Paisi hilendarski (paisius of the Hilendar monastery): so first take into account that Bulgaria was under Turkish occupation for 500 years
Even the most stubborn patriots start to become assimilated after such a long time of suppression
This guy went through all the ancient libraries of all the few Christian monasteries of Bulgaria to try and find some historic info on who the Bulgarians were
He had a pivotal role in reigniting the cultural identity of the Bulgarians by reacquainting them with their history
Hristo Botev: poet, teacher and revolutionary fighter
This dude is almost as famous as levski
He didn't start the whole organisation but he did organise the uprising effort from Romania with all the Bulgarians that had fled from Turkish law/violence
Khan Tervel: The king of the first Bulgarian empire, made peace with the roman empire and helped them defeat the arabs who were going up take Constantinople
If you think you're lucky that the French yeeted the arabs from Europe, you should definitely know about this guy
Khan Krum: defeated the romans and actually managed to kill the first roman emperor
Made a cup out of the dudes skull
He also made the first laws of the Bulgarians and won us thrace if I'm not mistaken
Tsar Boris: this guy got us Christianity, which some current Bulgarians are happy about, but he also got us the caesar title (that's where tsar comes from, Russia take note)
Kliment Ohridski (kliment from ohrid): you know that weird Russian alphabet
This dude invented it together with some colleagues
Due to shoddy edution most people think Cyril and Methodius made the cyrillic alphabet but they made the glagolitic alphabet
Don't know why but tsar simeon wanted another alphabet so the Preslav literary school made the cyrillic alphabet named in honour of their old teacher Cyril
The main known guy to have been part of this creation was Kliment
Tsar Simeon: this dude was one of the most successful tsars in our history
Its during this time we began heavily contributing culturally though a large bit of it is lost because the ottomans like destroying things
Kaloyan and the Asen brothers : these guys are famous for creating the second Bulgarian empire after we were taken over by the Romans
It took varangians, the Kiev Rus and the byzantine romans with the most legendary General they have ever had in their entire history to finally kick our assess
Nonetheless the Asen brothers created an uprising and we were free again
Then Kaloyan continued after them and defeated the Latin empire that had taken over constantinople
Polkovnik serafimov: Polkovnik is something like colonel and his last name was Serafimov
This dude is a hero because when we had the first balkan war this dude refused orders from above to abandon some villages in the Rhodopes knowing that the Turks have a bit of a sick history with what they do to innocent villagers and he fought against far greater numbers and still managed to win the battle and save these villages
X voivoda: I'm leaving the name blank but voivoda means leader of a haiduk group
This is a band of rebels or bandits
Technically they weren't always good guys but the really bad were eventually called kurdzhali and generally most celebrated haiduk voivods are the ones that never did anything bad
These are generally seen as resistance fighters or partizans who fought against Turkish occupation
The ones that actually did are the ones people actually mention whereas those that robbed and killed anyone are generally forgotten
In a way the haiduti are the pirates of the Bulgarians and the voivods the captains
I don't know about Italy, but in Bulgaria, Garibaldi is very respected, he inspired some of our own 19th century revolutionaries like [Georgi Rakovski] and [Captain Petko Voyvoda] One of the main squares in central Sofia is named after him and there are a few monuments in his memory
He's more of an anti-hero
Left out are: gotse delchev, ljuben karavelov, todor alexandrov, georgi benkovski, peyo yavorov, etc etc
It's all of them dying and the take over by the communists why we're currently so bad off
We have a whole cathedral named after him
I have great-grandparents that took part in both Balkan wars and the first World War (not sure about the Second)
Some of them were part of the [battle and capture of Odrin (Edirne)]
Interesting when Bulgaria was released from the  ottoman empire it was separated in to two parts one is the kingdom of Bulgaria and the other was East romelia so the Turks called us Romans for 20 years
Simeon I held the title "Emperor and Autocrat of all Bulgarians and Romans" and we used to claim that Tarnovo was the third Rome
So there's that
Whether we have is [up for interpretation] but personally I wouldn't say Bulgaria's claim to this is the worst one out there
Trajan's rule was remembered in these lands until the medieval period, and up until the 11th century (which is when we became a East Roman vassal for 100 years) our rulers actually claimed the title Emperor
The ones afterwards did too, to varying degrees of validity
I'd say we tried our best to cosplay as Rome
I see lots of polish people at my work and for me it sounds like I just had a stroke
Like  I SHOULD be able to understand it, it sounds almost like Russian
but for some reason I don't. Most of the other slavic languages are the opposite for me - they may be easier to understand but they sound very different
Taxis near the airports
I can see how this can make a scene but how can they force you to pay without beating you up
In which case .. why bother the theatre with the wallet and not straight up beat you
All the Dutch are so quiet
Come on, don't act as if your education isn't a shit show
It's really messed up, most teachers in public schools get less than 1000BGN (about 500EUR) a month, then there's the constant changes of how school works then there's the НВО after 7th grade which changes every year, 7th year itself is hell, and much, much more
This system sucks
A lot
No wonder people go to better countries later on in their life
Here it's almost the same but luckily no religion
Millions to religion
I'm really worried about Poland
Damn, most of this also applies here,too
That's criminal
That money could be used way better
Now it's just thrown in the trash and actively promotes the decrease in intelligence of your population
That's real bad
Goulash - the first thing I ate in Prague in a restaurant called "U Parlamentu" in Stare Mesto
That is the best thing I have eaten anywhere else abroad
Ever
Wait
Raw cucumber
How else do you eat cucumber
Do you cook it
I knew it
I tried it in Bulgaria years ag, cooked by a friend but didn't like it at all
So when I went to Czechia I ordered it out of interest and I really liked it
I have never EVER eaten cooked cucumber
We pickle cornichons here, but they are not the large cucumbers we call
[cucumbers]
The ragout
Most of the time i just say a random tongue twister to impress them
"No I will not" or just some random sentence for greeting someone
So, sorry mate, we just wanted our territories back as they were before the Ottoman empire
Also, who doesn't like to have another sea where to go sunbathing and chilling
Yeah, we did have a dispute with Turkey, too but not anymore
I think, at least for me it's FYROM - it's a very difficult talk and we are trying to build again a strong relationship but also I have been to the country and I saw and heard what are they thinking of us truly
It wasn't really pretty and I really can't understand the hate towards us
Не се сърди човече.

We have the same game, the name is "Don't be angry, man
I know Presov and Komarno
I learned that last one when I was flying aimlessly in Google Earth around the danube and I saw on the Wiki that Komarno and Komarom were one city but then after the dissolution of Austria-Hungary one part was left in Hungary and the other in (Czecho)Slovakia

That we are thieves
The communist apocaliptic poordom made it rather profitable
From corrupt Politicians (most communists stayed in power), Trough the gypsy minority that has whole self sugregated group of wallet thieves,
to the bulgarian (and romanian) cyber thieves that are constantly arrested for draining credit cards
Also **worst of all** there are the **Phone scammers** \- they call old people, using kids or teens and fake that fatal car accident had happened and unless they pay up, their grandchildren go to jail
So in moment of panic those people give away all their savings ! its heathbreaking story
The thieves oftenly use the money to build a lavish mansions, that oftenly end up burned to crisp by the relatives of those that had suffered
We are currently on our 4th Constitution:
* **Tarnovska Constitution** \- enacted in 1879, after Liberation it was the Constitution that defined Bulgaria as a constitutional monarchy, ruled by a Knyaz (after Independence - Tsar) and with a unicameral Parliament;
* **Dimitrov Constitution** \- enacted in 1947 and named after the National traitor and butcher Georgi Dimitrov, this Constitution defined Bulgaria as a "Pеople's Republic" with pseudo democracy;
* **Zhivkov Constitution** \- enacted in 1971 and named after the Communist dictator and a sock puppet come to life Todor Zhivkov it reorganised the country and established a single party system of which the Bulgarian Communist Party is the only legal legislative and executive organ;
* **The current Constitution** \- enacted in 1991, defining Bulgaria as a "Republic", declaring political pluralism, market-based economy and a ban on a party or entity ever declaring it's self above or indeed - the source of soverignity, which the Constitution defines as "the people";
* **GERB's Proposal for a New Constitution** \- after two months of anti-government protests and accusations that the current ruling government can't provide the change demanded by the street, the ruling GERB party and it's braindead leader Boyko Borisov, came up with the briliant idea to write a new Constitution
The Parliament won't be dissolved, you see - because the people want change, so this discredited Parliament and this discredited government will discuss the project for the new Constitution by the end of their term, so we have that one in the bag now too
According to the current Constitution, a Constitutional ammendment is allowed to be done by Parliament if 3/4 of all MPs approve the ammendment via the voting in of a Constitutional Ammendment Act
The sections of the Constitution that are in the prerogative of the Grand National Assembly cannot b changed by the regular Parliament
A new Constitution can only be written and enacted by the Grand National Assembly
A Grand National Assembly is like a temporary Senate - it holds 400, rather than 240 MPs, it can only be formed for the purpose to write a new Constitution, to change the territorial reach of Bulgaria, to declare wars etc
катерица / katerica
/'katɛrit͡sə/
Pretty easy to pronounce
Edit: As others said, it comes from the verb 'катеря' (katerja) meaning 'to climb'.
Катерица (Kateritsa)  from катеря   (climb)
Катерица (kah-teh-r-ee-tza), etymology suggests "creature (or object) that climbs".
Our entire language is impossible for foreigners but I feel like this word isn't even that bad
The ц fucks people up, and our Rs (р) are different than most (non-slavic) languages
I’ve never studied Russian but I’m pretty sure it is
The Bulgarian “ц” is like the English “ts”, German “z”, Czech/Serbo-Croatian “c” etc
Many
And the thing us that very often on international level our government would support some policy while domestically would execute exactly the opposite
I did, but few can afford it
I needed math for the university entrance exams for what I wanted to study, and the things we were taught in the private courses were both not taught in highschool, and 100% necessary to pass even with the minimum
The only public highschool that teaches math like that in my city is literally called a mathematics highschool
I guess it's another way to gatekeep against the poor and make it appear as if we live in a meritocracy, when it's not even approaching one
People don't try to fix the system if they believe it's already fair
Yeah
People use it for the bigger exams like for 7th grade (before entering a high school) and before entering an university or 12th grade
For 12th grade some people start to prepare 2-3 years before them, at least if you wanna go to medical university
Very prominent, though in certain years
You won't see elementary students going to private classes
There might be a few exceptions but it isn't common
A lot of people start going in middle school
Some start in 5th grade if their elementary school didn't prepare them well for middle school
Others start in 6th grade to prepare for the exams in 7th grade
The students that get good grades in school usually start to go in 7th grade
For me, going to Bulgarian classes was necessary (mostly because I had only been in Bulgaria for about 3-4 years back then) but math was unnecessary - our school teacher taught us more than what I learnt during the private lessons
After that, it depends on where you want to go after high school
If you want to get in a good university with a good bach, some start going to lessons as early as 9th or 10th grade
I know a lot of people who wanted to study Medicine who took harder Biology and Chemistry classes from 9th grade to get ready for the entrance exams
In 12th grade, a lot of people go to private lessons for the end of the year exams then
I personally went to a Bulgarian tutor for the 12th grade exams and I went to courses provided by the university I wanted to get into for their math exam, since it is much harder than the end of the year exam in Math
Prepaeing for university exams in school is impossible unless your school is specialised in what you want to study
Outside of school, it's very common to sign up kids for language lessons
There's an oversaturation of English courses - every second Bulgarian that's my age that I've met has gone to some course
German is also very popular, followed by French and Spanish
We store eggs in the fridge
no Life is Life
Bulgaria doesn't have good train connections tbh
The farthest you can go in one train is Budapest, thru Romania(if it still exists, I know it did back in 2018)
Others are Belgrade(done that, can't recommend), Thessaloniki and Istanbul
As I said I've done only one and it took something like 13 hours to do the ~450km route from my city to Belgrade
The part in Bulgaria wasn't that bad (did 140km for about 2 hours) but Serbia honestly has third world level of railways
If I am driving without stopping I can easily go to Austria or even Germany for those 13hrs
To answer your question - I draw the line at about 100km in our neighboring countries
After that I prefer busses/planes/cars etc
Man you should visit the Balkans
I learned at 21 years old
Most people, locals and foreigners, are very shocked by this
I was just never taught, and never owned a bike past the age of 5 or so
Never got to the point where they take off the training wheels
I'm not very confident while riding a bike but I'm actually glad I taught myself, despite loved ones trying to teach me (and giving up) over the years
A game where you are a bulgarian rebel (haidutin) who fights the ottomans
Something like wolfenstein but not Sci-fi
There was an obscure FPS that came out 10 or so years ago that was kinda that
You played as a time traveler from the future who went to the Roman Empire, the American Revolution and some other periods that I don't remember now
Edit: it's called Darkest of Days
Mix in some Mongols and it's complete
Anyone have nicknames for Bulgarians
We call Romanians 'Mamaligari' - basically eating mamaliga (maize poridge)
We call Serbs and pretty much every Slavic nation on the balcans 'Brate' - brother
Italians are called 'Jabari'. That means eating frogs
I think it's more appropriate for the French, but it is what it is
A nickname for Macedonians is 'Máke'
Very wide spread and derogatory term for gipsies is 'Mangal'. It means а vessel for transporting ember, fire or coal
We sometimes call the Germans "шваби" which in Bulgarian means people from Schwaben
It is not offensive or something just a "smart" way to talk about Germans without using the word Germans
Bulgaria
One of my Finnish friend claims that Swedes call Finland "Sweden's retarded little brother".
Doesn't that just mean "goodbye" in German
Tow periods come to mind:
Bulgaria during the rule of Tsar Simeon
The Bulgarian state had 3 seas at its borders, so they say stuff like "Bulgaria on three seas
The Balkan wars since we had just gotten our Unification and independence and we were beating armies while at disadvantage
Also during that time period we managed to besiege and capture the Odeon fortress, which was deemed impossible to capture by the Germans - and we did it in 3 days
The awakening era
You'll see these idiots putting pictures of levski and botev all over the place without even knowing they were socialists wanting to create a Republic
Additionally they always brag about our medieval history between 600 and 1300
wait you mean you guys were also SHIELDS AGAINST THE MUSLIM HORDES
From a personal experience: Pleven (I have bad memories from there)
Dimitrovgrad, Kardzhali, Pernik or Targovishte these are the cities which i will say are the worst
Ah, Pernik, so many stereotypes and low-quality memes
Yes they are but I try to talk as hard as I can
I come from a region in South-Eastern Bulgaria known for its very soft pronunciation
As my Ukrainian teacher said once people didn't notice she is a Russian(don't fight me she is indeed from a Russian family, raised in Ukraine) and people assumed she was born in here
Sometimes I just slip up
As for foreigners  - they just assume we are talking funny Russian and don't make difference between different dialects I think
I'm from Eastern Bulgaria or " the province". I mean, they call everything the province except the capital Sofia
When I lived in Western Bulgarian, a lot of people mocked me because of my accent and pronunciation
Everyone told me that I said every emphasis wrong
While in Eastern Bulgaria, we think the Westerners are those who can't speak
I think they are legal
Altho they shouldn't be and nobody should work for free
NOBODY
I've graduated and am working in the construction engineering sector in DK
Internships in it are an absolute must if you want to graduate - min
6 months (or one full semester) is required, and finding a position is entirely up to you, but companies have strong policies in favour of interns
Unpaid internships are not illegal but extremely rare
Companies usually pay a rather symbolic sum (around a third of what you would normally get as a junior employee) to interns
The choice whether you would like to extend your internship (either continue in your previous company or find another) is also up to you but not opposed by the university
If you do, then you are officially a student worker, with a slight increase in your payment plus a possibility to get SU on top (depending on the amount they are giving you)
If you reside and work in country A, but come from country B, country A is responsible for your health and social security
As a resident of country A you get the same rights and the same access to services, natives get
But if you've worked and retired in country A and after retirement move to country B, country A is responsible for your pension, while country B - for your health and social security
This is why many Brits retire in Bulgaria
Or at least
they used to before Brexit
They receive their British pensions and live in the countryside of Bulgaria where they can't spend much, because everything is cheap or they grow it themselves
Definetely chalga(turbo-folk in other slav countries)
Some prime examples of emberassing songs(but still very popular that we all listen to) include [Azis-Sen Trope] and [Azis-Ledena Kralica]
It's a music genre that was full with cheap music videos, absurdly funny and dumb lyrics and overplayed imstrumentals
Nowadays it's still the same, the music videos have become quite good though
For modern chalga that's popular/good:
Here's an old school song I love:
Also this one:
And here's a song made from a rapper in 1 week, which is somewhat of a parody of retro chalga/kyucheck:
And here are some modern chalga songs which are emberassing:
Gosho ot Pochivka and his ''fiesta of swear words in his songs''. Like the guy has at least 4 swear words in his sentences
isnt she Ukrainian lol
There's so much stealing/buying of songs in this genre it's honestly hard to keep track of everything
I know of a Romanian version of Sen Trope that was released after Azis's, but there could be a Serbian one too that I don't know of
About the origin of chalga, I think it's generally accepted that it was invented alongside turbo-folk, although some sources like Wikipedia state chalga was first and that the citizens of Yugoslavia copied it
In Bulgarian, it's fatherland (and there are st least two words that mean that) and mother's tongue
Not at all in the UK
Most houses are old, moldy and with old windows
But then, any recently renovated house will have these advance windows
I've barely ever seen windows that are not like that
Though, it depends on the age of the building
All new buildings have them, but if you see some unrenovated old ones then they likely will just have simple ones
Generally, the less urban, the higher chance of it being something else
Also generally the furhter east you go
Your experience may vary depending on the country, but overall in europe, they're more or less ubiquitous
Hmm I don't think there's anything good on Bulgarian YouTube sadly
They are a lot, but mainly two: The Clashers and 'Айде БГ. The latter make top 15 lists and challenges, and The Clashers makes tech reviews and stuff
Only reason I don't watch the other YouTubers is because they are pretty immature and make stupid and unfunny jokes
Maybe one exception is Tsvetoslav Tsonev
Yeah he's amazing
I shake hands with men that are not within my ring of closest people, and the same goes for women as well
My closest people - we hug out for greetings and for departures
Edit: mistakes fixed
I m a cat person, but most people here prefer dogs, and in my opinion the continent will be 50/50
Personal: As James from TheOdd1sOut would say: I'm bisexual for animals
^(wait)
Country: The impression I've gotten in my 21 years of living here Bulgarians seem to favor dogs
Continent: I don't know
While the official language is Bulgarian we do have a significant minority of Turks who speak Turkish if that counts
Sure, Kone doesn't sell to the avarage consumer, but I wouldn't say they are unknown
You see their brand on a lot of elevators and escalators in public places
Edit: same with ThyssenKrupp, Schindler and Otis
I'm curious, does Carl Zeiss make any products for B2C or only industrial products
Isn't Weber part of Saint-Gobain
They have products for B2C. Every big hardware store would have their cement mixes
Bulgaria: have one, but don't really need it
Use it maybe once a month for big stores like Ikea or for a day trips to places around city
There are plenty of buses, you can walk almost everywhere and work is 1 min walk from home
Russia: had one, used it quite often but mostly when with kids
Lots of people prefer cars, lots of people prefer public transport
Moscow is huge and though cars are more comfortable and convenient if you usual route is unusual, public transport is way more reliable
If your public transport commute is 2 hours that's it, always
With a car it could be 1 hour one day and 4 hours another
Porn is illegal I think
Criminal Code, Article 159:
A person who produces, displays, presents, broadcasts, distributes, sells, rents or otherwise circulates a pornographic material, shall be punished by imprisonment of up to one year and a fine from BGN 1,000 to 3,000
Anyone who distributes pornographic material by means of information or communication technology or in another similar manner shall be punished by imprisonment for up to two years and a fine from BGN 1,000 to 3,000
Which city in the Balkans do you consider as the most important and why
Why people tend to exclude Greece and European Turkey from the Balkans
They are literally defining the borders of the peninsula
Istanbul
Capital of the Eastern Roman Empire and the Ottoman Empire
Used to be a center of Orthodox Christianity and currently the center of Islam in Europe
Currently the most economically important city in the Balkans and from a historical pov is one of the most important cities in the world
I wouldn't call it the most important but Ohrid is underrated
Most people consider Greece more as Mediterranean same with Italy and Spain
They are part of Greco-Roman civilisation and usually especially before the financial crisis Greece was way richer and part of western world unlikely the rest of the Balkans
Also for Turkey many people consider them a mix of Middle East-Mediterranean people that speak a Turkic language while rest of balkans speaking indoeuropean language so this difference make many people to exclude them
But geographically both countries have a proportion of their land in balkans
It makes no sense to exclude Bulgaria from the definition
Geographically and culturally it is firmly situated in the Balkans
The Balkans are named "Balkan" after Bulgarian mountains tho
Most of the Balkans: are in Bulgaria
Westerners: Bulgaria isn't in the balkans
Okay
Interesting
Ohrid
Veliko Tarnovo
Instanbul
Athens
All better choices using your criteria
We learnt it different
Geographically the mainland yeah it is but usually Greece included with the rest of Mediterraneans like Italy and Spain
Mainland Greece is nearly a quarter of the total area of the Balkans
Isn't 90% of the Balkan range in Bulgaria
Anyway people often say that Bulgaria isn't in the Balkans
Americans specifically think Yugoslavia = Balkans and even calls the Yugoslav wars "The Balkan Wars"
Why wouldn't Greece be part of the Balkans
It is one of the 7 countries which has 100% of its mainland in the peninsula and accounts for about 23% of the Balkan territory
Hmmm nope
All their islands are not part of Balkan Peninsula but yeah I understand your point
I think especially northern Greece have more Balkan vibes but the south is more Mediterranean to me
I get it
As others have pointed out, the definition varies, whether you talk about culture or geography
I myself only know the geographical boundaries of the region, as I am also not familiar with cultural delimitations, if any
That is why I said 100% of the **mainland** which is 88% of the area of the country
I just never heard people define the Balkan peninsula around 'vibe'.
To be honest Greece especially the southern part I feel that has much more in common with Italy or Spain than North Macedonia or Bosnia
But that’s my thought
Greece has more Mediterranean vibes than the rest of the balkans
So that’s why I prefer to go for vacation there than the Black Sea and basically that’s the reason I usually consider them more as Mediterranean country than Balkan
If you asked 10 people in the Balkans 10 of them would
And I doubt any would include Slovenia
I have been to Greece many times and has big differences than the rest of neighbours like NM, Serbia even Romania
If I have to categorise Greece I would put them as Mediterraneans
They are slightly darker skinned than the rest and also they are somewhat more western than us
Also Turkey despite have land in Balkan Peninsula I wouldn’t consider them as that
They are closer to Middle East
But that’s my opinion ofc
Are we categorising people or a geographical location
By that logic, if Bulgaria was richer and spoke a different language, it would automatically be excluded from the Balkans
Why are you shocked
As an example Many People consider Czechia as Eastern Europe and Austria central or western despite geographically is more eastern
Is the first time ever you hear it
I wish
Just Yugoslavia
We're always left out :(
You might find some Roman ruins or some Thracian gold
But you might also find a shell bomb from ww2
I think it's quite common
More than you hear about it about Bulgaria
For example my dad found some old weapons
turned out it was a large battle from more than 300 years ago
Not that dense in some cities
We got bombed to bits and had our capitals burnt and got bombed again and then communism
I live in Stara Zagora, Bulgaria
Every day on my way to my university, I walk through a park filled with remnants of ancient monuments and columns with all sorts of inscriptions on them
In the university basement they have excavated a neolithic settlement with a few dwellings which are more than 8000 years old with some old stone tools and clay statues in them
Same in Bulgaria, we've been struggling to build in Thessaloniki because we haven't had it for like a thousand years now
One day, one day
The most common here is "zele" (cabbage) , but I've heard "marmalad " (marmalade) and "usmivka" (smile) as well
"Зеле" (meaning "cabbage") is traditional
However, "сирене" (cheese) is also a popular option
Usually it's whether we are or speak Russian
We're not and we don't. The other thing is, we usually get asked questions about the Yugoslav war or some bullshit about "the powderkeg of Europe". It gets old considering we didn't take any part in the Yugoslav war and haven't been in a war since WW2
There was this English guy who tried super hard to convince me that I speak and understand Russian after I told him I am Bulgarian
And told me that I was in denial and I was just pretending by saying that I don't speak nor I understand Russian because I have never studied it in my life
Then he started testing me by asking me some basic Russian words (idk how he knew them) which were very similar to Bulgarian and I knew them, and with that, he became absolutely convinced that I was pretending and lying
This was like asking 'Do you know what perfecto, dramatico, economico mean
YOU DO
OMG YOU SPEAK SPANISH WHY ARE YOU PRETENDING THAT YOU DON'T SPEAK SPANISH
> Bulgarians are particularly annoyed by the phrase "Russian alphabet"
Oh yeah, that one pushes all the buttons
> happy liberation day
Thank you
I'm afraid I can't even fake out ones
Eh Bulgaria has the cheapest booze but same goes for salaries
It helps with tourism tho
Oh boy, Ottoman Empire occupied Bulgaria for nearly 500 years, was separated in two after it split from it, had to get independence separately, then had two balkan wars on opposite sides and communism pretty much separated Bulgaria and Eastern bloc from the rest of the world so yeah if relations are improving, it's now
Created the Cyrillic alphabet
Hasn't changed its name since its founding in 681 AD
I mainly use potato for fries so if potatoes disappeared I'd just improvise with other vegetables and hide any weird flavours with mayo
In my country there is not a single place where they sell Doners without potatoes in it
Dont know how
Well i am from phone
I feel like it could be Bulgaria
Every sport in which we stand a chance (not many occassions though)
Well, the Balkans would either start fighting on the table, as we usually do, or get drunk with rakija or something and start dancing traditional dances to folk music
Imma be doing a sirtaki, as we call it
This is very accurate
I feel like that's the best description of the Balkans so far
No, Bulgaria is not 100% comprised of gypsies who will steal your TV
You guys really got the short end of the stick with "Roma" being a word
I will just take my leave,kind sir
10% I think
The last census was in 2011 iirc
Haha yes, this is trigger number 1
Хахаха, did I get your reply correctly
Gypsies in general
I don't know about the biggest ever but if we exclude anything politics-related (cuz that's a shitshow) then I think Pulev's harassment scandal was pretty viral
[Bulgarian boxer Kubrat Pulev kisses a journalist during an interview then she sues him for harassment
Well, I don't listen to pop, but was pretty shocked to learn "turn me on" does not refer to turning an engine, machine or switch on/ off
And he sings it like "champion" anyway
&#x200B;
Happy achievement
I myself could surely participate more
Sorry for that, but my time management still sucks
Anyway, I enjoy browsing this subreddit and learning about the other European countries so much
Greetings to all users here
Goddamn that's a nice salary
What do I have to do to earn this much in Finland
A moratorium on executing death penalties was introduced when the comunist regime collapsed but the actual Penal Code texts, perscribing the death penalty, were completely redacted to drop it, on 10^(th) of December 1998
Ironically, the last death penalty was executed 4 days before the moratorium came in effect
Yes, here if a holiday happens to be on Saturday/Sunday the Monday after it's a day off , but this year its a day off anyway because today is Easter Monday which is a day of by default
Yes, but the Orthodox Easter was this weekend, so we get the 3rd off and the 4th off as well because the 1st was on a Saturday
It is a day off, but not because of Workers' day
Last Sunday was Orthodox Easter, so we had a day off last Friday, are having one today and are going to have another one tomorrow
And, since this Thursday is also a major Orthodox Christian holiday (6th May - St
George's day), we are skipping work and school then as well
It transfers to Monday, but since Monday is already a holiday it goes to the first working week day, in this case Tuesday
So Tuesday, 04
05, is a day off because of 01
Knife
I would never trust scissors to be clean enough, even if I just washed them myself
As it should be done
Emperor Nicephoros, not a great emperor really, but a decent cup
Nikephoros I because we made a good cup out of his head
Pretty weird to pick Julius Caesar of all people as someone who was hard done by history
He literally wrote much of his own history and excelled at public relations
There are so many other emperors who were vilified more by contemporary historians
Caesar's reputation is so stellar that the titles Tsar and Kaiser were still used into the 20th century while not too many people know about the atrocities he committed during his military campaigns
Without having read the book in question, sounds like the author had an idea in mind and looked for ways to "prove" it, rather than honestly search for the truth
Our sources for the Antiquity are usually so few and brief that you can try to prove just about any thesis
The time of Julius Caesar's rise and fall is better documented than most periods prior to the High Middle Ages, sure, but it's still filled with humongous gaps, AFAIK
And now that I googled this Michael Parenti I see that he doesn't have a history degree and most of his books are about the twentieth century (and rather suspect, according to some posts on r/askhistorians as well) . Call me elitist, but I would rather trust historians with good reputation among academics, who specialise in the respective period
Anyway, a person can be a just reformer and a tyrant at the same time, many of the best known reformers in history were quite tyrannical indeed
I suspect the motives for the assassination of Julius Caesar were probably many and varied among his killers
Killing him to protect the oligarchy, never mind that the Populares were themselves a party full of aristocrats sounds to me like a very modern, rather forced reading of the situation but again, I am not particularly familiar with this period in history
Julius Caesar was a very complex and controversial figure, there is really no need to fully trust any single historian's view on the matter
We have a city named Pernik near the capitol, and people always joke that you"ll get beaten up if you go there
They also have a funny accent and drive VW Golf 3
Cinema center (Kinotsentar or Киноцентъра) in Sofia, Bulgaria
Its at the lower parts of Vitosha mountain and most TV shows and mainstream music videos are shot there
What can also be breathtaking is the air pollution in sofia
That's curious
In Bulgarian churka means "a small dick" as in a diminutive to the word
Never would have thought it would be a slur in Russian
Bit late to the party but most of Balkandji songs perfectly fit your criterua
[this one is my personal favorite]
Well , I nominate [The Black Sheep] from the band Ahat , the most famous Bulgarian metal/rock song .
I really like this [one] . I hope you like it too :) , sadly it doesnt have a national instrument involved in it
One of the only Bulgarian rock songs I know [Черната Овца]
There's a solid rock/metal scene in Bulgaria, a couple of classics are  [The Black Sheep by Ahat] and [Diamond and Glass by B.T.R.]
For Bulgaria it is chervenkov
He was our version of Stalin
The case that ruled ДПС constitutional is fascinating
ДПС is predominantly an ethic party, which is illegal under the Bulgarian constitution but they claimed that they were a liberal party to get around this
On the day of decision, two areas were considered for the first, 6 judges voted it was unconstitutional and 5 that it was
They are 12 judges in total, the other one was sick
For the second, it was claimed that the documents had not been submitted in time and it ought not be considered
This resulted in a non-verdict
The courts since refused to hear other cases arguing the matter is decided
ДПС has gone on to have a very colourful history in Bulgarian politics and participated in countless corruption scandals while acting as a king maker in politics
Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg
They used to be the precursors of the Shengen, because they generally had cross-border agreements before it (not sure about that)
Wealthy nations, especially Luxembourg, part of the floodplains of the southern edge of the continental ice during the last Ice Age
I know that Belgium has administrative division, based on ethnicity with each divisin having their own government and Brussels had this weird division as well
Belgium has 4 (?) official languages, Netherlands and Luxembourg have three (?)
More people work in Luxembourg than live in it - many people work there but commute to Germany or Netherlands where they live, thus the state's GDP is benefiting from that
The people of the Netherlands will save Bangladesh one day
Yes, Bulgarian has singular and plural "you" and "thank" is just a verb
You can add a pronoun or not
Probably it is more common to just say "blagodarya" but if you want to be more personal, you definitely add a pronoun "blagodarya ti" or "blagodarya vi".
If i understood you correctly, then here how its in Bulgarian to thank someone when speaking for yourself :blagodarya благодаря: and if your speaking for your group its :blagodarim благодарим: and then add :ti ти: (if you are speaking to 1 person), :vi ви: (if you are speaking to more than 1 person) and :Vi Ви: (This is for both if you are talking to 1 or a few people formally and yes its the same as when you are speaking in a casual conversation but with :V В: being capital) Also sorry if you had a stroke trying to read some parts of what i said
Rakia in case I get sick, need to clean something or want to get piss drunk
Flag to remind of great mother Bulgaria
My dog cuz otherwise the world would be dark
Potato
Soap
Deck of cards
Swiss knife
Baseball hat to hide my ugly head
Book

And maybe in would yet money or clothes or some other needles things if I had the space
You'd be surprised to find anything other than a crew cut or a buzz cut here tbh
Same thing here lol
Everything, to the word
I don’t think that’s true but I guess it might be where you live
I used to have long hair in my teenage years and I think the reason it’s a lot less common than short hair is because it takes much more effort to maintain and during summer it just gets way too hot
>Богомолка
Bogomolka
It means "she who prays to God"
The Mystery of the Bulgarian Voices - they've been touring the world since the 70s.
Assuming I work a low-wage job in a high-pay country just because I'm Bulgarian ... smh
yikes
Help WESTERN Europe
Four or five
I work about 25h a week at an art store, I get to use the wifi and read books when it isn't busy
Every employer is required by law to insure you, so I've got that covered, I get insured on full-time but I get half the yearly paid vacation because my hours technically qualify as part time
There's a coffee machine, and that's about it
Pretty good compared to most jobs in the entire country
It is perfect actually, I love it haha
Yes, we have paid sick leave
You can take up to 10 consecutive days from your G.P, anything more (up to six months) requires a sort of "medical council" with more than one doctor, I think
Your first few days off, your salary is covered by your employer, the rest is covered by insurance
This has happened to me in Sofia
I wish people would feel this comfortable and friendly even when they're not drunk
The coming of Cyril and Methodius' students to Bulgaria
Tsar Boris asks them to create literary school in Ohrid and Preslav (Pliska at first)
This event is important because with the creation of the Cyrillic alphabet and the development of a Bulgarian culture, during the time of Simeon, the Bulgar nobility is completely assimilated into the Slav population, creating what can finally be called Bulgarians
Edit: or the revival period, from Istoriya Slavyanobulgarska (1762) to our "independence" in 1878
During this period authors like Ivan Vazov take up the task to recreate and modernize Bulgarian literature, grammar and spelling
Interestingly enough a sizeable chunk of what is said in literature from that time can be applied to modern Bulgaria
The songs, poems and books had a goal in mind when they were written, to awaken the Bulgarian people and light the fire in their hearts for freedom, this is a tough task - trying to make people want freedom when they know the cost of blood that will have to be spilled, having been enslaved for 500 years and having numerous failed rebellions
I would add the April Uprising of 1876 as it helped Bulgaria to finally gain recognition and on the fact what is really happening in the Ottoman empire
Also the Unification between East Rumelia and thr Bulgaria Kingdom
Two words: DROB SARMA
It’s popular, it has liver, it’s nasty and can make me vomit by simply being near me
I dont think its a popular food but I absolutely despise mish-mash
Its got my vote for the worst food maybe in the history of Earth itself
> there is a tendency to stereotype every European cuisine other than France, Italy, Spain, Greece and Portugal as horrendous and bland
This makes the Balkans cry every time
Liver smells horrendous to me
We call that pacha in Bulgaria
I remember looking it up and so many countries have it all over the world and I cannot understand why the fuck its a thing
It's so disgusting
I love the taste of mish mash but the texture is too soft on it's own
It needs something to make it not feel like eating vomit
>One of my favorite foods though are dolmas, which are Greek I think
A lot of countries have that dish not just Greece
But every country has their regional variations on exact ingredients and their ratio
One of my favorite things to eat is pasta with butter and feta (but the Bulgarian version that is very tangy)
In the US the most popular known version is the Greek one for sure
But things like musaka, spinach pie, baklava, feta, gyros/döner/etc
, tzatziki, souvlaki, etc
are part of the cuisine from the Balkans to the Middle East (and some occasionally found elsewhere)
But there are regional variations and they're sometimes called different names
Cool thing is if you like one of them there's like 10 different versions of it you can try lol
People drawing graffiti everywhere, even monuments
There are 28 in the whole country - 17 in Sofia, 3 in Varna , 2 in Plovdiv , 2 in Burgas,  2 on Trakia highway, 1 in Sunny Beach,  1 on Hemus highway
There are somwath popular in Sofia and not as much in the rest of the country
There are quite a few of them in Bulgaria, at least 4-5 in Sofia
A shame we can’t get some *better* American fast food here, like Taco Bell or Chick Fil A. I think Taco Bell would be wildly popular here
And that is exactly the reason why the UK is one of the most obese nations in the world
The average income in the capital is almost twice as high as the rest of the country, so life in Sofia is more expensive as well
That being said, prices for basic stuff like food etc
aren’t that different
The biggest difference is the almost crippling shortage of kindergartens and nurseries
The deficit is in the thousands and the problem is so serious people protest it regularly and some parents have formed communal kindergartens in order to cope
Currently you can call the Ministry of Interior affairs and ГДБОП (specialised police) our drug kingpins
I'd guess Kurdzhali province, since it's right at the southern border and it's populated primarily by ethnic Turks
I mean, the government would have to fuck up pretty badly for this to happen, but if any place were to secede, Kurdzhali would be it
None really, although there is a province in the southeast part of Bulgaria with Turkish majority but those don't seem to be inclined for independence/integration in Turkey
Other than that in the southwest province of Blagoevgrad there's a NMacedonian 'party' which makes a fuss about secession every now and again, but their number is a few hundred which compared to the 320 000 living in the province is nothing
Btw there was a protest movement in the Northwest to have three provinces join Romania because of the alleged "ignoring" of the region when it comes to funding and development
It went nowhere and was largely seen as a joke/protest here
Unite Bavaria, Austria and Switzerland and have the ultimate Alpenrepublik
You wouldn't be too happy if California suddenly decided that it isn't a part of the US anymore, would you
I'll waste a few leva or volunteer for the Slovene army if it comes to fighting the Austrians
Yes, there are stray dogs everywhere especiallyin big citiessuch as Sofia, Plovdiv,  Pernik etc
, but even in my small 5k town there are 2 packs that most of the time are harmless but some times lash on people and scare children
Oh we have a shit ton, not a city or village in Bulgaria where you won't see some sorta stray animal
Yes, both
In sofia it’s terrible
In Burgas there are probably only a few stray dogs but a lot of cats
I don’t know about the country as a whole but the town where I live(Pirdop, it’s a fairly small town about 80 km to the east of Sofia) has a fairly large amount of strays
I know my mom was once bitten by one and my brother got scared by one
I don’t spend much time in Pirdop because of School and Uni, the current pandemic situation not withstanding, but I haven’t had any problems with strays
All kinds of stray animals in Sofia, mostly cats
If I had to guess it's about a 10:1 ratio of cats to dogs
It's worse in smaller towns, I think
Stray dog pack do a lot more than scare children
In the last years there are more active efforts to castrate them, so at least there are no fatalities recently
Yes, thats what lash on people is there, my grandfather was attacked and bitten a few times 4 or 5 years ago
And yea , the castration is more active than it was years ago
Here blue pens seem to be mare used than black , or other colors
No, usually the dialects are considered not correct
Open faced sandwich with meat and/or cheese, topped with fresh cut tomato and some 'colourful salt' (popular mix of herbs and spices)
Commonly referred to as a "princessa" but some parts of the country call it a "strandjanka". This is a topic of debate and heated argument, whether they are different, how so, and which is correct
Probably going to be what our next civil war is about
I'm a subway boi
Uh we aren't bankrupt yet
Fiscally Bulgaria is actually in a pretty good spot
Privacy who needs that, right
We're kinda in the same situation
Says who
Boyko
The data
Country has 20% debt to GDP ratio which is one of the lowest in Europe
From 2016 to 2018 our budget surplus has grown by 1 percent per year
Our credit rating was upgraded last year
Country is farthest from being bankrupt since the creation of Modern Bulgaria
I don't trust Boyko's data
Shady as fak
Here to travel with train is the cheapest,  but also slowest transportation,  I personally enjoy it , there are a lot of people hating it . So,  for example one way ticket from Sofia to Plovdiv (around 160km
/2h 30m ) is 9
15 leva (~ 4
60€) whitout discount ( 50% off for school and uni
students) .
And probably one of the longest in the country  Sofia - Varna (around 510km
/8 hours) is 23
35 leva (~11
70 €) , one way,  whitout discount
Here in Bulgaria trains are kinda slow (130km/h on main lines, realistically more like 60-90km/h on most lines, so usually slower than car, about the same speed as a bus, and the rolling stock is quite old (they have recently began to refurbish trains along main routes and adding more conveniences like power outlets and dining cars) but they are also VERY cheap
Stara Zagora to Sofia (250km, about 3:45 by train) is about 7€, with a discount it's €3,50
Free discount cards are issued to all students (incl
university) and pensionners and anyone else can buy one (€25 for 1 year)
Children under 7 travel free and bikes and pets are allowed on all trains (bike ticket is 1€ regardless of the destination), and there are also various other types of discounts like return tickets, small group tickets and so on
Sofia-Varna (520km, 8h travel time) with a sleeping coach (there are options to reserve a cabin for 1-3 people) is €17, about 10euro with a discount card
So yeah, train travel is very affordable
I have a 50% discount that costs 35€ which allows me to buy return ticket to the other side of the country for 17€
Dirt cheap
The trains are old and very slow, but the prices are very low, even by our standards
And there is a 50% discount for students and retirees
For example: a ticket from my hometown to Sofia (the capital), a trip that typically takes about 4 and a half hours by car, would take 6 hours and 10 minutes by train, but would only cost about €10, or €5 with the discount
Edit: forgot to mention: the trains are extremely comfortable
They are quite spacious as they are (waaay more so than a plane or a coach), and they are often also half-empty
So, a train is the best way to travel if you value your comfort more than your time
Same thing here
It's Bulgarian literature so nobody cares but the one I had most difficulty with was nikolay haitov - divi razkazi, or wild tales
I haven't even finished them so maybe I should revisit it
For Russian the toughest read is life and fate by vasili grossman
Just very long and too many characters where it switches too often between them and you lose track
For Dutch I'd say Harry mulisch - the discovery of heaven
Found it a bit pretentious
I read all of them, but this one killed me
Only read 1/3 of it
Not sure if any of my classmates finished it
Lol no, it's already a Bulgarian word since ancient times
It's just generally slavic
No man, the Dutch are just a bit xenophobic so they come up with all kinds of nonsense stereotypes for other countries
Not all Dutch people of course, but this seems to be one of them
All my money goes to taxes and bills
No money left for anything, my salary is considered good here
För me it is Swedish
I believe the photo is taken at Schloss Nymphenburg in Munich
See [here
To me, this sounds great
I'll try to be as active as possible
Reading some of the replies here makes me think we don't have it as bad
I think for us is the national TV which is probably the least bad of them all
БНТ1, the state's channel, followed bTV and Nova
БНТ (Bulgarian national television) has surprisingly kept its prestige even after the fall of communism and now has an array of four channels that feature the news, sporting events, TV show, movies and a lot more - it's pretty good in that regard
It's part of the big three broadcasters in Bulgaria, the other two being Nova and bTV
From a political pov they're all equally shit at being objective and you're better off even using Facebook or chatting with people to inform yourself about politics
Edit: I'm not sure whether the question was asking about the channel when you hit 1 on your remote or the best channel
I answered the former
church services
dang
oh wow, that's surprising
Here almost nobody cares about the church except some nutjobs and nationalists
It's instant Balkan scenario literally
I thought that the marijuana sold in coffee shops in the Netherlands is being grown by the government
Well, recently I found out that I was completely wrong
I remember asking dad if Aachen was in East Berlin
>like the Chechen, get massively oppressed
The same Chechens who drove out all Russians out of their republic and now run it practically as an independent country with generous subsidies
If the Chechens are oppressed, it's by other Chechens
>Sometimes also exterminate
What minorities were exterminated in Russia
This is deportation, not extermination
There are those things at Bulgarian tables too but we don't care lol
Me too
It made me feel kind of insulted lol
Each number from one to ten has a unique name, the numbers between 11 and 19 have the “надесет” (nadeset) suffix which means “ontop of ten”, so they are three on top of ten
Each consecutive decade of numbers follows the pattern: двадесет (dvadeset), meaning “two tens”, followed by “и {number name}” (and  {number name}”) and like this up to a hundred
The hundreds have a unique name - “сто” (sto)
So 400 is четиристотин (chetiristotin) followed by the decimals etc
Thousands are хиляда (hilyada) for 1000 and following the same pattern
In addition to gerginborisov's answer the rules for reading them out have nothing special 12489 would be read as twelve thousand fourhundred eighty nine
Pretty straightforward
In my city (Stats Zagira, Bulgaria) a former military base has been made into a public park, with a skate park and indoors sports arena being constructed right now
They kept the name Artillery park from the former military brigade that was housed there
Not really :(
Freestyler as well
Antique were pretty big in Europe
If by international OP means Balkan-wide fame, then the list is much longer and is primarily pop-folk, Vasilis Karras and such
If someone said hi to the people in the bus, they'd be considered crazy
I mean
that only works when you enter a train compartment and ask if the seats are taken
We've forgotten the crackers
They've become pretty popular here too in the last 10-15 years
Most men who can grow one, do
In the 90s and especially in Communist times it was either frowned upon or people were straight up told to shave it by their boss
I am really proud of my country taking measures and deciding not to play because of the pandemic
Of course, haven't you seen the results against Switzerland and Italy
For us human rights are more than crucial
Italian  My mom is a huge Adriano Celentano fan so I grew up listening to Italian music
Still want to learn it to this day
Basil II the Bulgarslayer is the most obvious example I can think of
There are streets named after him in Greece, for example
>Gotse Delchev
This is surprising
I'm not aware of him doing anything against the Greeks
The Bulgarian-Greek conflict started after his death
Haiduts ... Bulgarian outlaws that lived in the mountains and robbed ottomans during their occupation of Bulgaria
And of course someone mentioned cossacks
those guys were fucking cool
They looked fucking [cool] too
Tbh, now
Living standards are best todays, most peaceful time
If I had to pick it would be still somewhere in the 21th century
Comments here give the impression that PiS is a party made up of a bunch of triple-Hitlers that eat babies for breakfast and shoot gay people for sport in the afternoon before torching some immigrants
The way Poland has been going, I'm willing to bet they're going extreme far right
Pretty ironic for the country that holds the location of Auschwitz within its borders
You're not allowed to hope that, it's reddit
And on the spectrum (or compass), are they up or down
For reference, down is Liberal and up is authoritarian
1 in Sofia with showrooms in Varna and Plovdiv but are planning on building a new one in Varna
We have one in the Capital
Edit: There are also some small stores in the larger cities
To be fair, a high percentage of homes in a lot of countries are IKEA
The best way to define where your country is is by at your neighbours
Taihumian Republic - definitely Sahelian, with maybe the North being considered Saharan
Mumbambu - very Persian gulf-esque, but the majority Pastafarian population puts it culturally closer to Jamaica and Papua New Guinea
Kingdom of Acadia - quite tricky to determine, but I'd say it's more South American than Siberian, but some might say it actually belongs in Northeastern Australia
The despotic people's dictatorship of Hafaria - Arctic by nature, Antarctic by culture
So, I'd say that Montenegro is definitely Middle-Near-Far-West-North-Eastern Afro-South-Americo-Asio-European, with a few Polynesian and Martian hints
Hope this helps
Yes, and I'll never be convinced that it's not stupid to leave your dirty ass shoes on while home (or god forbid laying on your bed/couch with them on, which seems to be a thing according to American movies)
I've got house shoes (sandals) for indoor wear, which I thought was the norm
Boyat nastana to me is a song that could have been or anthem
Well i would say Turkish
Its mostly spoken in the Southeast, alongside the border and especially in the Kardzhali oblast/region and also in the Northeast in the provinces of Razgrad, Shumen, Targovishte, Silistra and some parts of Dobrich and Varna have it as their mother tongue
if we somehow qualify we are screwed
I don't understand comments like this
What support
The EU countries' support
The support of every European country
Do you really think most people in real life give a shit or have an opinion about Scotland's independence
Comments like that are cringy as fuck
It's a reddit thing, nobody gives a shit in real life
No, you are cringy
Pop folk- a.k.a. chalga
It was chosen to be in the centre of the Bulgarian lands but now it’s at their western edge
You can say " Ne mi puka" or "Ne mi dreme"  they both can be translated as I don't care
You can use " Prez kura mi e " witch literally means It goes through my dick
We have expressions like "не ми пука" ([it] doesn't pop on/with/whatever me) or "не ми дреме" ([it] (presumably the problem) isn't napping on me)
The affirmative forms "пука ми" (It's popping on me) and  "дреме ми" (it's napping on me) emerged from the negatives to mean "I do care", but are now used mostly sarcastically, so both the negatives and the affirmatives mean "I don't care".
Not really, it just originated as sarcasm
"Meh, [as if] I care".

Check out [International Dialects of English Archive] I've linked to the Bulgarian accents but you can check out your own country's, too
I suggest this one:
It's probably the best thing ever written by a Bulgarian, apart from poetry
It's... incredible
I absolutely recommend it
In our language just about every name has several nicknames
They can end in vowels or consonants depending on the name itself and don't follow tendencies of any kind
Perhaps that's because our names come from several different origins (there are native Slavic names, Greek ones, newly introduced American ones,  Russian ones that were popular during the Communist regime, Turkish and Roma ones for our main minorities, etc)
There's no tendency, no suffixes, no rules
There are just several nicknames that just 'sound right' for every single personal name
Oh no anything but that
This sounded like great news until I remembered we're leaving the EU
LoL, like is that supposed to be a legitimate threat by FB
"If you don't stop regulating us, we'll
, we'll stop offering you our shitty service that only middle aged women use
Oh, no
How else will my mom share pictures of her favorite soap opera and follow Gokberk Demirci
Lol, I can understand not fully having Turkey in the picture but cutting off Istanbul like that is dirty
500k is too few for its own site
Dark Humor and memes had a couple millions (if I remember correctly) and the site they made was more inactive than the discord server (which the mods abandoned one by one and eventually one of the new guys on the team nuked it
Fuck that lad it was the funniest shit)
Please don't use the S-word if you don't want to alienate all of the eastern member states
Yes, their problem is that they don't have the financial capacity for an advertisement campaign
Is it ban evasion if you make your own thing though
It's not like you were banned from the entire internet
Cheers
I will drink to that bro
Point is that the population still loves welfare, healthcare (just don't ask about taxes) and government regulation
They just don't like anything associated with the old system, especially the term it used to describe itself
Nice, now do the same for laptops please
Well USB C is already on it't third major USB gen and it has flexibility and room to grow even more
(USB 3, USB3,2 and USB 4)
Also this directive just says that A standard needs to exists not WHAT the standard IS
That is up to the USB-IF to decide
They do not count under Radio Equipment so probably not
But USB C can supply most common laptops and we can probably have a USB 4-C x2 that has double the power lanes for the really power hungry ones if it is really needed
Cause Apple
Remember the Great Charger Soup of the 2000s? Yeah how did that stifle innovation
Last I checked the USB standard introduced to stop it by EU demand is on it's 7th major version
It is because until this directive started to be drafted Apple was using it's own shit so they can sell you a dongle
With this no future Apples can screw the consumers by making their own speshul ports just so they can charge you extra
(Yes I know Lightning is good but Apple lost it's chance to beeing the next USB standard by charging a nice sum per port)
Like it slowed USB inovation when they demanded common chargers
I mean it is not like USB is on it's 7th revision:
USB 1
USB 2
USB 2
0 Revised
USB 3
USB 3
USB 3
USB 4
Reason is so people who use apple can use public utilities provided in the EU like charging ports
Why would we
Type C is actually designed for what it does
Unlike the old ones that were not meant to go on phones but for niche applications, before of course they had to standardise
And while yes there have been multiple revisions on Type C (5 total so far), so has the previous one
Those are not gags
Try again
And you can do so with power sockets
Still annoying to have the extra 20 adaptors that you do not use 99% of the time but they had to be manufactured and the resources wasted  and pollution created
By that point the only way to go is wireless
As the old ones are not significantly smaller if at all
I hate this narrative
Those cars are used by other *people*, you know
great, geoguessr will become even harder
They're so normal that I'm not actually sure if there's ads like that where I live
No need for /s, Poland needs to get its shit together
What are they proving in the middle of summer
They do this at a couple of places in Bulgaria too
This is widespread in Europe, they do it as far east as Bulgaria
And it's not new
People with celiac disease or thyroid conditions probably love that
You mean they'll get some kind of allergic rash just from touching pasta with their lips or what
It gets in the water
Well, she's an idiot
Football is an entertainment industry, so whoever gets people entertained gets paid more, and people like Ronaldo entertain people a LOT
She isn't paid the same as Ronaldo because there are many biological researchers and there is only one Ronaldo
In the labor market supply and demand regulate wages
There could be a great demand for biological researchers, but there might also be a great supply of biological researchers, so wages dont go above what companies or the government are willing to pay for them
Sure you can do that, but that's not what she's saying
She trying to imply that football players are more valuable than researchers
What system would be better
Capitalism isnt perfect, but it's the closest thing we have to an automatic evaluation of how much we should pay for something
Governments in the eastern bloc tried to control these things and we know how that turned out
Of course a single person who is popular like Ronaldo will get paid a lot because there dont seems to be so many people like Ronaldo
Its not like if i become a football player i will be paid a million euros
I don't think the state should have control of industries
Let's say the vaccine research industry
The state could offer a sum of money to any company that finds a vaccine for the coronavirus, this way there for sure are going to be companies willing to develop a vaccine because of the reward and the competitiveness of the market would still be there, so costs would be low
Well looking at the number of players La liga has, its not that large - 485 players, and second league is 533
So around a thousand people
Sure you can talk about how large their salaries are, but there arent that many, a LOT less than there are researchers
And btw a biologist in Spain doesn't earn 1,800 euros, from what i can find online its 3,000 euros minimum
&#x200B;
Everything you're using right now is a product of competition
In every industry, companies are competing for either your money or attention and have been doing so for a long time
So why isn't Britain offering them to an EU tour
Imperial twats lol
As you can see, Greece has kept 5x of the cargo just as safe
I guess the famous ISIS invasion of Greece missed them
It can still have being stolen as a part of its history in Greece
I love how you're questioning Greece's ability to preserve a statue under a picture where you can clearly see not one but five statues of its kind perfectly preserved
In Greece
Can I judge
Not even sure with Bulgaria's military history what atrocity I'm gonna learn about next
I mean, it's kinda your fault if you leave your car in a state that's easy to steal
What's her name
What are her political views
What are here proposed policies
These don't matter do they
..why
Because it is staged and the smoke makes the situation seem more dramatic than it actually is in real
Even if the lady in the pic happens to be a lesbian, that doesn't stop her from caring about a right that primarily impacts straight women
And it impacts her too because the right to abortion is for all women, no matter their sexual orientation
One doesn't really need to personally benefit from a certain right to care to protect it
most of those (at least in Bulgaria) say that max vaccination during a pandemic is dog shit, not to mention the measures taken to "control" it
What cause
I just learned about this on the morning news
This is heartbreaking
So bulgaria isn’t in EU now
Well played sir
I cannot believe this just happened
Didn't even realise till halfway through the song that I've been rickrolled, I'm not even mad
I fell for it 5 months later
*NordVPN intensifies*
Update, works just fine with a Bulgarian server
The fuck is with this whoosh on my comments
Why
No mercy for noobs
>Have you seen the size they wanted Bulgaria to be after we gained independence
You mean the treaty of San Stefano
At that point in time almost all of that land had a majority Bulgarian population with the exception of parts of Macedonia (Greek)
Largely thanks to all the Turks that were forced to vacate it during the Russo-Turkish war
I've just done a month touring the Netherlands in a camper (working my way around all of Europe over a few years) and The Netherlands and the Dutch are by far my favourite place in the world; I feel home sick for The Netherlands when I don't feel homesick for my native UK
If you're visiting don't bother with Amsterdam; it's become just another pretty European city, instead go East for Utrecht, Muiden, South for Hellevoetsluis, or North for Giethoorn
Naval history, amazing fortifications, beautiful mix of old and new architecture, a pretty church, lovely people, tall ships, historic Dutch barges, delicious food, awesome locals, free parking, a yatchs on the lake, even the police were cool
If the owner of the multi million dollar luxury yacht "Erica" choose to moor her there it's got to be good
The sad part is that even these jokes give her more credit, than she has
Yeah, the transparent plastic gives it a trashy view . The cat is classy enough to go above that
Who fucking won
Our first representative was a socialist lol, but he wouldn't have lived if the socialist dictatorship he lived under had their way
Actually, he witnessed a dear friend of his sacrifice himself to save him, all avoidable if it wasn't for the tyranny
I bet he was so proud to be a socialist as he sat at the open casket funeral of his burnt and mangled friend
I bet he was even more proud when he recalled about how it was very preventable
Shut the fuck up
Soviet socialism was shit, people died, Gagarin went to space as a human, not as a puppet of some commie dictator
And I sincerely hope that "soon to be Norway" isn't because you heard Americans call Scandinavia socialist, because you'll be very disappointed once you go there if that's the case
Does it really matter
More than a few Turks are epic dudes
Bro I literally don't give a shit about your country
The USA was never even mentioned lmfao, don't get your panties in a twist because we dare have a discussion where we don't jerk off the US
No, country responsible for millions of deaths bad
We both come from the Balkans, we love our war crimes, and both our countries combined still have a better track record in hundreds of Europe than the USSR did in less than a hundred
Wasn't as easily preventable
They were volunteers
Sorry for forgetting that every time a Russian takes a shit a Serbian has a meal
You're worse than one of the worst
What do you think my point is
She's still not the longest-reigning monarch in European history
That would be Louis XIV, who sat on the throne for 72 years
Kinda helps that he was crowned at the age of 4
Her reign is also shorter than that of King Rama IX of Thailand and Johann II of Liechtenstein
She'll have them all beat in 4 years, though
looks like a civ leader screen
We all know she's gonna live forever lmao
Най-накрая виждам някой друг от България
That seems like an arbitrary distinction to me
If we're going by actual political power, does that not rule out Elizabeth II
This is terrible for the truckers
I don't live in the UK but I order stuff from there through a third party shipping company because it's cheaper than a courrier like DHL
The service actually stopped accepting packages after the 19th with the last truck leaving then
The trucks usually take 7 days to get here, this last one is still in the UK 4 days later
Shit must be wild
good thing my father is in the other half of the continent and in the opposite direction
hey Brexit we at least know how to drive and stop acting like if you don't do it I've been there I've seen you
What the hell is this Guardians of the Galaxy extra lmfao
Looks like Willem Dafoe
So Muslims can't draw the Prophet or God but the Devil is fair game
Talk about blatant discrimination
There needs to be reforms to Islam, if Christans and other such religious can change to live in today's society, so can Islam, and I'm pretty sure there are any abundance of sects that are more progressive but have been condemned and silenced by a extreme part of Islam
> Romania OK results
Reeeeeeeee
Bruh, Greece 2 levels above Bulgaria, Turkey, Serbia etc
Otherwise it's pretty spot on haha
I believe that switching Ukraine and Russia's colors would be most accurate
Looks about average
hey hey hey Bulgaria is in the OK graph come on
I'm not biased of course
I'd put Bulgaria in worrying results
also portuguese deadass sounds like polish/russian
Tbf Slovenia and Greece in usually in most maps and indexes way better than the rest of the Balkans though
But I agree Turkey shouldn't be in same category with us
They would have been at least orange
Compare to EU yes we have to be orange or red, but compare with Europe as a continent no we are in the correct category
Also Turkey have to be in orange category for sure
Right back at you Ireland
Hahaha, how nice of you
right back at y'all
No fondness of rakija
You get your money back long term - the health benefits are obvious, you are creating a better market for electric vehicles so there is more incentive for competition and lower prices for the consumer, if im in a neigbouring country its entirely realistic to travel to Norway to buy such a car, which could insert more money in the economy
We have the same in several cities
Works just as well
800 comments and no one has noticed that this is total BS
You can't reliably distinguish closely related ethnicities from one another like that and there is no evidence that this is actually real
Traditional gowns and braids of the Pomak village of Startsevo, Bulgaria
Cool, I would have liked a picture of the full dress, though
That is
interesting considering I am from Bulgaria and I have never heard/seen a custom for having Rapunzel level braids
Not surprising considering the mongrel that I am
ITT: DAE People saying cultural appropriation bad
Hey, sorry, couldn't find other pictures of the girl on the right in this exact dress (ran out of time), but [here's] another one of her in a different top dress that is somewhat similar
There are more photos of her on Facebook for sure (I remember seeing her in the albums from 2016-2017) that were uploaded from the [Zheravna Festival] in the exact dress that OP posted
Edit: Found more photos: [1] [2]
I think these photos are from the Zheravna festival that happens annually (not counting 2020) in Bulgaria, where people all wear traditional dress that was typical for the 19th century
All kinds of traditional dress are welcomed, though since it's a festival in Bulgaria the vast majority of people wear the clothing typical for Bulgaria
For the most part only approved photographers are allowed to take photos (modern devices like cameras  and cell phones are banned) and the photos are then upload on Facebook after the event
I posted a link to the page where you can find more photos in a comment a bit higher in the thread
I think this is from the Zheravna festival
You can find more at @photozheravnafest on FB
You can check the gallery of the [Jeravna festival of the folk costume] \- this is an annual festival celebrating the Bulgarian national garb (and not only Bulgarian
) taking place in Zheravna
As far as I remember the hair is part of the ornament
It's real hair
Basically women would save their hair, braid it and later pass it down the generations to daughters and granddaughters
I wonder if analog cameras would be welcome
I'd love to take some shots with my zenit in a place like that
I agree with this
I think it stems from white Americans having very little culture after their ancestors decided to move away/reject the culture they'd been part of for thousands of years
Black people in america have endured ethnic eradication - they never really know their origins, their ethnicities, their native languages
Colonisers took that from them and for centuries they were nameless slaves
This is the reason "black culture" exists, but white culture doesn't.
White people have the luxury of not having their skin colour tied to their origin
Every white person in america can tell you exactly what kind of european descendant they are
So being proud of their "whiteness" comes off as racism, instead of being proud of whatever their actual origins are - german, irish, polish, italian
Black american people aren't saying white people have no cultures
They're denying the existence of a unified "white culture".
Stalin approved
Europe is a colony to the great Brazilian super power
Bulgaria should be on fire
damn it's teasing me even more I want to see it in person
Wow
The title is misleading
The villa was discovered a century ago
The news now is that the mosaic is finally being unearthed
How do you know they were nationalists
Buddy I think we got the right to call ourselves that
You are more like Pennsylvania maybe
Close enough to the civilized states that it might call itself one, surprisingly rich, lots of weird religious people and a desire to break stuff on days of celebration
Idk man, I'm freezing up here in Scotland
I just love British weather maps
Especially how you don't have the capitol of a 20m country but have Burgas, my hometown of 200k on the map
Sunny beach weather more important I guess
Let's cranck it up babaay
With any luck winter will be totally gone in a few years
It really sucks as it obviously shouldn't be happening but I have to admit I am enjoying all the sun and warmth we've been getting in Bulgaria
Why is this map showing our 4th largest city when other countries are either missing a city or have their capital and another
lol
Does anyone know how that would affect yield
Same down here
There are days there's no point in turning on the heating at home
If this keeps up I don't want to imagine what July will feel like
Worst of all it's dry as hell
Some rain here and there, but for the most part nothing
Where I'm at it snowed for a total of 3 times this winter and the snow barely lasted a day before melting
Me too
I hate cold so much
People downvoting you and comments related to yours are truly pathetic
This might actually be the best 'winter' of my life
Not walking around with a jacket during February would've been like a fairy tale for me before

You have to admit tho, that's a pretty gangsta move

Wow, if we just jad a good snow in Southern Bulgaria
He was very badly poisoned so if the Russians don't kill him themselves, the poor conditions and the after effects of the poison may finish him off
Paradoxically, a Russia that returned Crimea to Ukraine would not be Democratic since it would be in clear violation of the Russian constitution and against the will of the people
This guy is so retarded I'm ashamed that he's Slavic
It's fine though cause he is calling for his own extermination
Congratulations, you played yourself
The snuu of thi sub doesn't go well with most of most top pictures
Blows my mind every time, and we all have them too
Any time I've tried discussing it with one of ours it's some daft shit like "Well, Hitler said that after the war there will be only one capital on the Balkans and that will be Sofia
". The fuck does that even mean and are you 12 for believing it
> Since we know the Nazis would never go back on their word
No, they're people of their word
Ask the Czechs
There were some really good infrographics(?) a couple months back comparing Trump and Hillary's policies on A LOT of things, is there something like that out in English, or would I just be forced to read a shit ton of articles to figure out where they stand on a bunch of things
Wooo GO FRANCE
Beautiful
I don't see how getting goods and services for cheap if you are poor is a fundamental right at all
My country's infrastructure is really depressing
This calls for an EU-wide company that should regulate this project
I'm up for it
> The airplane tickets are too cheap as they are not factoring in the true cost of all the externalities that the carbon emissions are creating
That's not a thing
Literally nothing to do with rights, at all
It's the definition of a privilege that you want for free
Luxembourg is an outlier so far out and so weird that giving it as a model for something like the EU shows that you oversimplify your views to the point of false equivalences not even phasing you
You don't have the right to travel because you are a worker, you have the right to spend the money you were compensated for by giving your expertise and time for whatever you wish
Do I get the right to a weekend at the Bahamas because I work 40 hours a week
The answer is obviously no
The only way for this to happen is a specialized tax, similar to how we do health care
Which BTW will cost everyone money, nothing is free
The train system is expensive, goods and services require resources and someones time
I am against such a tax because it will actually leave poor people, who are living month for month, a privilege that they will probably not be able to take advantage of(because they are poor I fail to see how the smallest expense in a holiday will help them afford said holiday or even time off) and in the end leave them worse of
By your logic I'm also entitled to a hotel as a fundamental right as well as an Xbox since well, I worked for 40 hours a week and rich people can afford it too
It's totally an absurd concept
You need to flesh out your arguments more, simply saying because I think so does not allow me to understand your position and opinion better
That doesn't cost money
At least nothing beyond buying the fuel

Next the EU functions nothing like the BeNeLux
Because it's a union of very different states and a lot more people
What works there does not work for the whole union, you give a baseless statement
The weirdest thing is that Dutch public transport is not becoming free in 2020, so I fail to see how saying BeNeLux means that free transortation is coming to Belgium and the Netherlands
So even if what you said is true, and BeNeLux is a 1 to 1 homomorphism to the EU, it does not actually support your claim
There is also a difference in infrastructure cost between public transport defined as metros and bus routes etc, and traveling between cities
I don't think all these things are as comparable to each other as you make it seem
I see no plans or push for EU wide taxation that allows free public transport, in fact, the way the current administration works, there is no framework for the EU to even impose taxes
From the EU website
>The EU does not have a direct role in raising taxes or setting tax rates
It's because of Trump's support of Poland and particularly PiS, especially against Russian interests
Of course, Trump has consistently supported Russian intrrests in the past 4 years, but these people rarely use logic
So go back to the Middle East where you belong

I've driven in both cities and I think traffic is about the same
The difference comes from rush hour traffic which is much worse in general
When you're a tourist you'll generally see off peak traffic which is more orderly

Pretty much, yeah
I know it's bad, but it really was my first reaction
FREUDE
Unlike pretty much every major city on Europe, Sofia doesn't have a major river
[This here] is the most grandiose thing we have
2020 governments are really asking for bloody revolutions aren't they
The extremist governments should have had their last days in 1945
Wholesome
Can anyone explain why is the Polish govt doing this
What is the goal
I simply don’t get it
:/ Have you activated state of emergency already
Population here is concerned mostly duo to the fact that our health care is almost non existent even in peaceful times and it would easily collapse if something like Italy happens here
So a lot of people are isolating themselves
Still, our cases are growing
We've got 2 deaths, which means at least 1600 infected, ~50 confirmed now
[I still remember Trump threatening europe with terrorists] Good riddance you stupid bastard
Don't really care sadly our version of Trump is still in office
Tbh I would have preferred a Trump victory because he doesn't really care about the rest of the world as much and the USA wouldn't meddle in my countrie's already burning garbage politics
I dont know who QAnon is and honestly from that tweet I really dont wanna know
"Republican party bad
Trump is a retard but he wasn't going to get rid of NATO no matter what
At the absolute worst we'd have a repeat of the 90s UN funding crisis
Legit hope Biden is going to keep Trump's demand for NATO members to spend 2% of their GDP on defence
You know that the current Iranian government is an Islamic (shia) theocracy, right
You can't fund islamists against an islamist country
That would be like funding Al-Qaeda to fight ISIS
Try knowing Bulgarian and listening to our politicians
From uni I got to know some political PR specialists who work with the political elite and from what I understand it's an uphill battle to get them to adhere to even the most basic etiquette
Which is a problem if they meet foreign leaders
I may or may not want to share some embarrassing moments from diplomatic meetings caught on TV
It literally says right there that they were funded to fight Assad
Interesting questions, but if you mean a bunch of self-serving populists with the grace of a donkey who desperately latch onto power, then yes
Merkel calling out Bulgarian prime minister Boyko Borisov for wearing mask wrong
"We know what to do about COVID, just give us funds
Seems legit
And we embarrassed ourselves again
We are the joke of EU
This idiot is making our entire country look bad
Oh no, the man who has systematically been destroying every single good thing in the country over the past decade and even more is wearing his mask wrong
How horrific
Of course it's Boyko, he's a legendary meme icon in our country, something like Trump to americans
This is the most of Bulgaria I've seen in a while, and it's all bad
Make sense though
Our Fatman can't even get that thing correctly
That's why the country will be blowing up anyway
It's no secret that Бате Бойко isn't the smartest of individuals
Shes actually worried and he's so stupid he thinks shes just teasing
Pumpkinhead in action
resign
Yeah, seems like Bulgaria
Just wait till you see his brain
It's a pastime at this point
Nah, she usually refers to him as just 'Boyko' :D
So, visual studio Germany
Don't mind me, I am just here before the annexation
All the best from Bulgaria
Long last the Slavic Spring
I've heard on the news that Russia is considering to offer millitary help to Lukashenko
I would say that thats certainly a lot less than the euromaidan
I feel like the flag is more symbolic of hatred towards Lukashenko who has done everything to stop it from being used, rather than actual anti-russian sentiment, even if in the historical sense it most certainly was used as such
Anyways, the protests don't have a position on western integration, the sole EU flag in front of this massive demonstration shows that the pro-western sentiment isn't widespread, which, I'd argue, is a good thing, nobody wants a repeat of Ukraine
Looks like it's coming along great
We also try to make one every summer in my city ( Varna )

You can tell where the Internet propaganda machine has had succes
Its more propaganda I believe
They have been filling their heads that the UK is essential to the EU, they think that we are worried tf we going to do without them even tho most eu citizens forgot about Brexit
Tbh I think they will have no deal because Eu wants to flex so no one else would think  of leaving
If they cancel Brexit it would leave them with a cheaper pound and destroyed pride
Am I the only one who fucking hates this mark
It's ugly and it gets hairs that I have to constantly plug out
Even Europe is starting to ackowledge the situation (There was a debate in the europarliament today related to the situation in Bulgaria, 2 weeks after the hearing in LIBE, in which the chief prosecutor made a lie that he called for the meeting which he didn't even attend, debunked by LIBE themselves)
Borisov just has less and less reasons to stay and the earlier he resigns the better for himself
Love you guys; so happy I returned home this month and was able to take part in these
I hope they do lead to some good changes this time
Wow this post is really interesting because in the comments you have actual Europeans supporting the protesters and then you have salty Americans - half of the Americans are supporting peaceful protests and the other half want us to burn our city
LOL
You heard of Covid
They're not all mobsters, he said yesterday that some of them are contrabandists too
Don't feel bad
The protests in Serbia were one of the things that inspired the Bulgarian ones
So  your attitude actually helped a lot
We are accustomed to protesting for months on end every few years with questionable (unfortunately) results
He's actually resigned twice already and got reelected both times
Current polling shows him winning the next election as well (by a slim margin)
Elections are in a few months anyway
I mean, if what I'm hearing is true and big boy Boyko is trying to set his deals with the Russians so nobody can reverse them after, he has all the reasons to hold onto power
After all this is the guy who already left twice during protests
Makes you wonder what's so different this time, no
> corrupt ass oligarchy
This
They are way too incompetent to be Orban
Both, although Borisov himself isn't too keen on the nationalistic speech
But the smaller party in the ruling coalition are nationalists, so they get some favors as well
Bright side - our next elections are in March 2021
BTW nice username, Outlander
Yes, the system does need to be changed and even one government with good majority can only start to undo the actions of the mafia but not destroy it
It has dug too far into Bulgarian politics
However, I also think that the protests are very important because they show that people won't tolerate being played around
And we also can't do anything useful with the current parliament
That's why people are protesting
Boyko is not the only one the protesters want to resign
There are also the chief prosecutor, the director of BNT and most importantly, the bosses of the mafia Ahmed Dogan and Delyan Peevski
We need restart of the system but that won't happen with Boyko
We need lustration of the people responsible for the mafia during the transition and we need to start from somewhere
Yep, the EU has been calling for a specific reform since 2009 - make the Prosecutor General accountable and take away his ability to stop investigations by his subordinates
The PG's role is mostly to act as an "umbrella" that protects mafia interests from any serious investigation, or just conducts botched investigations so that they fall apart in court
He left once during protests and the reason was high electricity prices, later turning political
The second time he resigned because Rumen Radev won the presidential elections not because of protests
He had a bad candidate there
These protests are directly against the mafia, the rule of law so that's how it differs
The current government is with less than 30% (both GERB and UP included) yet he's trying to waste time with grand national assembly
You're right that he has his reasons to stay in power but we're not sure what they are exactly
He could be making last deals, could be looking for someone to replace them, find a way to make sure he isn't prosecuted
But if you think about it, if he resigned earlier he could have had bigger chances to win more trust but now that he's just driving around the country and calling protesters mafia is fully incompetent and won't turn out well for him
That's not everything
You're forgetting that he bought the europarliament too and most of the foreign media which costs quite a lot too

It's like me posting something about Saudi Arabia in r/Europe
We also have a ton of Chinese food shops and we don't post stuff about China, right
Are you dumb or something
Even if there are more Turks in Germany that does not mean that turkey is a European country
Your point has nothing to do with the subject and does not change the fact that Turkey is not a European country
But what are they opposing or what to happen
Such western superiority, wow
DAE think that easterners are stupid because they live in poverty on purpose

To be fair to the two party system, it's much less likely that the party is a bunch of yes-men for Dear Leader and there is a lot of fractures inside those parties
For example I've never seen as much disagreement as I've seen inside the Tories and Labor in regards to Brexit

Seriously, climate change denial is crossing a line
Fucked up immigration policies and threatening to ruin relationships with major political powers is bad
At the end our lives are momentary, and we'll be just another era of idiots even if we die in the process, big deal, but dooming the planet is just a dickmove, and something that obviously doesn't concern the most powerful man on Earth
Edit: Weirdly I got several replies with the exact sentiment in under five minutes, from different users as well
Yes, we are not destroying the planet, but ourselves and the flora and fauna
I agree, it's an important distinction to make
Also, from browsing some of the pro-Trump subreddits and comment sections, I see a lot of whataboutism and pointing fingers
Yes, almost every country on Earth has to improve a lot, that's the whole idea of this agreement
Also, it may not be perfect, but literary all but two countries agreed to it, before Trump decided to do what his father never could and pull out
It shows an ambition to solve *the biggest* problem humanity has ever faced, and threatening not to cooperate because it doesn't help the US economy or the "poor" American workers (not that he cares about them) is just a pisstake
We deserve it, the future generations don't.

Again, it doesn't matter what your opinion on immigrants is
It doesn't matter if you are a nationalist, a communist, liberal, conservative, isolationist or globalist
What Trump did right now goes beyond the realm of politics and responses like yours don't help anyone
I get what you're referring to but I see a horde of zombies with that light and postures
I'm form Bulgaria and I pay 15 euros for 1gbps internet
I would link my speedtest but I'm too lazy to get out of bed and go to the other room and use the Ethernet cable
On wifi I get about 450-500mbps
How much do you download with ?
I pay 5 euro for 100 mbps LOL
Wtf and that's in the capital
> If you go to some african countries with 100€ you can basically own the entire city
what are you on about
30 leva for 1gb
Which provider
A1 but I think the offer was temporary and has expired since It's no longer on their website
It's technically 40 BGN for just 1gbps internet
However if you get it with the lowest TV package which separately costs 10 BGN it's still 40 BGN total so I get the internet for 30 and the TV for 10 either way
Personally I don't watch TV but my mom wants to have TV when she comes visit and I was planning on getting some basic TV plan anyway so it's a win/win for me
Edit: Nevermind
The offer is still up, I just wasn't looking at the right place:
Looks like a bargain but I've heard some bad things about A1
I completely forgot that coverage might be an issue
I live in Sofia so I kinda don't have to worry about it since a substantial part of the city has fibre coverage
Not gonna lie
I used to have a lot of problem with them back when I was on Megalan, than Megalan was bought my M-tel and then M-tel was bought by a1 but when I switched to fibre I've had literally 0 issues which happened about a year and a half ago

We still have to make sure this doesn't pass in September
I understand that this law will help artist such as musicians to get better payment and royalties by tech giants, but this **should NOT come at the expense of free speech, sharing of information, free fan-made creation and memes
YOU DON'T TOUCH THE MEMES
They are the soul of the Internet
VI VON
I just found out about this yesterday
The news channels in my country haven't said a thing about it
But I'm gonna make sure I spread the word about it till September
I get that the whole "save the memes" thing kind of ended up backfiring, but I think the whole point of it was to show that the proposal was so ridiculously broad that it would end up effectively banning memes, or at least make posting them such a headache that most people wouldn't even bother
I mean, could you imagine having to go through a roided up version of Youtube's Content ID every single time you try to post a meme
Problem was, of course, that there are a lot of people could not give less of a shit about memes
In the future we should probably focus more on the effects it would have on social media and wikipedia, which FAR more people use and care about
Fan content in general, too
They probably just don't understand how the internet works
We know that automatic filters are really, really bad at discerning what actually constitutes copyright infringement, but if you're just an old guy who can barely send an e-mail you'd probably think "check uploaded things for copyright infringement
Sounds good to me
I don't get what these internet pirates are so worked up about
I mean, to a point I agree with you, but the entire point of a party is to say "Everyone in this group of people will push the following issues, vote for us if you're interested
Yes, of course
That was part of what I was trying to say
Obviously there are actual reasons why this could look good on paper, espacially since this contains a lot more than just articles 11 & 13
But internet culture is in many ways inherently derivative, and I don't just mean memes
I'll also openly admit I'm biased, since I generally have problems with copyright law, anyway
I'm just saying that the idea that an automated filter can accurately determine the legality of something or that a link tax would lead to increase in revenue and not the opposite can only make sense to someone who barely uses the internet
Good job neighbors, fuck 'em, send them straight to jail
This is so good to see
Greece went through a lot and it is during such times that nazism rises
I'm really happy to see the people reject it
What about not using this crude form of whataboutism
> But all this time from 1938 to 1939, until the very beginning of the  war, the USSR called on European countries to unite and prevent a  possibility of war
No one listened to them but tried to gain personal profit by entering  into alliances with the Nazis
The USSR is the last to conclude a  similar treaty
Declaration and frontier pact is a little difference than alliance
The USSR agreed to supply the Nazis with vital materials and divide Eastern Europe between the two of them
Britain and France did a lot of dumb moves at the time but nothing like that
Hitler very much wanted to ally with Britain but the Brits refused
And gee, I wonder why no one trusted Stalin
maybe because he had a penchant for stabbing "allies" in the back
Hypocritical
Can't you just have a day to hate the worst regimes that have been created
They outweigh the deaths of what capitalism has done
And even if you want a day for it this is not the place you try to get it
It's like a person advertising a funeral of someone at another person's funeral
What system would you propose to capitalism, no one says it's great, it's the best we have
I agree if we maybe switch the focus on profits to well being it will be better
Facism caused WW2, Cold war was between 2 ideologies
And I will take capitalism instead of communism any day
Imagine having not only little money but when you go to the store the shelves to be almost empty
Imagine being forced to work for free now . Imagine waiting to by TV even if you have the money
Imagine not saying jokes because you might be imprisoned, tortured and killed
We can still improve capitalism
The US system is shit, I agree but look at some other countries that have capitalism
There was a meme yesterday: nobody is allowed to go out
But when there is an earthquake what do you do
There was a thread a few days about what else could happen this year to make it worse
People said earthquakes and that mf is listening
Can you PM me if you ever think of moving to Bulgaria so I can move out
Heard your mom scream MY name last night

Can only imagine the level of education in Norway if people there would rather study in a 3rd world country like the US rather than Norway
It's a post shitting on the US while admitting that many students prefer traveling there over other places
It's a fake editted post regarding how the US is a 3rd world country that has irony in it because it basically admits that students do travel to the US(making it not so much a 3rd world country) rather than staying in Norway
Yet people still migrate in mass to the US
And fucking trailer parks, don't you guys actually have those specially designed for gypsies so they stay there and not pollute your city
Not to mention the crap state of the NHS

Ukraine at the very least knew that the rebels had access to a Buk system and didn't do anything to notify airlines flying over the war zone about this
Now it's probably speculation whether they expected or hoped something like this to happen, but at the very least there was gross negligence
Incidentally the rebels which shot down the plane though that the air space had been closed - which it had been but well below the height at which airliners usually fly
So we're experiencing a Euricane
Why would you go out with a bike in that weather
Very windy on the opposite end of Europe in Bulgaria as well
Guess it's everywhere
Urban transport

You don't go
Ofc Bulgaria
what's weird is that it's so funny but it also makes sense
Top searches in Bulgaria (in Bulgarian) currently: most of the results are "how do I sew my own mask" or "how to stay safe during COVID/grippe" and then
3rd one is "how do I know if I have magic"
7th one is "how do I make my own sanitizer"
12th one is "how do I force a period"
Top searches of all time in Bulgarian:
most of them are literally just "how do i", with nothing else added (top one is just "how") and then there's "how do I force a period", "how do I get pregnant", "how do I kiss"
Top search of all time in Bulgaria in English: how do I look
so there's that
Montenegro Greece and Albania are so accurate lol
Fake for sure
I just wanted to note how italian is Italy's search

You don't travel 20min in circles looking for a parking spot on a bad day
A tram also does not park in the underground parking lots, nor does it go to the neighbouring village or town
No, the reason people do not live in cities is because of price
If all the cities had a accessible price to get a flat, then the country side will be even more depopulated
It baffles me that these people would kill over cartoons and criticism, yet not bat an eye when some countries are basically exterminating their fellow muslims
Time will come when the Western part of europe will start to understand the Eastern part of Europe :/
I guess I'll go buy some french cheeses and wine now to show my support
Any European can do that much
sure, just dont complain about gas prices afterwards
In all likelyhood it was an ~~incident~~ accident
I very much doubt whoever was on the ground pushing the button though he was downing a flying tube with civilians
While this doesn't exhortation what happened, it's not like Russia was trying to find a way to murder Dutch people
God damn it
Bulgaria got severely lectured about building the south pipeline so we abandoned it in 2014, next thing we know Germany is approving the North one and saying we should build go back to building the south one, you know after turkey already takes the fucking deal
Just fuck off you cunts
Russophile politicians loved this move and a lot of them used it as ammunition against the EU
I'm sorry, but shit like this dwarfs Eastern European corrupt politicans
Can't think of another country that has a former PM on the board of Rosneft- so blatantly working for Russia
Will Mekel join Gazprom when she retires
Mommy where is UK going
Looks suspiciously similar to Veliko Tarnovo
Same in Bulgarian
I think it should mean something like "a good feeling". You know, like being happy and lucky at the same time
Eastern Roman Empire =/= Greece
We should cancel google for assuming genders
I wish them good luck with these protests
Remember that even if a protest doesn't succeed with its most ambitious  goals it can still change things for the better by forcing the government to tone down some of its unpopular measures or abandon future plans to make things worse
I hope they succeed
I'm tired of half the parties in my parliament being paid by Russian gas money, and caring only about what Putin and his origarch gang say, rather about what bulgarian people say
How nice would it be if one of these days Russia wakes up as a real democracy and works together with Europe on the big challenges of today, like climate, equality etc
He's a politician and a KGB agent, maybe he
lied
Bulgaria and Serbia support this protest
We're doing the same thing now and we shouldn't stop until we win the fight
Let's count them, protests in Bulgaria, Hungary, Serbia, where else in the eu are there protests
Be strong brothers and sisters
Much love from Bulgaria
Next elections don't fuck up please
The most corrupted in EU
Hold my yogurt
It's 16th consecutive day we've been protesting here, we want the current political part, along with the prosecutor and prime minister gone, what about you
If the system is rigged then heads will have to roll
It's exactly the same in here
The ruling party since 2009 is considered right leaning on paper with the convenient name of "Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria", but in reality it's everything else but this

It's always been interesting to me how we trade some sharp words or expel Russian diplomats or something every couple of years for one reason or another, yet relations never deteriorate beyond that
Obviously a good thing, but it seems different to other countries in the region
I wonder why those nations don't like Russia
HOW THERE THEY

What are bad relations supposed to look like
Russia will sell us the most expensive gas, try to conduct assassinations and destroy businesses, infiltrate the state and media, insult and belittle us
They already do all that
Bombing of Yugoslavia
Russians saw it as the western powers ignoring it completely when deciding how to handle the situation, circumventing the UN security council and using NATO as an aggressive alliance
Ever since then they have been mistrustful of both America and its European allies
I mean back then it was the logical choice
Russia was a humiliated and ruined great power
Who could have thought they'd come back so fast and be so malicious
Yes, but by their perspective you have been much more of a friend to them than us in EU/NATO
I don't follow

Serbia has been much more of a friend to Russia in the last 100 years than us or the Baltic states

Most people tend to visit Greece & Turkey because of said facts
Fun fact: This summer Greece made it mandatory to have a PCR test to enter there and there was kilometers of cars waiting at the Greek border, but not trying to visit our seaside (even though a PCR test costs ~€60 here)
I really hope they improve on these things in next year, because we could have much better tourism than now

This depicts my feelings towards monkeydonia very accurately
Lmao sorry North Macedonia idk what came over me
Hahaa this about Macedonia and Bulgaria is true
I don't want them to be a country, because they only steal from other countries
And that's why I want them to be part of BULGARIA
Bulgaria and Macedonia are the same nation (at lest some years ago) so I don't think that they should fight each other
What a beauty of a subreddit
I mean
There's one place where a Slavic state has invaded another right now, and it's not the Balkans
The most the Balkans states do to each other these days is shit-talk
I mean we can live in the Balkans and not kill each other
The hottest dispute rn is Bulgaria vs North Macedonia and we haven't killed each other much since WW2
Actually it's not
The Balkans were fairly peaceful when the term was coined

As a Bulgarian I feel pretty embarrassed by our role in this one
Our prime minister - whom we have been protesting against for 2 weeks now - is bragging all around how we got more money than last time even though the overall budget is lower
I can assure you that if nothing changes here, most of these funds will not be spent transparently but instead sink into a circle of businesses close to the government
It also feels pretty undeserved getting this money in view of the state of the rule of law here, which is virtually non-existent
So it feels like we're like some kind of happy beggars, graced by the undeserved kindness of rich EU nations
Edit: I do appreciate the fact that EU leaders have been able to reach an agreement, though, it felt like a pretty tough fight
I have lived through all Bulgarian governments since communist regime, and current one is actually the least harmful one
No wonder people repeatedly vote for it in the last 10 years
Despite some scandals, there were many improvements in infrastructure and also we are one of the countries in EU with the least debt (  - at least they are not taking debt to loot it, so I hope the majority of the new grants will be used again for infrastructure, energy efficiency (a lot of apartment buildings were insulated with government aid in recent years)
I would not be surprised that despite protests, majority of voters will again vote for Borisov to avoid risk of getting someone way worse again
I am excited to see young people on protests trying to improve our country
But we 40-year olds have to take care of so many things (children, old parents, etc, expenses) that we are just happy to have some stability (and not having banks fail)
Couldn't have worded it better
Edit: I forgot how to properly write in English
Not only that, my unicorn friend, but the money sinking into mafia pockets will actually make things worse here
The oligarchy will just become more powerful and entrenched
We are still the poorest country in the EU, the runt, the laughing stock of the whole union and this guy is bragging as if he won a football match
With actually competent leaders we could be so much better after 13 years of membership
Yeah, someone has to be the poorest, and it was probably always going to be us, the quality of life and healthcare could have been so much better
But hey, our guy builds highways, eh
Highways so good the asphalt probably won't last a decade
We definitely don't deserve the money because they'd just go into the pockets of oligarchs
Personally I wouldn't mind EU sanctions if there are misuses of funds in Bulgaria, and there sure as hell are
I emphatically and vehemently disagree with such attitude
Firstly, the 1997-2001 government, corrupt as it was, brought the country of deep crisis, made economic reforms which in spite of flawed privatization led to a decade of unprecedented GDP and income growth, opened the road to EU membership, switched the currency and monetary mechanisms which guaranteed currency and banking system stability, built (I believe, need to check) more highways than Borisov during any of his mandates, without any comparable EU funding and without bragging and holding ceremonies for newly completed every 10 km
Also, that government, corrupt as it was, was **IN NO FUCKING WAY** nearly as corrupt as the current one
No private business was taken away and gifted to friendly oligarchs, unlike the lottery and the "Eight Dwarfs" recent affair
The Chief Public Prosecutor wasn't essentially a player on the government's team who could be used against any opposition or businessman that the government doesn't like
I don't think media has been controlled by the government and its friendly oligarchs since the end of communism
What we have now is not stability, it is a slow but steady decay and desintegration of the state
Today they are hitting large and middle businesses, tomorrow it may well be you and me, unless you're on friendly terms with someone in power
If this government doesn't go away, or if GERB get reelected, most of the young people supporting the protests right now are going to leave the country and not come back
Ok fair point, in my language the word that translates as 'brag' doesn't mean that what one claims about himself is not true, if that's the case with English, I should have used another word
Maybe 'boasting'?
Which is why we are trying to ги изринем.
Which is also why it seems to me that if the current protests don't reach their goals, most of the younger participants in them will not be staying here much longer
Maybe Kostov and some other early Prime ministers did well, but the situation left after communism was just too bad
You could be right about that
Media like [Capital
bg] and [Dnevnik
bg] are against government
BTV is owned by a foreign company
And I see all the bad things about the government on most Bulgarian media (like apartamentgate, etc) so I do not think media is oppressed
I watched the "Eight Dwarfs" last week
If it is true it is indeed extremely bad
And I would support prosecuting all involved and Geshev should resign in this case
Unfortunately only proof was the story of this businessman and I do not believe him 100%. His actions are not very logical
He constantly agrees to sign ANYTHING he is given by the corrupt prosecutor like a moron (if he were such moron how he made such a big business)
And why did not he take his family feud to court and instead went to the mafia
Could he be the bad guy and not his family as he claims
I liked how Geshev started to prosecute several rich oligarchs (something unseen till now)
Could this be in fact just a plot to take these businesses from the owners and give them to Geshev's own friends
Yes it is possible, but I do not know for now
We need to see what happens to these businesses after their owners are stripped of them
Actually instead of giving the Bozhkov's multimillion gambling business to someone else, GERB and Patriots voted a law that forbids private gambling (BSP voted against
What a surprise - if they were really the mafia (as protesters claim) why dissolve such a lucrative business instead of stealing it
And Geshev's efforts were in vain - what a pity :)
What  bothers me is that all this activity - Dwarves, Rosenec, Borisov room photos - happened exactly when Bozhkov was charged
It almost looks like he organized all these things
I do not know what is actually true and cannot form an opinion at the moment
When we do know I am all for wrong doers to go to prison
Even if Geshev is organizing all these bad things, I still do not understand why the government should also resign - what did Borisov do wrong
(phone and photo compromats could be fabricated)
Elections are in 7 months
Why should Radev/BSP rule for 3 months
They always do a lot of harm to Bulgaria
What about the rights of all those people who voted for GERB + United Patriots
4 million people voted for them
Now several thousand protest and government should resign
Democracy means that majority rule
If 1
4 million come to the streets to protest, then  the situation will be quite different and resignation should be immediate
Otherwise why bother to go and vote in elections if later 10 000 people can demand resignations and change the government as they wish
To be fully honest, I am ashamed by some of the things Borisov says from time to time
But I think he is not a bad person and actually wants to improve Bulgaria
Yup, if we don't turn the trend into a positive one, I'll probably leave in 2021
currently this is no place to run a business or have children
How did they give us more money when the overall budget is smaller
Well I guess it's EU solidarity at play
Bulgaria is the least developed and needy nation, and also it's a pretty small economy
The increase is only 1 billion euro which is by no means tremendous as compared to the entire deal
But it's a fact that it's there
Misleading - what about the offshore territories

That's such a shallow view of how a democracy as large as the EU operates
Firstly, if the average voter doesn't understand how the system they participate in works, the problem isn't with your average voter, but with the system you have in place
It's not a matter of education or political engagement, it's a matter of complexity level
Secondly, that's a matter of "is" vs "ought". EU citizens don't understand how the EU operates
You say they ought to understand
The first part of that statement is a fact, the second part is just wishful thinking
Those are two very different things
You can't sit around, arguing that the problem is that people "don't understand". Newsflash—no matter the importance of "people understanding" is, no matter their responsibility, in the foreseeable future voters won't begin to understand how the EU operates
You better accept that, and don't vote stupid regulations that alienate EU citizens from the institutions of the European Union
TL;DR: Your comment is how you create EU skeptics
Yeah, there isn't exactly a whole lot of copy right protection down here
Pretty much everyone I've ever met has pirated things

> Same thing happens in every country, but sure
Jesus fucking Christ, would you stop repeating that already
It is simply *not true*. It doesn't happen in every country, and even when it happens, it is nowhere near the astronomical scale it happens in the EU
Not to mention that *even if it happened* everywhere else, your argument boils down to pure whataboutism
News flash—the system is broken elsewhere as well
Gee, thanks, I didn't know
We DON'T need a broken record telling us that
That is ***NO EXCUSE*** for what just happened today
And even with the system broken elsewhere, people can exert much more control over their national governments than over whatever this voluptuous, amorphic beast the EU has become
What a myopic shit propaganda regurgitator you are
> But it's still not the EUs faut
No matter how many people think that, no matter the reason
Yet you fail to provide an argument to backup your claim
The truth is, EU is not just "an international framework", as you claim it to be in your other comments
It is very much what the average voter perceives it to be, and currently voters perceive it to be a corrupt lobbyist machine, incapable of solving any real issues
To put it in other words, the EU is precisely what "many people think" it to be
> And I'm doing my part to explain how it isn't.
No, you're not
You are going around telling people they are wrong, and that they shouldn't be mad at the EU for one of the worst decisions the EU has ever made
That is how you create euroskeptics
And, listen, even if we agree the EU is nothing but a framework which corrupt politicians exploit, none of that would have been possible without that framework
It is that framework that enables directives such as this one to be passed; that framework that relegates too much national sovereignty into the hands of a corrupt few
The corrupt politicians aren't the disease, but the symptoms
And believe me when I tell you, as an Eastern European, they aren't the only symptom
The EU needs to change, and needs to change *fast*.
What part of "but what about other countries that use a similar system" isn't pure whataboutism
> One simple analogy: The Bulgarian state passes a shitty law
Who do you blame
> The state of Bulgaria
Or the politicians
Over the last 30 years all kinds of shitty laws have been passed in Bulgaria
Politicians of all walks of life and all ends of the political spectrum have enacted 'shitty regulations' of all kinds
Plain and simple, it is obvious the system allows for corrupt politicans to exist
You might cut out the weeds, but the root of the problem is the system which allows for corruption to exist
I blame the state
Bear in mind, I am no delusional revolutionary who just wants to tear down systems and revel in the ensuing chaos
I don't want to *tear down* the EU, I want to *change* it
And I want drastic, sweeping changes, but none of the changes I desire would serve to undermine the basic principle of the EU—that is, an union of States with one common market, freedom of movement, and an unified European idea
But if I had to decide right now between 20 more years with the same "EU framework" that you talk about, and the dissolution of the EU, I'd chose the later
Corrupt politicians have allowed the EU to become an absolute disgrace, and today the "union" reached the lowest point in its history
You are hopelessly brainwashed, aren't you
The choice between a lesser evil and no evil must always be the no evil
If people say they "want" reforms, but prefer what they currently have over nothing, then nothing will change
If they prefer nothing over the EU, then the EU will change
Amazing

Masks are obligatory and very widely worn in the Metro, trams, busses or other public transport

Bulgaria always the strongest
Why does everyone think it has anything to do with religion
People against same sex marriage are a lot more than people who are actually religious
But that might be the case only here, I don't know
Communists were surprisingly discriminatory for people who supposedly wanted the ultimate form of equality
Oh yeah, sorry, the government was appointed by blatant election fraud supported by the EU
That better
Balanced is not misused at all
Balanced doesn't mean good, you're applying your own biases to the word
[51% of Bulgarians identify as religious, the least in the Balkans
] (
[39% support equal gay rights, 93% of parents will be outraged if their child has a same sex partner]
It sure has same effect, but it is not the one and only cause, like people make it to be
I don't know many deeply religious peoples in my country but the few that I know are very involved with various kind of charities, community organizations, nature preserving and non have denied science or hold really conservative values
I know many are not like that but just calling them stupid or unstable is quite unfair
Even if they are they are probably still doing a lot more than most people, me (non-religious) and maybe even you
So maybe understand that there are nuances in this world
Couldn't care less

I think your attempt failed so not that it's too soon - just not funny
I think it's more that the European people (and American) have failed Ukraine (to which they obviously have no obligations)
The EU can't do much when besieged by other crises and when people don't want confrontation with Russia in the interest of "stability".
If there were big protests everywhere in solidarity with Ukraine and calls for the governments to do something, more would have been done
Of course no one should be blamed that this didn't happen
That's too much, but it would have been nice if it happened

Although Bulgaria is having a nuclear power plant, it still produces ~50% of it's energy from coal, why ?
So we're the only EU country where coal has grown over this period
Damn
IIRC We screwed ourselves over with the contracts with the fossil plants
We basically can't touch them until they start to be up for renewal in like 2025
This is screwing the rest because we can't shut them down and we only consume a finite amount of power
Hell we have excess to sell

Italy wtf man you literally fought on the nazi side how do you not remember
How do you deny the whole thing happened
We have tons of pictures and documents from the time, countless witness testimonies, including people that were in the camps and are still alive, mass graves, the buildings
It was documented by both the Germans and the invading Russian and American armies
Neither of those governments denies the Holocaust (unlike i.e. the Armenian genocide)
What more proof does a denier need, a time machine
I can understand someone denying the magnitude, or the reasoning behind the whole thing or whatever other aspect of the Holocaust due to antisemitic beliefs, but deny the whole thing even happened
That's even weirder than the "moon landing was fake" conspiracy
>Another example that always fascinates me is the perception in France of  who helped the most in ending the war during WWII
That's a very disappointing data set
The first poll is in 1945 when literally half of the French population is supporting some kind of socialism but the second is in 1994, after the USSR itself had collapsed
It would be incredibly interesting to see how it changed during the Cold War, especially in such key moments like 1968 and the 80s when the French socialist party adapted more "right-wing" economic policies
Coming from the other side of the iron curtain, I remember my father complaining how before 1989 he war was presented as almost 100% Soviet effort with no mention of things like the North African campaign and the war in the far east

I learned on QI that death of cyclists went up after the invention of th seatbelt
People who feel safe in their cars with their ABS, seatbelts and other safeties drive more recklessly
Death tolls on the roads were decreasing until the mid 1980s.

We people are selfish and stupid like that
Peaceful protests are boring and that's the truth
Well I just went on youtube and everything that is from Bach is playable so I don't know what you're talking about
In Bulgaria at least it wasn't allowed to build churches higher than an ottoman soldier on a horse
So they built them 70% underground with only the top and entrance at ground level
So these churches are real, and while I cannot be 100% sure about the rule, but I also don't see any other reason for the weird churches

One of my biggest gripes with Bulgarian politics is that there is no individual will amongst the MPs
Each one votes for what they've been told to vote for
Basically it's like having a dictator in charge

ok, this thing won't go our way without violence

I felt the urge to just say that not all 7 million of us are part of these protests (in fact is a very small percentage of the population) that do
I'm not saying there's no corruption, and we shouldn't express our *rights* in the democratic process - but that these protests began after a legitimate investigation concerning our president having classified documents in his posesion - while not having the respective military clearance
He WAS a military general, but is now a president (and out presidency is nothing like USA's) There really are *many* layers to what's currently happening, which are buried under the simple "they corrupt - we protest"
Setiha se nai setne
You wish, ha
Seriously, most of the people are actually 20-25 yr old, so they have been living in the EU most of their conscious life
It is EU values such as democracy, freedom and rule of law that have led them to rebel now
So the protesting crowd (by far the larger part of it) represents the most pro-EU constituency here
I remember you recently had some pro-choice protests which were among the most inspiring protests in Europe I remember from recent years
This is where Lucio boops you off the map
Dude I feel like this was the longest winter ever
The restrictions added a lot of "winter" to the winter if you know what I mean
EU's efforts are wasted on Serbia tbh
Funny how China comes in, gives no aid, provides some small (relatively to European ones) investments that are also predatory and gets 10 times more goodwill from that
BEtter present some fucking proof for this
Because Serbia has ridiculously new and quality infrastructure her EU members don't have
Smells like bullshit EU propaganda
> This hypocrisy and ungratefulness is actually generated from the top
This is one of their president's tantrums against the EU
Totally
It's crazy how Vucic  marketed himself as pro-EU to Serbs and foreigners  when he doesn't act the part
In recent years he even received a sort of order of friendship from Putin
Looking at what Putin does to countries that try to join  the EU I can't imagine he'd be giving orders of friendship to a guy that's helping Serbia join it
Serbia is part of China's "Belt and Road" initiative, and CCP are exploiting that fact to the max
Few counties dare to speak about faulty testing kits, fake N95, medical equipment with quality of toilet paper, or the fact that the "free" donations from China have to be actually purchased (plus signing political deals with China)
Great for our neighbor Serbia, my country (Bulgaria) is next
> This image is comparing apples to oranges
It's comparing what people see as foreign investments ("aid") to actual aid in economic terms
Investment is not aid
It's a way of making money
And the EU has invested many times more than just 1
8 billion in Serbia
Yeah, that's more or less it
It sucks though because it's not   objective, cause it's widespread and because it's not some harmless little myth but something big that actually affects important political decisions and ends up hurting our chances at prosperity
> It is not that simple, friendly connection of Serbia with China (and with African countries if that matters) is older than EU, and Serbia does get at least some international support from China
Serbians do have positive feelings about Chinese
so what
Aren't there other countries you have long diplomatic relations with
India, Morocco, Argentina, etc
I'm sure there must be some but that doesn't automatically make you relations better does it
In Bulgaria I've heard the Chinese investment promoters say the same: we have long diplomatic relations, everyday people in China totally know about Bulgaria and like it very much, blah blah
They're just making up stuff to hype their "investments". And saying general nice stuff because that's what diplomats do
Google Obama saying country X "punches above its weight". Same shit from China but worse
>the only difference with China is that China is more transpatent about their expectations
China is the last country to be transparent with something
Is it not enough they're pretending to be doing anyone a favour with their investments that are actually loans paid to Chinese companies
People don't seem to realise how great of a business this is for China
Imagine you had a rich friend that loaned you 10k euros
But you had to return them with interest
And you were only allowed to spend the money for buying things in your friend's supermarket
So you friend gets the money back immediately
and then again when you return the loan
And if you didn't repay the sum you friend  got your car as collateral
That's what  China is doing
It's making crazy money from its loans
It's basically a social program for Chinese workers and companies that someone else pays for
China is not the one doing you a favour by investing in you with such  terms, if anything China owes YOU for giving it such nice opportunities
I'm sure Western governments would love to do the  same things as China but let's face it if they tried everyone would criticise it as neocolonialism
>Additionally, event if that is all free money it is not even close to amount Serbia lost and is losing on the actions of EU
Like amount of educated people that left
C'mon as if it's EU's fault for letting Serbs immigrate to it
What is it supposed to do, ruin itself to the point no one would want to move there
That's not just in Serbia
If you want to solve this issue make better EU rules and enforcement
We are all eagerly watching the new EU prosecutor
Did Mongolia pay for the project
If not then it's aid, just less ethical or effective as aid might be if you let Mongolia do the project itself
Of course  that's not perfect either as corrupt countries may simply pocket the money without doing the project properly
That's aid then, no
If you had sent them physical goods like food (not that they need it) or medical equipment wouldn't that be aid
You just sent them lamp post aid
Don't get me wrong, it's somewhat unethical and it is sorta similar to questionable Chinese investments (except China makes you pay for having their companies work in your country), but it's still  aid by definition
Could be better aid
Vittu
Can confirm, this is Switzerland - you can tell by the non-elevated boardwalks, the wood houses everywhere and the lack of level ground anywhere
Also, mountains
That is 53 year old Mark Rutte
Our defense minister at 53

Wait, what
I've literally been to Venice and didn't even know it was an island until now
I've been there
Venezia is insane
> It seems like you can't really achieve change just by peacefully protesting and letting yourself be beaten
No, if the dictatorship is too confident and powerful it can withstand civil unrest without giving an inch
The only peaceful way to end such a regime is by somehow convincing the majority of people to strike
The violent ways are quite a few but ughh
yeah I am not going to encourage people to do that shit from behind the computer screen lmao
Defensive organizations like NATO, or economic ones like the EU are the future
If we work together, we are quite a lot stronger
Oh happy day from one union to another
I remember the millitary bases with US trucks and equipment in my small town village with goats and farmers as a kid
And of course the "intruders will be shot on sight" signs
only in English
Screw NATO , screw the Russians , screw Europe
All we got from this was brain drain and importing shitty food from Greece the same of which we grow ourselves far better in quality but send to Germany
Do you really think anyone would give a shit about Georgia if it meant a world war
no its based
Defensive as in like I've explained this over 3 times now
Those conflicts are too fucking complicated to boil it down as simply
I particularly disagree with the Yugo one
As the serbians were operating concentration camps, committing an impressive amount of war crimes to croats, bosniaks and the such
They were also murdering the peace keeping forces of the UN
I condemn the bombings, they were absolutely unacceptable, but so was the Serbian conduct
This is war mate
It's a grey middle
There is no good or bad side
All we can hope for is that a conflict like that doesn't happen ever again
Disregarding a few diplomatic blunders and the convoluted administration, the EU is quite good
I'm happy with it
The EU makes Europe a very strong power in international affairs, be it economic ones, political ones or social ones
Yeah you are right
> we literally give away billions of Euros each year to EU
Even without it being a requirement though your government already gives a lot more  to international aid   than to the EU budget
You don't notice that cause you've decided to do it but it puts into perspective that EU contributions really aren't that big
Plus since you're connected to the EU economies you support you also benefit from your own transfers to them, not so much  from international ones
Most importantly though the benefits of the Single Market for everyone are much bigger than EU budget contributions
[The UK has already lost more money from Brexit than its cumulative multi-decade EU contributions  ] and the whole thing has barely even started
Bulgaria was hit quite hard by refugees trying to go for Western Europe
But financial support and stability is the point of the EU
To make every participant strong, for the greater good
To forget pity personal conflicts
To make sure that, what we take now is given back to you in the future
To me, the EU having power over Bulgarian laws is actually beneficial, as Bulgaria being a post socialist "Republic" has incredible problems with administration and law making processes
Problems not fixed after 30 years because of the disgustingly corrupt government
However, I completely understand you not wanting to spend your money in a developing country as such
Ultimately, it's better for us all, but you have your own arguments and I can't say anything to that
>International aid and EU member fee is not the samething, at least it shouldn't be
No but I don't see why you're okay with paying international aid for others (one of the most generous countries for that) but then not smaller aid for Europeans, where additionally lots of  your money gets back to you
In Bulgaria  it's sometimes Austrian companies that renovate public spaces, Spanish ones build roads, French ones supply machines for factories, German ones build the metro, etc
And when we get richer, thanks in part to EU funds, we get to consume a lot more Western goods, stimulating their economies again
I can understand if you wish to be in the EU but not pay anything to other members
But exiting the EU because it costs money would  be a poor financial choice
You get a lot of benefits from trade aswell
International affairs are a lot more complicated than that
By being in the EU, Sweden gains a lot more from other countries
For example, Britain has lost more money in revenue since Brexit, than what it had spent on Europe in all it's years on the EU
You can't only get benefits
What ends up happening is that by everyone spending relatively little, they get a lot more back over time
And this is just the economic side on a very basic level
Point is, the EU gives europeans power and influence, while helping literally everyone in a way
I always liked to say kill one bullet with two rabbits due to how well it rhymed (or flowed I guess) in Bulgarian
Why is NE Bulgaria always depicted as speaking turkish on these maps
Don't get me wrong, there's a big Turkish minority here, but *I am from the region,* I can assure you the Turkish language is still not the majority language, and that's by an absolutely astonishingly huge margin
Patriarchs, Proletars, Oligarchs
On the 2nd of January 2021, I definitely see something like this, especially if they leave with no FTA negotiated
The real exit is actually at the end of the transition period which ends on 31
2020
From February 1st until then nothing really changes for the UK
We'll be glad to have you back
Much love
Because the British Parliament is a disnfunctional mess, that's why
The EU isn't going anywhere
They can keep blaming it just as easily as before
It's not like facts and truth are suddenly going to become important
It will count
Wtf is Brazil doing there lmao
Really
You are allowed to keep the pound instead of the euro and London was built to be the financial heart of the EU
The UK isn’t leaving because it didn’t get its way, the UK is leaving because it didn’t get its way all the time
Why not
Cologne is unnnatural to me (I didn't even know Cologne and Koln were the same until a year ago), and I don't have a way of adding umlaut on my keyboard

Oh don't say that
Remember, there were times when Europe was pretty fascist as well
Yeah, no, I'd rather take some obscenely large pickup trucks than US food
Only if USA accept to rewrite their constitution in order for EU to appoint them a King/Queen on rotation principle form the EU country members
I think it is proportionate and fair
How bout no
Just 1 chicken
We can do that, right
Fuck no
It's OK
Bulgarians gonna eat them anyway
It's so great to see things like this
Gives me hope that European cities can maintain and even restore their beautiful architectural heritage
Death to monarchy
Poland feeling very nostalgic for those communist days
Isn't it the same here in Bulgaria
All major media owned by a single person (Peevski) and serving the ruling party (Borisov)
Also [this kind of stuff]
You forgot "You, bloody, damned commie
Uhm, just look at those headlines
This is their national broadcaster
BNT looks like a model of fair agendaless media compared to that
But yes our situation isn't rosy and it's going to get worse if we don't do something about it

Wow beautiful
Вечна памет, thank you for taking us among the stars
And Bulgaria
If you ask our ruling party and the majority of their voters, this ranking and especially our glorious 111th position is a fabrication of the West because they hate Bulgaria and are jealous of the progress we've had
I'm not kidding, our press is *that bad*. Some people genuinenly believe that
haha, Boyko is the boss
and some say he is pushing for europe, democracy and other trendy words
oh no what have we done again
Damn
rip bulgarian press freedom
BRUH
Government-connected oligarchs bought most of the major media in Bulgaria in the last few years and installed puppets in the government owned media, who fired a lot of the good journalists that were working there
And it seems all major parties are in the same boat
It will be very hard to change something here, and it is getting harder every day
Press freedom in Bulgaria is probably going to become even worse in the near future
And yes, there are big protests here against corruption and oligarchy
We can still hope, at least
Well
Fuck
Nice
Е браво бе
Interesting but how do you measure that
Yup
It's fine, this ranking barely gets a mention in the mainstream media
Only the "untrustworthy, oligarch-owned media that aims to totally discredit our glorious government and the wonderful progress of Bulgaria" talk about this placement
Yup, things are that bad
Part of why tens of thousands of us are in the streets everyday
In spite of the pandemic
Yes, sadly
I hope this explains it a little better why so many Bulgarians are protesting every day all over the country
Wanna upvote you but you have 111 points right now and I find that to be very, very appropriate
Yeaaaah, you are talking out of your ass
> The possibility of criminalizing “insulting the state or its leaders” is again being discussed at high levels
every commie dream
true story
Really
[Here] is how the most watched media tries to discredit RSF
For people not speaking Bulgarian - RSF says in their report about Bulgaria that critical media is often under attack by the state and is discredited by judicial system and faces constant pressure such as asset freezing
In an attempt to save face, the video shows our pro-government media's (the most watched one) "response" to those claims - that this judicial attacks are due to "money laundering allegations" and bullshit like that
Allegations that never made it to court by the way
Because they are a complete fabrication
geshev fabricates evidence
boyko pays people to act stupid so that will spark the fire of protesters being not peaceful and they can unleash fury on them
2 guys got the brutal police beating that no one is talking about
I'm pretty sure if it wasn't for the people and cameras yesterday, those other 2 guys would have been kidnapped and beaten
Boyko is in mafia mode
I don't know if we are winning by being dumb slaves or not
Power from the mafia is taken only by blood
In my eyes Boyko declared war 2 times so far + those cops should be dead by now
Today, protest again
every day more epic than the last
like osman oktay said they will do anything to spark riots as excuse to lock everyone, shut down the country, no protest
they tried the ethnical approach
they will try more very soon
There were a few front-page posts from the protests im the last few days
Maybe you've missed them if you don't browse this sub daily
> majority of their voters, this ranking and especially our glorious 111th position is a fabrication of the West because they hate Bulgaria and are jealous of the progress we've had
This part is pure bullshit
Everyone knows about our press freedom and no one belives that shit
[Here is a comment thread from reddit from the last time this was posted
] Not everyone believes that but you can see a few Bulgarian redditors essentially claiming that we should be placed much higher and questioning the ranking
You can find similar comments every time this ranking is posted
Search for yourself if you don't believe me - this ranking has been posted many times
Mongolia
Lies
We are able to visit Mongolia any time we want since we are stronk mongols
Yeah so what's so special some boats on the canal there
For some reason I am reminded of
Uk wants to go on trading with EU as it is now
But does not want to: - be subjected to the same rules, standards and Regulations as the rest of EU, to be under the European Court of justice, to let other EU nationals to move freely on UK, to pay contributions ot EU
Basically, UK wants to eat the cake, every day, and EU to send 27 more cakes, every day
Interestingly, in Bulgaria we also use them for that
I have doubts about the Balkans where it’s says the average is around 30
Many people are just registered at there parents home, some even quite a few years, after they have bought their own
I rent a small apartment with my gf, but we are both registered at our respective parents homes
Moved out at 29
Shit I hate being an average Bulgarian
Might have something to do with money
That is perhaps the only kind of lie in the media I can forgive
Props to the Ukranian government and to Babchenko
Dude's got balls
Can you imagine how happy she would be to see him again though
Why should anyone care about Russian propaganda ammo
You think they've run out of lies to need any ammo
If anyone is so naive to think Russia should be trusted after this well they are lost anyways
Not to mention that the plot was real anyways
Once again bordering Serbia, guess some things never change
Sweden neighboring Turkey would be all sorts of hilarious btw
Hey, we're now westerners with the Serbians

This is one of those combinations like a bear with chainsaws for arms

Nope, no metals
The only thing we have is a bit of copper and very little gold
Nothing else
Lots of forests though
"Chief, should we attack with the fleet or the cavalry
"Yes"
Wait a sec, where is Republic of North Macedonia
I mean we joined
I mean given how fast Bulgaria and Romania got out of the post commie hole after joining the EU it might be mutually beneficial
We're holding the door
Romani culture is very opposed to integration, the communists tried so hard and failed
I imagine it'd be very hard to integrate them without some very

Bucharest standing out
Yeap, keep Sofia in the Southwest region in Bulgaria, so it can look poor and suck dry all the EU funds
Policymaking level 9999
We are becoming a city state
Color me red
Harsh
Another pointless statistic that tells us what we already know: Eastern Europe is poor - Western Europe rules
Lol
Eastern Europe be like: "Yeah, we poor, keep scrolling "
Meh, Sofia should be yellow maybe
It makes up 40% of our country's GDP, but our GDP is really pathethic compared to the rest of the EU
Obviously a lot of people notice that the map is extremely inaccurate but why does no one give a single fuck about Thrace

Problem with Denmark entering the public view now is that all these rightwing monsters around the world are going to try and ruin it
Gotta admit it's funny, tho
Your country is g(e)orgeous !!!
Bro imagine brexiting so hard you leave the mainland
Doggerland rise
It's crazy to think this happened in the 90s and so geographically close
I watched the BBC documentary someone linked and it almost made me cry
Rest in peace
Sometimes I think I live in an alternative reality
Absolutely deranged people here have this idea that some mystical Nazis are out to get them, whining about upvotes, how this sub is right-wing, etc all the while each of their retarded post gets upvoted in the hundreds
These people on the streets, as well
They blame the Nazis for their problem while their entire country is going to shit
Where did it all go so wrong
We live in a society where Left is right, right is left
Up is down and down is up
Your country is going to shit
Closing your eyes won't change that
The process is subtle, but in the end it is absolute
You might feel safe when trucks steamroll through pedestrians, but ordinary, normal people don't. Some people say liberalism is a disease and honestly, at this point I agree
You people are not right in the head
You live in your own deranged, messed up world
Saying I live in a bubble is rich coming from you people
You've had 15 terrorist attacks just in the past 3 years, man
Who are you trying to fool that everything in your country is rosy and daisy
People are not voting for AfD because they're cool, they're voting for them because you do indeed have problems that need urgent solving
I have never even visited Breitbart, I visited Stormfront once or twice as a curiosity and if you mean "ATTACK" (a Bulgarian party of imbeciles), they're communists
Learn from your history
That is the most valuable lesson I can give you
You're going down the Weimar path and I assume you know what happened at the end of it
Homosexuality as in marriage or cohabitation is NOT legal in Bulgaria
1968 is the year the current and currently very outdated Penal code was introduced
This probably takes the lack of crimiminalisation laws to mean legalisation, which it's not
I specifically avoid saying "decriminalisation", because that mean that means that the powers that be decided something was no longer a crime
In this case there was no such sentiment
The thought process was - homosexuality was a crime that happened in  the capitalist burgueouase and in the glorious Communist state it doesn't happen, so it shouldn't be punished
Καλημέρα
Hell yeah
Beautiful eyes on the right
In other news [Turkey will freeze new government investments
I guess Erdogan personally wants to oversee the fund to make sure no one is making investments with it
He'll keep it safe
Unparalleled efficiency
What's not to worship
Yes it's worth  $90 billion
You could've titled it Bulgaria and I wouldn't even question it
Seen the same rooms here
I'm glad this is not a thing
It would've been really disturbing sub
Oh so you think 16% is low
Bulgaria's is 10% and has a health system and roads to match
Taxation has nothing to do with what our hospitals and roads look like
If anything because of the rampant corruption and amazing incompetency  a low taxation level is preferred
A person is more efficient at distributing his income than any central authority and can better match his needs than any government can predict or react to changes in that preference
Would you prefer to have a 40% tax
Imagine getting 1000 lev and only seeing 600 of it, but not only do you have less money, everything is more expensive now, cause corporate tax is higher, that means you have less money,higher bills and higher prices
Yeah sounds amazing
Bulgaria does not need more money, we are running a surplus,we need to actually spend more, borrow more and stimulate our economy
Increase of efficiency of using our current funds and increase efficiency in most government run sectors
Right now we have an inflated police force and jobs that should need one person,done by five
Just look at most university staff
Employees everywhere yet no one is doing their job or wants to work, might as well not have them
Increase the digitization of our bureaucracy,make it so you can due most things online
As  person who has lived in a high tax society I'm telling you, not only is it inefficient, it's frustrating and leaves you always wanting more
>I assume the government uses Bulgaria as a positive example
What a time to be alive
Yeah, places like the Cotswolds are really beautiful, more so than London even
If online games with loot boxes have taught me anything about life it's that the market will never self regulate itself
The supplier will try more and more questionable ways to squeeze money out of the buyer and the buyer will still buy like a sheep
Weird that we even have any
If I remember correctly it's forbidden to shoot porn in Bulgaria
I think porn itself is banned
It's just that no one tries to enforce the law
I wish that was the only problem
In a lot of cases both women and men are pressured to do things they initially didn't agree on
For example women are coerced into shooting much more aggressive fims, than they are willing to
Men are told they have to do one gay porn film so they go on to women, but then they only do gay porn
In addition human trafficking is also a huge problem in those countries, and many of those "porn stars" are actually victims of trafficking which were promised jobs as waitresses and what not, but had their documents taken away and now they can't leave
The EU won't want any exemptions probably, Scotland would need to join Schengen and accept the euro
Catalonia can't join
All members need to agree to someone joining, and you can see that Spain won't be best pals with Catalonia and they would most likely say no
That's why Macedonia changed its name again, so they can pleasure Greece and they wouldn't stop them from joining the EU
Macedonia also signed a friendship treaty with Bulgaria so Bulgaria helped them with Greece
They had to rewrite their history according to how Bulgaria views it
Catalonia would flat out be refused by Spain
BUT THE ECONOMY
"Due to unforeseen difficulties, the Genghis Khan exhibit will be replaced with Winnie the Pooh exhibit
Yeah, it really bugs me when people cite the Wikipedia figures for people killed by the Mongols as if they are gospel truth
Historians are still trying to calculate the number of people killed in much later conflicts like WWII and despite the extensive records kept by the belligerents the figures usually vary quite a bit
Going further back in the past naturally the variations become ever bigger
Historians can't even agree how many people lived in Constantinople or Baghdad or Cordoba at a certain point, let alone give precise estimates of the fatalities in any given conflict before the modern era
I mean, there is no doubt the Mongols were extremely brutal conquerors but there is no need to exaggerate and turn them into basically demons in human form who wanted nothing but to kill everyone they met

For context I am a social democrat civic nationalist from Bulgaria
Thanks

I had never visited before but I could tell a lot was going on and I can say that you are miles ahead of us, Bulgarians

Crying in Bulgarian
I'm a CompSci student in the UK and there are so many Romanians in the department that people joke that most students will end up learning Romanian from exposure in the 4 years of study
Same
Can you please do a large post with this data for all the EE ex-communist countries, so we can compare
It's not just that
Some of us choose to stay in shitty countries just so we can stay close to our families
Not everyone has that choice
I wouldn't say that my choice of Uni was due to the local ones being corrupt
IMO the difference between a good and a great Uni isn't the quality of education but the people you network with
I'm almost sure I'd learn basically the same stuff at a local Uni as I do in the UK but I wouldn't meet people as driven or as diverse
Also I think that living abroad for a few years is an experience that everyone who has the opportunity should try out
Laughs in Bulgarian
Yes, but people have also traveled or lived in another country for a few months
Example: I want to return to Barcelona
I want to move to Barcelona
I want to LIVE in Barcelona but I don't have that choice at the moment
Idk, I think that networking helps a lot
Every IT company I've interned at has had these "recommendation" systems where every full-time employee can recommend their friends
The friend gets to skip the first trivial interview stages that are basically time-wasters and the employee gets a bonus out of it
From what I know the more connections you have in the industry the more opportunities you have to job-hop and each hop equates to a pay rise
Since I started before the entire Brexit fiasco I'm eligible for a student loan from the UK government
Then a "poor student" bursary from my Uni covers my accommodation costs and the rest I pay off with money from summer internships
I've done one each summer since I graduated from high school, so I've basically not had to rely on my parents for financing anything
Why Germany
> Saw this on r/dankmemes and thought I'd pollute *other* subs with it
Fun fact, two reasons Iceland speed limit is so low
1) Snowstorms
2) Sheep often end up on the highway and if you hit a sheep, you have to pay for it, and the farmer gets to set the price
140 is indeed the maximum speed allowed in Bulgaria, but only on newly built sections of motorways and not all of them
So all in all about 100 km of roads in the whole country
My country never fails to amaze me
I thought 140 was the norm
Жули до дупка, вуте-е-е!
We have the best roads and the best cars in Europe
This is incorrect
All highways (~800km) have a speed limit of 140 with exceptions on some turns and tunnels, as well as a 60km stretch on one of the highways, which is in bad condition even for Bulgarian standards (so the solution was not to repair it but set the limit to 90km/h)
Technically you have to be at least 10 over for it to be punishable so 149 is fine and really they only start caring at 20 over because the fine for 10-19 over is only €25 so 159 is more like the real speed limit
It's mostly true for Bulgaria as well
Biggest problem is the condition of the roads imo, but of course we have a fair amount of idiots driving the wrong way on a highway because the missed the exit so it can't be just "infrastructure bad".
Not with these roads
At the service stations they have cctv set up so that you can look at from different parts of the highway ahead, so you can judge if it's safe to set off with the snow etc

We can't have memes in /r/europe but facebook boomer cartoons are ok
There are 2 groups
People angry about Brexit and people who think there are cultural differences between the nations in the UK
The Texas independence movement is literally a meme, meanwhile Scottish independence has pretty significant support
Americans don’t take these things seriously because they’re not serious
There has always been fringe weirdos talking about seceding from the country, but there hasn’t been any actual momentum, because they’re not real
However, Scottish independence has serious momentum, and is a serious consideration for them
Yes it does
Hypocrisy has nothing to do with this because they aren’t the same situation
In Bulgaria, "бира/bira" is used most of the times, but I've seen "пиво/pivo" used to describe an old-fashioned beer
GARAGARDOA
Tldr
: Beer
Cwrwadgsjkfhdhf
You're right
"Пиво/pivo" feels a bit more official if that makes sense
We use "пиво/pivo" as well, don't worry
They are interchangeable, but "pivo" feels more sophisticated and slightly old-fashioned
Its usage is more common in words describing beer manufacturing
For example, "пивоварна/pivovarna" means brewery
If she was young, it's entirely possible she didn't realize "пиво" is used for beer and not just any kind of drink
Younger people don't really care for old-timey words around here
Given that "pivo" is a part of the official names of a number of local beer brands (Shumensko, Pirinsko, Burgasko, etc), I agree with the other comments that you somehow found a singularly
ignorant waitress

Putin's response was that of a tyrant, it was not adequate and attacked the sovereignty of Ukraine
Point to me a conflict like that in the last 20-30 even 40 years where the United states invaded it's neighbour because they were going to sign an economic treaty with a different union
Where did they annex a territory, where did they down a civilian aircraft, where did they attack passing trade ships, where did they deny doing it

Bulgaria has a bit of an issue with the idolisation of historic figures
Having various czars plastered on first grade classroom walls combined with recitals of patriotic poetry are like a form of indoctrination and the history lessons are practically propaganda
Yes, it's creepy as fuck, I'm glad I'm not the only one scared by it
There's some really conservative people on that subreddit but it's definitely better
The new generation is a bit more disillusioned/perceptive
It's generally people who know foreign languages and who are more connected to the outer world that have a better chance of realising this stuff
I was really lucky to have good foreign teachers and history teachers who were adamant on approaching history critically
It was a watershed moment when a German teacher told us he's not patriotic in like the 8th grade

It's already clear, NATO is a defensive alliance
And we stand with Greece and Armenia
Didn't only some NATO members bomb Serbia
Which would make it a voluntary offensive initiative not something NATO can force on its members and so similarly Turkey can't force NATO to assist its attack
They should if they want but why haven't they done it already if they so desperately wanted
Yes what about it
Because we want to help duh
I mean countries are legally required to help Turkey if it gets attacked
But not if it's the one attacking
I'm not finding what you're saying so give a link please
According to Wikipedia "Merciful Angel" wasn't even the official name but a Serbian mistranslation
I can't find sources on who did what exactly but apparently Serbia tried to sue 10 NATO members and it had 16 at the time so I'm assuming the rest weren't involved much
We'll see about that
Because it's not its primary objective
It's not like NATO forbids offence
Members are free to do that, other NATO members just aren't obligated to follow them
But they are obliged to do something in case a NATO member is attacked
That's how it's defensive
That has nothing to do with NATO members being forced to participate though
And another note although people were killed by NATO, it's participation still pales in comparison to the actual Yugoslav wars which killed 130k people
NATO killed one thousand
Well it's NATO, the most powerful military alliance to have ever existed
Naturally there would be few attacks on it meanwhile its members have lots of opportunities to attack
NATO's track record hasn't been stellar but frankly considering it represent a huge chunk of global military and economic might it could have been much worse
I could see this power being far more abused  if it were in the hands of many others
Look at for example what Turkey is doing despite being  a midget compared to NATO
Or can you imagine Russia with 25 times bigger GDP
If NATO were really offensive most of the world would be under it probably
> Countries were forced to participate, including Greece
Well  that's why I asked you a source
At the very least it seems others weren't forced
>How is war in Yugoslavia connected to Kosovo conflict
One happened in 91-95 and other one started in 98
It's considered one of the Yugoslav wars and besides if death and destruction is what you care about then it's only natural we don't only focus on NATO's part in those conflicts
>Nato has no legal morals,
Yeah
There's very little morality on the world stage and a military alliance is definitely not the first place it should be expected in
The argument is more like that NATO hasn't had more defensive moments because no one is dumb enough to be attacking it
The rest is  to show what a truly offensive NATO would look like
>Look, I don't think NATO is some bloodthirsty behemoth without any impulse control, and there is obviously a defensive component to the whole thing, but that's not all there is
Yes, alright, so it's primarily defensive
I think, especially in the context of a Turkey-Armenia conflict, that's what matters
> I don't know what that means
I'm saying that if NATO were truly aggressive we would be seeing that everywhere because NATO just has  opportunities and temptations to be aggressive that no one else has
>I wouldn't call it primarily defensive
Fifty-fifty at best, if assigning such a figure makes sense
I'd rank it better but  I think we're kinda talking about different things
I think  we should make a distinction between what NATO members do and what NATO does
Aggression from NATO members is more like an extra-curricular activity that some countries do on their own time
You have the most aggressive members in the US, UK, France and then you have more peaceful ones like Germany or the ones in the North and East
But the most peaceful ones aren't obligated to participate even if they sometimes do
In the end what really links NATO countries is that they have to support each other in the event someone is attacked, although like you said there's   leeway there if you don't want to follow the spirit of the treaty
Nothing says communism better then using tanks against your own people
great stuff
Greetings from Bulgaria
(our metro also expanding by EU funds)
4 New stations opened last month on Sofia
Thanks EU
EU has a lot of problems, but to leave it because of that is like cutting your foot to prevent stubbing your toe on a table
For a corrupt country like mine, EU is the only chance to have someone slap our politicians' wrist when they become too greedy
True
As a Bulgarian layman I always considered Germany and Switzerland Western Europe, Croatia Southern Europe, Poland Eastern Europe and the Baltics Northern Europe
Everything else is Uneurope
I can't speak for the other SE European nations but I've always seen Bulgaria as a less Eastern European and much more Southeastern, we share a lot of similarities with souther Europeans, most not good qualities but still
I don't like this map
Sounds nice, like a pillar in the middle of the Danube
How do people working in offices deal with the sweat from the bike ride
I would love to go to work with a bike even tho I'll probably get killed on our streets but the sweat is a no-no for me
That’s a kick ass bike
In Netherlands, the bike is part of the formal attire
Obviously
Dutch people don't sweat, got it
That's what I expect to hear really, that basically everyone is wet and or sweaty but nobody cares
I was trying to find a justification of me going to work sweaty and with messed up cloths but I just cant, we are not there yet, not even close
jesus, that's bad

You shouldn't judge by the numbers but by what information and stuff they are trying to hide
I personally think Nazi and communist glorifing regime shit should be censored
I don't enjoy seeing dudes spreading lies while these regimes slaughtered millions in brutal ways, ways we don't kill animals now
It is disrespectful to those who were killed and to those whose family members were killed

Can you source your bleeding dry argument
Investments in public transportation, infrastructure, social services, education and science are up or at least have remained constant
France has an unemployment rate standing at about 9%. So yeah some people got a pay boost and because no actual reform can take place to make France more competitive, it was those 9% who made the sacrifice
They are the truly poor and they got fucked by low income earners wanting more for themselves
Instead of a creation of jobs thru reforms and lower corporate tax, they made sure that French labor is the least competitive in the EU
Germany had a similar problem and the Hartz plan generally helped bring unemployment down
Economist agree that the reforms in Germany made sense and were needed, the effects are obvious in that Germany now has very low unemployment rate while before it was as big as France has currently
Look at 2002 just before the reforms, 10% just like France
A TON of laws have passed SPECIFICALLY for poorer people ! Like higher (+100€) minimum pensions for the retired ? Like the transfer of social contributions from the retired (except the poorest retired) to the workers ? Like the removal of the local housing tax except for richer people ?The ONLY law that was passed specifically for rich people was the removal of the "Impôt sur la Fortune", which was scientifically a terrible, terrible tax which did not succeed at transferring money from the rich to the poor
On the contrary, the increase of the CSG hits the wealthy because it taxes CAPITAL gains, which is something I'm sure you're very happy about, right ? What about thr "poverty plan" ? It's seen by the social sector as one of the best social plans ever written by a government, because it really tackles the root issues of poverty in France .
France needs a progressive corporate tax system like the UK
Right now the 33
33% tax is not only higher than the maximum tax in the UK(30%), it doesn't help smaller businesses
For below 300k profits the tax rate is 19% for the UK
Even not putting a progressive system making the tax 28
8% is a good move
You need it to make it easier to start a business in France
Easy to understand tax code, easy to understand laws and websites by the government that are user friendly and explain all the necessary bureaucracy in a straight manner
Like the UK does
Why did I have to use to 3-rd party websites to get the information about tax in France
I think Macron was right wanting to remove some labor laws and try and boost the economy
The Netherlands, UK and Germany have lower benefits, had labour reforms but at the same time below 5% unemployment, so is it a coincidence that these reforms correlated with a decrease in unemployment rates
Reforms to the vocational-training system will help remove the barriers for hiring people
I know there was a law where a company could not slash jobs in France if the company was doing ok globally
This is a silly law and just removes any incentive to setup an HQ or factory in France
It removes their ability to do dynamic changes to be competitive
Reform of employment tribunals
If you can't fire employees that are bad, or make it very hard, overall a business will be slow in hiring new workers,especially youth workers
Macron’s overhaul of the labor code has helped ease those concerns, and hiring on permanent contracts rose 6
4 percent in the fourth quarter to 48 percent, a level not seen since before the global financial crisis
Improve training for the unemployed
This is obvious, a lack of skilled workers is creating production bottlenecks and snarling up supply chains
Macron’s government also plans to invest 15 billion euros in job training over the next five years
Increase spending on Research and Development as well as education
France needs competitive universities
The Yellow vest supposed(as said by the BBC) demand to decrease entry requirements is backwards
The better the schools the more talent will come
Help tech startups with some no tax incentive, they will hire young people from University and if they succeed they will bring more in tax over time than the initial bonus
>Pupils’ chances of escaping their socio-economic background are smaller in France than in any of the other 71 countries surveyed
His reforms are seen as positive both by teachers,universities and business
But yet French residents are against them, why, why fear change
What if it's a bit harder to get in to university if your education is overall better
>Government proposes 2% increase to research ministry’s cash allocation for 2019
It seems his doing the right thing here
>Despite spending as much on secondary schooling as other OECD countries, France no longer achieves corresponding results
Between 2003 and 2012, performance in international maths tests fell compared with other countries
The real shock was an international study of reading known as PIRLS, published in 2017, in which French pupils lagged in 34th position, behind those in Spain, Portugal and Italy
Their level had dropped by 14 points since 2001
The bac is an entrance ticket to university, yet too many students drop out once they get there
Fully 70% of undergraduates, says the ministry, fail to complete their degree in three years
>On February 14th Jean-Michel Blanquer, the education minister and a former director of ESSEC, a top French business school, is due to unveil his reform plans for the bac
>The new French bac, which will be awarded for the first time in 2021, will look more like the school-leaving exam in other European countries, where continuous assessment represents a big chunk of the final grade, and subject specialism, such as for British A-levels, is common
In France, though, the shake-up may well create an uproar
Many in the teaching profession fear that continuous assessment will kill the prized national standard, and in effect bring in a two-tier bac, with more prestigious grades being awarded by top teachers in top schools, rather than by national markers
Teachers of subjects that may become optional are worried about their future
Unions are threatening strikes
>The government hopes to overhaul an ailing university system, which international students have previously voted the worst in Europe
France has pledged to invest almost a billion euros into higher education over the next five years
>Macron has proposed to tighten the selection process for those entering French universities, while at present all French high school graduates are guaranteed a public university place regardless of their grades
>“The reform introduced the fact that the criteria used to select students is going to be based on the marks of their last years of high school, on their motivation and teacher’s opinions, and not at all on the baccalaureat,”
>Students across France have been staging protests against President Emmanuel Macron’s proposed education reforms, which would introduce tougher entry requirements for the country’s universities
It seems that it's not a matter of free university or giving you a social net that helps escape poverty
You need a good and fair education system first
But paradoxically at the same students are against any reforms that will make entry harder even if that means a reformed bac test, which would make it easier
So any reform be it education,labor or tax is met with unions,students or residents stopping it
Yet the same people then what reforms that make France greener,competitive,want higher wages, less tax but more social spending
It seems that a stalemate of the French social contract has formed, where reforms are wanted but not accepted
It seems that Macron's liberalization reforms actually did help the unemployment rate
Going bellow 2008 levels after he became president and started his reforms, as well as plans to slash corporate tax rate
France tried that and it failed miserably, currently it has a higher than both Germany and the UK corporate tax, and higher taxes on the rich, at one point going up to 70% of income
The bleeding dry argument has no merit if you actually bother to check the statistics
Investments in public transportation are up, investments in education are up, the science budget is up,investments in infrastructure are up
Nobody is bleeding them dry, this is just protestor propaganda at this point or a gross misconception that has naturally propagated across social media
France has an unemployment rate standing at about 9%. So yeah some people got a pay boost and because no actual reform can take place to make France more competitive, it was those 9% who made the sacrifice so that the current employed enjoy higher benefits
They are the truly poor and they got fucked by low income earners wanting more for themselves
Instead of a creation of jobs thru reforms and lower corporate tax, they made sure that French labor is the least competitive in the EU

It seems that a stalemate of the French social contract has formed, where reforms are wanted but not accepted
> You can see this blindness clearly in your argument against lower cost university
Higher entry requirments doesn't mean higher cost for students
As far as I understand the reforms the government will still pay you to go to school
No one is talking, or at least I'm not talking and neither is Macron for the implementation of fees but for a reform in the bac, as well as fixing a standing issue of low social mobility thru education
>Pupils’ chances of escaping their socio-economic background are smaller in France than in any of the other 71 countries surveyed
This needs to be fixed but lowering your standing on the world list as well as your research output is not the way to go about it
It's simply the worst possible fix
Reforming the bac will do much more than simply lowering the grades for entry
Attack the problem not a symptom
>At no point did I hear anyone in France talk about competitivity of universities, except those who want to increase their cost to entry of course
You can also see this in your conclusion
But see just because you think my opinion is that of another person doesn't make it so
The reforms I linked are regarding entry requirements and modernizing the University system
“The reform introduced the fact that the criteria used to select students is going to be based on the marks of their last years of high school, on their motivation and teacher’s opinions, and not at all on the baccalaureat,”
They also propose to change the format of the bac to be more aligned with the rest of Europe
You can't tell me with a straight face that me talking about falling mathematics scores and entry requirements is the same as someone talking about increasing or more accurately implementing fees
This is the definition of a straw man and you just did it
>What I heard was : people want more public services, and don't want poor people to pay for it, because it's unfair
You skipped everything I said and how the poor aren't actually taxed more
Or do you mean the 6c eco tax that was well less for the average person than the decrease in house tax
The rest of your argument is based on emotional reasoning that really no reply can argue with since it isn't rational
You paint a picture of a stance I don't really hold
Pretty much 90% of your argument is strawmaning what I've said and what it actually meant instead of taking it at face value
I meant what I said and nothing more, nothing less
> let's take the money where it is
Was the ISF an absurd tax ? Maybe, but at least it was that : a tax on capital
But capital gains tax did increase
Taxes on poor people were removed and those on rich people remain
You are repeating your blind rhetoric without actually reading my original reply
>You're just justifying German or British policies, failing to remember that we're talking about France, a country with an egalitarian culture contrary to the other two
Economic policy of the kind I'm talking about has nothing to do with culture,egalitarianism or family values
This is yet another emotional argument that really doesn't mean anything
>And I think you're wrong
Yes, you have copied every single argument that we've been hearing in every big media since the '07/'08 crisis, and we've been applying it, result ? It failed
You mean when the socialist government was in power and then proceeded to tax rich people up to 75% of their money and gave out free shit to everyone and nothing improved in the slightest, instead both the education system and health system started to worsen in quality
This is the same reforms that are proposed today, really
Why are they proposing a new law that is the same as the old one, unless
you are full of shit and haven't even read the proposed reforms
Is this a joke or something
I didn't copy my arguments it's simply want is needed and it definitely has not been implemented since 2007 as you assert
>We've added the word equality everywhere for a reason, we aren't a liberal country and never will be
I fail to see how individual freedoms are against an equal society but ok
This is another one of those emotional arguments on how things are just too different and unique and nobody understands the perils of the poor French people
It's a stupid argument because it doesn't address any of my points but simply taunts a difference in culture to every proposed solution or reform, to the point where you said nothing of substance since you don't actually speak for the entire country nor do yo actually represent everyone's feelings
We can talk about subjects with studies and proposed solutions, the pros and cons of those solutions but if we just start blabing on about the emotional baggage of stuff the conversation comes to an end since we're not arguing about points now but emotional appeal
That is, you appeal to this rebellion ideal that doesn't actually manifest in these protests
I wonder if this is some kind of fallacy, appeal to ideal or something
>Did you actually heard workers saying they wanted to lower their paycheck ? Or who wanted to work more for less ? Or who wanted the hygiene protection service to go away ? Or who wanted each company to be able to abolish the law if they don't want to respect it ? Because I didn't.
>But protests have also erupted over other issues, including calls for higher wages, lower taxes, better pensions and easier university entry requirements
Also politico has a list of the 42 demands, that I think was first shared by the economist reporter on twitter
You can't just protest without having some kind of demands
The fuel tax, something we can argue all day that is beneficial for France and the WORLD, of 6c has been removed now
Obviously there's more demands,right
Well you can't say you didn't hear protestors wanting stuff but still protesting, that's absurd
>What I heard was : people want more public services, and don't want poor people to pay for it, because it's unfair
This simple sentence is what justify the "reforms are wanted" illusion, but that's not the truth : nobody asked for them
What people want is less poverty, higher wages, how ? Well, while we're loosing money, finance has never been as healthy as it is today so there we go : let's take the money where it is
Was the ISF an absurd tax ? Maybe, but at least it was that : a tax on capital
Taking it away was the one gift too many
This is absurd
You can't want less unemployment, more investments etc without the proposed reforms, unless you just want France to borrow money until it's credit rating gets destroyed and it defaults leaving everybody in the country worse off
France already employs more than almost any other EU nation via government spending, this is not the way forward
Creating a stable economy with a good middle class via investments and attracting business is way more sustainable than just employing a bunch of people doing inefficient work on minimum wage
What does the finance is a sector that's doing good have to do with tax, they already pay the 33
33% income tax and every worker,banker,investor pays income and capital gains tax on their individual earnings as well
Do you think it makes any economic sense to go and take the bank's money and pay for shit with it
Do you understand how banks work, where their money comes from
It comes from the people, you are literally saying you want to rob the people so that you can give it back to them
What part of the finance sector, that  offers tens of thousands of high paying jobs, do you want to destroy exactly
Be more specific than pointing at finance and demanding some mythical tax
A tax on what exactly, which part of the sector, how will that influence the development of that sector, will it destroy more jobs than it will bring via government spending
You have not actually answered any of these questions, the proposal lack depth or actual though a part from a shallow pointing of the finger, it will not lead to reforms, it will not lead to prosperity
To be honest I fail to see it do anything but diminish the sectors growth and weaken Paris for when Brexit happens and the London financial sector starts seeking a new home
Like Frankfurt or Amsterdam
I guess I'll have to repeat myself
Higher (+100€) minimum pensions for the retired , the transfer of social contributions from the retired (except the poorest retired) to the workers , the removal of the local housing tax except for richer people were pro lower class laws passed by this government without the protests, another wage hike has been given plus the removal of fuel tax
The ONLY law that was passed specifically for rich people was the removal of the "Impôt sur la Fortune", which was scientifically a terrible, terrible tax which did not succeed at transferring money from the rich to the poor
On the contrary, the increase of the CSG hits the wealthy because it taxes CAPITAL gains, which is something I'm sure you're very happy about, right ? What about the "poverty plan" ? It's seen by the social sector as one of the best social plans ever written by a government, because it really tackles the root issues of poverty in France . Why are you ignoring that
You say you want more public services but Macron's government HAS INCREASED PUBLIC SPENDING
Government proposes 2% increase to research ministry’s cash allocation for 2019
FOR THE SECOND YEAR IN A ROW AN INCREASE MORE THAN THAT OF INFLATION
Macron’s government also plans to invest 15 billion euros in job training over the next five years
France has pledged to invest almost a billion euros into higher education over the next five years
On top of the normal budget
> now students have to be selected
Students always had to be selected for tertiary education
The new plan makes it so that your entire high school performance is looked at, and the final exam is now more like A levels vs a general knowledge test
Where you come from is not a criteria
It's kinda laughable we're disusing this when in it;s widely known fact that the previous method was in favour of the rich
In order to get to nice ecoles you had to know someone or be from a rich family
Now you have a better shot
Can you source your claim
Like give me a link to the specific document
I know some french but my GF will translate it for me
>APL decrease
Tax increase for the lower middle class
Only tax that was implemented was the fuel tax, no other changes to the tax code have been done a part from what we already discussed
Can you link me a source on the increased taxes for lower and middle class brackets
It seems the taxes are the same as they were 2 years ago
Thus we've not seen an increase
>No, because economics are a hard science about rational actors
Seriously, we're talking about politics, obviously it has to do with what the people want, how they see their life and what their values are
The same idea might be good in the eyes of the Brits and bad in the eyes of the French
There is no objectively good answer in politics, because if there was, we'll just have a cast of scientists leading the world with their cold and objective science and not little group of democracies disagreeing on fundamental principles like how the economy should work and what objective is the most important in a given situation
But we're talking economics here, what can the government do with it's tools to influence the market and society to prosperity
The actions needed for a society to prosper are not always populsit, in fact they rarely are
Populism often mistaken for the will of the people is proposing simple ad hoc solution to complex problems that do not in fact take the bigger picture in to accord or even base their finding in studies
Like a populist opinnion would be rent controls for instance, but empirical evidence has shown that it doesn't work and economic theory supports that finding
Should we still implement those rent controls even though the science says no
I don't think so
In this case the people do not want a tax on them because, well, nobody likes paying more for gas
But studies have shown that it does effect what type of car people choose
Coupled with the tax right off for electric cars, the carbon tax, something proposed both by climate scientist  and macro economist, is a step in to the right direction
It's easily seen in both the US and EU market that when fuel prices go up, people buy more fuel efficient cars
>This paper evaluates the effect of fuel prices on new vehicle fuel economy in the eight largest Europe an markets . The analysis spans the years 2002 – 200 7 and uses detailed vehicle registration and specification data to control for policies, consumer preferences, and other potentially confounding factors
Fuel prices have a statistically significant effect on new vehicle fuel economy in Europe , but t his estimated effect is much smaller than that for the United States .** Within Europe, fuel economy respond s more in the United Kingdom and France than in the other large markets**
>Who had Macron as minister of the economy and was heavily criticized by the left wing because they did nothing for the people and by the right wing because their policies were absolutely stupid ? Also the same government that gave companies 40 billions euros as a gift because "they'll create a million jobs if we do" which did absolutely nothing ?
Mind sourcing that
I tried searching for a tax right off or even direct subsidies but could not find anything really
He seems to have done an ok but not exceptional job, what would you say was bad about his rulings
The OECD estimated that the Macron Law would generate a "0
3% increase in GDP over five-years and a 0
4% increase over 10-years"[73] Ludovic Subran, the chief economist at credit insurance company, Euler Hermes, estimated that Macron Law would give France a GDP increase of 0
it says his main criticism was he failure to stop a factory from closing
He also increased the government share in Renault
He was minister only for less than 2 years
I don't see anything on him approving a 40 billion law
>Liberal in the economics sense
You're applying liberal ideas : we should loosen workers right, lower taxes on companies, etc
These ideas don't work in France, they never did, they never will
These ideas work everywhere
I'm not talking about destroying the entire thing and neither is Macron
A progressive tax system for companies is good news, and some workers rights are absurd or badly made
You can still have a high standard but not be absurd
I already talked on what I think is absurd in the first post
These are liberal ideas in the sense that they will free up the markets so that efficiency can be made
The same thing happened in Germany can you tell me, without saying the French values are different because they really aren't, what makes the French market not flexible to such changes
I want an economic reason
If you think the French political spectrum is left, well why didn't you vote for the communist party or socialist or whatever
In fact it seems a lot of people in France like to vote to the right side of spectrum
I don't see anthropological arguments as a basis to make current governance
An essay is not proof
In fact such a conjecture has the nice touch of being unprovable really
Such are the social sciences
Emmanuel Todd speculates that so and so is true but he presents no real proof but offering more assertions
If I understand you correctly you seem to think, that what France wants, because of some dudes unscientific cherry-picked analysis of older generations, a communist governance
In that case may I recommend you read The Road to Serfdom by Hayek
He uses good arguments on why any revolution of the people follows a strong leader race where only the worst can win, making all forms of communism or more precise all governments saying communism soon^tm to be a dead end
I can go on to how communism is not an effective distributor of goods in a society and so on but we're not arguing that right now
>pro-rich reforms have already gone throug
What pro rich reforms
The increase in capital gains
The French government decided to abolish ISF and replace it with the tax on real estate (IFI)
Professional property was always exempt from this tax which kinda says a lot of it's capabilities of being an anti rich people tax
Taxing investments is simply not a good move, I understand taxing capital gains, as that is a form of income but taxing investments, and I don't mean assets, is simply a way to stop having ANY foreign investment in the country and to make already rich locals remove the money from the economy by investing it in ANY other EU market
Surely you can't think that's good for the average person
The tax
Several countries have abolished their versions of the tax in recent years, including Austria, Denmark, Germany, The Netherlands, Finland, Sweden and Spain, and Greece
In Sweden, among other places, the elimination has had no effect on inequality, and there are signs it has actually spurred growth
The tax accounts for less than 1
5 % of revenue and it's main source of taxation remains in the new law, so no real change will be seen
Macron is going to increase as from the tax year 2018 the level of social contributions on pension income, investment income and capital gains
He proposes to increase the rate of the so-called Contribution Sociale Généralisée by 1
7 percentage points
The average ISF payer, paid less than 2k of tax, really the tax was symbolic at best
>Which, before the yellow jackets revolt, was going to also hit a lot of not so wealthy retired people, who when they worked were told that "we're taking your money and giving it to your parents", and now our told "we're taking your money and giving it to your children"...
Source, the planned change in pensions was planned before the revolt according to the BBC
>My entire family works in social institutions, I can tell you, not a single one of them told me it was "the best social plan", and even if it was, it's overshadowed by the rest
Not according to most people
They are also planning a negative tax income or UBI
Something all socialist have been campaigning for years
Under his new tax plan more people will be included in free healthcare and more money will be given to hospitals
An overblown story might not be the best basis on your opinion on the budget, the fact is the budget for HC has increased more than inflation
He's pledged money for schools already way before the protests, it's not possible to do this overnight you know
He has offered training to help the specialization gap before the protests, and lowest research money from WE goes to the UK
The budget according to french scientist is getting better in a acceptable manner when it comes to research
Also done before the protest
It is unnecessarily huge
Last time we had 25 parties and here is our [ballot] You mark the party on the left and then on the right you can mark a preferred candidate

I was going to say Bulgarian's one was perfect although if you got with it to /r/bulgaria people would have conducted a civil conversation proving you wrong
Redditing Bulgarians seem pretty chill
Well yeah, the truth hurts the most
You should know that "Most Bulgarians are Gypsies

Because the type of Bulgarians that would lash out and be idiotic don't really know English that well and probably don't even know about reddit
> -Your language is a dialect of Bulgarian
The truth is always the worst
Your point is about macedonians, not about bulgarians
What are you on about
Oh wait points are now macedonian also
I doubt that Bulgaria & Romania are in the same category
When I was i Bucharest literally everybody was speaking good enough english there
Even some low paid workers, while in Bulgaria is a common thing even a high paying workers to speak garbage english (source: I've been to a few conferences where I literally cannot understand what they're talking, since their accent is the worst, no idea why they're even trying)
This sad
Me not happy
Bulgaria very good English
The one for Bulgaria is only accurate for Sofia pretty much
Nobody in the south speaks English

Ok, question for the political majors:
What can the EU do in this instance
From what little I know about politics, violating a nation's sovereignty is tantamount to declaring war, so direct intervention is out
They're not in the EU, so no legal channels on that end either
Economic sanctions (though that seems it'll hurt the population more than the rulers)
They got some boats doe

Um in Bulgaria we have very tight regulations right now
The bigger regional cities are closed, you can't go to the park and people overall follow restrictions and social distance
We take it pretty seriously and I think we reacted quite quickly compared to the other European countries
And I love it
calling it now: Brazil 0 - Uganda 4 in 2022
That's so sad
This is NOT the way
Now there's no one to shit on
Yeah I want to be in Schengen too :(
But honestly, I'm happy we even made it to the EU, there was a lot of opposition here, and we all know we are far from the most deserving member state too

>...pizzas, I recommend seafood
Ew, get out of here, this should be banned ASAP along with the pineapples
Seriously though, that was a good response
Kinda makes you happy to think it's not that easy for everyone out there to get ahold of a whole country's laws and rules (unless of course you're someone as Erdogan and Putin and you've worked hard for that)
(Edit: To stir things up, I actually love and eat only two types of pizza, Margarita and Marinara
I cannot remember a single time when I've eaten meat on pizza, let alone sea creature on pizza
So for all of you giving wonderful ideas about pizzas, you're replying to *that* type of person
(Jokes aside, I got that thing about Iceland and seafood)
Yep, read some Askreddit right after the election and got the impression the guy have prepared for over 10 years to run for President
But he's yet to seize control the way Putin and Erdogan did
Oh no, actually no
At least Eastern Europe is full of ridiculous politicians, and Erdogan is almost there too
Welp, there's a difference between east and west regarding Europe, and now that I think of, the west isn't immune to ridiculous politicians too (Le Pen, Boris Johnson
Very disappointed that no Bulgarian has decided to organise a demonstration

I have been living in Scotland for nearly 6 years
Graduated from Dundee Uni two years ago and I must say the education in Scotland is absolutely amazing
Not only  is it free but it has some of the best universities not only in Europe but the world (Edi Uni, Glasgow Uni, St
Andrews)
I would highly recommend studying and living here
I couldn't agree more
I loved every bit of my 4 years there as well
I do not have any information about that, but if you get accepted in a Scottish uni before brexit hits they will definitely pay for your education
The free tuition applies only for graduate schemes and a very limited amount of master degrees
Most masters degrees are paid and actually quite expensive
I would recommend taking a look at this website: [ You can probably find a free masters or a fully funded one
I would also recommend going straight for a PHD because in the UK you can skip masters and jump from undergrad to phd student if you are interested in that
I am not sure how it works if your undergrad is not from the UK but I would be surprised if there is a problem
If you are interested in a PHD you can take a look here: [
Also Edi Uni is an amazing choice I am actually in the process of applying for a Phd in Data science there
&#x200B;
Well I have been working since day one to support myself and also I am currently working as a developer, so I have paid my due and will continue to invest in the country
So take your typical English welcome and piss off
What's more I used to rent a flat in Hilltown haha
Thank you and good luck
Well the education is: 4yx 9k =36k(which is not true cuz when i started it was still 6
3k but let me indulge you)
I have currently returned 4yx2k+2yx6k= 20k in taxes so I am pretty close
Also the free education only applies for EU nationals like myself which anyways stay here and return the investment everybody else has to pay
Whats more the government makes so much money from all the asian students that pay 2-3 times more than natives so don't kid yourself that it is the English taxpayer that pays for the free education
Also I find it very weird that you dont moan about the millions of junkies and 18 year old girls that get pregnant in order to get benefits but you complain about smart and ambitious people coming and making this country better
Let me guess you voted for England(Scotland did not vote yes) to leave the UK
I admit I always get very defensive because I am kinda tired of being accused of being a leech when I actually care a lot about the UK and try my best to be productive and give back so when I saw your comment I presumed you meant it in a bad way
However I have never gotten a tax exception of any kind so I am not sure about what other services you mean
Yeah I got you basically since education is not part of the taxes you pay you cant really repay for your education
Also its fair to say that a large amount of that was paid by the English because they are so many compared to Scotland, Wales and NI but not all
Literally the same as Mark
Rutten from the Netherlands
We're basically fucked but what else is new
This is a very weak swear word
It's literally "to hell with it". We have plenty of others with more oomph in them
In Bulgarian "Po dyavolite" is exactly heck
The "fuck" equivalent in here is "ebal sum ti majkata", which literally translates to: "I will fuck your mom". We also have like 10-15 ways to phrase that and I don't think anything else comes close in popularity
The Bulgarian one is very very wrong
And why is it in Latin characters
Some of these seem way too innocent to be credible
This reminds me of *The Good Place* and how they said Fork because they couldn't say Fuck
This is likely the Fork version of the map
Can we have the Fuck version now please
The bulgarian one is kinda mild, it's like 'damn'. Deba or ebati would be more like it
In Bulgaria we mosly say
Еби му майката Or боклук грозен Or в на майка ти устата Or пичка ти лелина Or маамкаму or да ти се невиди и "     " Or да ти еба майката Or курва Or шибан "insert profession " Or еби се Or боклук or деба твойта мама дееба Or бастун. But yeah по дяволите works
Po diavolite for Bulgaria is good, but not correct
Mostly we say "bahti", "basi", "deba, "daeba", "dagoeba"
Balkans legit got offended by the weak swear words you placed there
Prepare to get your mother jebana, OP
I'm sorry, you brought this on yourself
Po dyavolite is REAL mild
In bulgarian we would say something along the lines of "maika mu deiba" meaning fuck something's mom (applicable to virtually everything)
Pretty much the same for Bulgaria
"Po dyavolite" means pretty much "Damn it" or "to hell with it". Something like that
Should be the ol' reliable "Maika ti deeba"
OP failed miserably with most of Europe sounding like they're in 4th grade
"Po dyavolite" specifically is an artificially created term to translate "fuck" in movies while being very mild
Що не пишете на БГ ве маа му дееба?
The gold standard
Just "Deeba" at the least
In this case, it's not even fourth grade, nobody actually says "Po dyavolite" in real life
You can only find it in translated books or movies

Alright, thanks for the info
Really
Does the US need to be mentioned here
I think it's good to compare the EU with the US sometimes but let's not make it an obsession
On a different note, wow imagine what this woman lived through
She was a little girl when WW1 started, lived through it, WW2, Nazis, reunification and now she's watching European states peacefully come together
Nothing's bad
Some people say Europeans can be a bit obsessed with America
I don't agree personally and have nothing against comparing the two
I do it often myself
But in this case in particular I can see how someone might think that
It's kinda stupid that information about the emergency European number starts off by telling us what the US emergency number is, no
And in fact half the message is about the US
Call it banter if you like but in that case we could at least diversify our banter to include other countries
Interesting values we have in Bulgaria
That 8C° must be from the weather station at Musala peak (i think it's the only such case on the map), but I've got no idea why it shows 15C° near Sofia (the capital)
Were those 16 degrees over Sofia recorded on some mountain top
Last couple of days it was 20 degrees after dark
There are some places like in Italy or Bulgaria where there are 25-30+ temperatures and then in between them 15 or 17, why is that
>but I've got no idea why it shows 15C° near Sofia (the capital)
Cherni Vrah (highest peak of Vitosha) also has a weather station
Should be the station on Cherni Vrah (highest peak in Vitosha mountain overseeing Sofia)
I can swear it was over 30 today
Even at 8pm the car said it was 22C outside
I'm pretty sure you can't fly drones over Paris
Yee Haw
Wait
Didn't the Russians start out in Kiev
Or are the Kiev Rus a separate entity altogether
Ah now I understand
Thank you
Having an Estonian name for a city doesn't mean that it is or ever was an Estonian city
You are confusing Pskov with [Pechory]
Your country first became independent in 1918 and certainly never included Pskov
So what does this have to do with whether Pskov was part of Estonia
Pechory (Petsery in Estonian) is a separate town from Pskov
Benis :DDD
Bulgaria is now on Russia's list of ''unfriendly countries''
It's an honour

Oh no

Well that's a first
Finally some good news

WOOOOOO
I am surprised the list is not longer honestly
We're in, nice
We made it boys
And we're part of a positive list for once
cool
Good for us I guess
Amazing
We must stand by Ukraine against Russian aggression
Good
Twas about time
oh no anyway
They can do whatever they want
The Russian people and the Bulgarian people never forget their connection and the love for each other
The state can build a giant monument to their hatred for us, we'll just use it for the shade
I feel so proud of my country right now
I've been seeing people say "What would Russia / Turkey / x" want with Bulgaria for years now
Personally I don't know what the answer could be or why anyone would be interested in an impoverished shithole like Bulgaria, but apparently that's the situation and that has been the situation for the last ~1400 years
Its because there is yet another stupid spy scandal thats why
Lukashenko has annoyed Putin quite a lot, but Putin probably needs him for now
If Belarus gets integrated with Russia, it's game over for Bats'ka
I hope our stay is welcome
Happy to be here
Heeey, my bois
Thank you
I'm in, let's do it
my thoughts exactly
Why would they wanna invade Bulgaria
I hope the same thing
Russia is being slowed down thanks the idiotic government
Thanks
Well it's hard to explain
After years of our government  and prosecution doing nothing about information that Russia had repeatedly tried to poison a weapons manufacturer and his son who were arming Ukraine, they were at last spurred into action  when Czechia said that their deadly blast was meant to go off in Bulgaria and ruin the company's reputation
Now Russia got accused for 4 other intentional looking  explosions at  two of our arms companies and apparently the Salisbury duo were touring the country at the same time as some of the accidents
On one hand the weapons manufacturer, Gebrev, disputes some of our prosecution's accusations against Russia, on the other he accuses them of shielding the Russian spies
So for all of that we expelled a diplomat
And Russia's losing its shit
I think you were in this a couple days ago, but we have somehow managed to qualify

I'm dissapointed
There's a huge gay porn company there, so that might be why it's such a big number

Lol
Reminds me of [Lady Gaga's music video for Alejandro]
Don't know how they asked the question but at least in Bulgaria you have to specifically ask Japanese or South Korean otherwise people lurch into thinking other nationalities
We think of Japanese as highly educated and advanced
In fact the most famous hotel (Marina) and best regarded hospital (Tokuda) in Bulgaria are Japanese or built by them
We'd hate Muslim for all eternity and what they did to us for 600 years
But we do love the jews though ️
"To feel like a white person" - Actual Bulgarian expression

In what universe is Asian not a race
Also, how would you classify a gypsy
Asian
White

This is definitely coming from a person who has never lived near gypsies

Saint Nicholas comes every year to give presents to the good children
And the bad children he takes with him when he leaves
Saint Nicholas comes with a ship
From Spain
And, most importantly, home to Saint Nicholas who brings presents to all good  Dutch children
The bad children get taken away from their families and taken to Spain

Ah yeah, fair enough
Still disagree that they are essentially the same seeing as Belgium is actually doing ok in the money and population departments while Bulgaria
Not so much
Ah my bad
Yeah, same for the Netherlands
He-wwo Mr Putin uwu
In the EU you get not 1, not 2 but 3 Steps to influence a bill
1: Vote on which elements will be in it
2: Is the proposition acceptable
3: Final vote if it should be accepted
This was step 1
Stop the Hysteria
That's how the EU is, the people there have dedicated their lives to writing regulation and it's the only think they are capable of, to them it's an instinct
Pirate more and you won't be affected
In the EU you get not 1, not 2 but 3 Steps to influence a bill

It is an effective way to dodge EU regulations
Me too
Fuck this policy
A bunch of overpaid **and** easy to buy dicksuckers
I, too, would want to know more about this
AFAIK article 11 prevents people from showing thumbnails and snippets of news articles, like facebook and google do, but the hyperlinks themselves are fine
I don't have much info on the filtering requirements on article 13, but I have not seen any proof or documentation that says it will censor content, or affect memes in any way, besides the echo chamber
These types of filters would required an unimaginable amounts of computing powers, on par if not greater than Google itself
In all likelihood they'll put a filtering system on the filter, where if your IP is not from the E.U. the filter would give you an auto-pass
Alde is the only bigger party to vote majority against this proposal as well as the greens
>Then they wouldn't be required
Yes they would
The exception is for small sites, not for everyone
The rest would need Big Tech to scan the content
Yes, this is clearly a direct prerogative and not a vague, wishy-washy line that governments just put and ignore
Forget this map
That the US is more dangerous than Europe was obvious without statistics
But the US is more dangerous than a lot more countries, which will surprise people
Someone should make a the same map but for different underdeveloped and autocratic countries
For example, all of these countries also have a lower rate of intentional homicide than the US:
China, Iran, Syria, Libya, Sierra Leone, Lebanon, Tunisia, Kyrgyzstan, Turkey, Rwanda, Kenya, Somalia, Morocco, Egypt, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and even god damn North Korea
The US is actually in the bottom half in the world in this dataset
More countries have a lower, rather than a higher murder rate compared to the US
Zoom in and you will actually see its very dark red

>and cause moderate inflation
Inflation was already at 4
3% in 2008, 1
7% in 2009, 4
7% in 2010 and 3
1% in 2011
How much more moderate would you make it by printing money
Every summer I wonder how is Spain possible
fuuucking I was really enjoying the cool and rainy summer I've been having here in Germany
Begone heat
It is already 34 here in BG and it is already above my threshold
Anything above will make me want to die and I know that in Aug and Sep it is going to get even worse
Send help because I don't have AC at home and the one in my car doesn't work
Oh for fuck sake
At least we're not like south Spain
HELP
What's up with Ukraine lmao
I think if you have countries like Morocco and Algeria, then you should have all the countries in Northern Africa
They
Have
An APP
It guides people to threes that needs felling
Meanwhile my country has over 50% illegal barbarian deforestation
I'll be in my bunk
Very true words
I'm from Bulgaria and combined with the pro-Russia, anti EU sentiment some paid outlets harbour, there's the issue with our seaside basically being sold off to Russians
You won't believe how many Russians visit the sea each year and how many have properties
There are whole apartment complexes that are closed and for Russians, only
We can totally imagine Putin saying one day he has to save the mistreated fellow citizens in BG
Oh God
What happened
And here I thought the Germans were good at everything
Kawaii of the highest level
>Stalin actually had a mental breakdown for a few months after the invasion, he did not issue any orders which led to chaos at the front and only sped up the German advance
Not a few months, less than two weeks actually
He wasn't visited by generals but by members of the Politburo
And him not issuing any orders whatsoever in that period is a myth, AFAIK
Ironically, Stalin was absolutely right that the invasion was a very stupid idea for Germany
But still, he should have been more prepared, it's not like the Germans would have any leg to stand on if he had moved more troops to the border areas as their own troops were massed in Poland
And the Japanese invading from the east would have been the biggest logistical nightmare of all time (for the invaders), there was no practical reason for committing hundreds of thousand of troops for the defense of Siberia with the Germans being a much more obvious threat
[One million seems to be an enormous exaggeration]
Pretty much the reason neither Germany, nor Russia have recovered from these wars demographically even to this day
Losses like that create generational holes that can never be filled
Russia alone would have probably had a population of more than 200 million nowadays if it wasn't for the brutal losses
Europe's population as a whole would easily have crossed a billion people if it wasn't for the two world wars and the horrific consequences they had for our demography
It's honestly staggering how many people died, and how many weren't even born as a result of that
He made a famous speech on July 3rd, about two weeks after the start of the invasion
This made some historians claim he did nothing but hide before that but new evidence suggests that this is a myth
>Also famously a septic tank one time
Holy shit
Meanwhile, their northern neighbour Bulgaria fucked off all the way to the right
Also worth mentioning, if you zoom in you will notice that by far the larger part of people is between 20 and 35 years old
Gives me so much hope for my country
Spread the word that half my country doesn't have a working brain
big bang from geshev - fabricated audio tapes haha
Here's the deal, things are so fucked up that any new party that comes in power will undoubtedly be as worse as Borisov
But borisov has to go, 10 years is more than enough for you, snake
I fucking love my country
You have all my support from America
If anyone had any brain cells would know that these protests were initiated and paid by the oligarchs they arrested, prosecuted and gotten rid of in the past years
People can't even give a proper answer why they are protesting when interviewed by the media
They want change but change won't come from the leftists, only destruction
Elections are in a couple months
Yeah it's kinda sad
hopefully the outdoor nature of the protests will reduce the damage somewhat
Personally I try to improve my odds of not getting the plague by:
\- always wearing my N95 mask
\- going there by bike, and using the bulky bike frame as a barrier to help me keep my distance from others
\- trying to move towards parts of the crowd where more people wear masks
We did, but we didn't expect things to go this bad
Lol, you like the hat DPS gave you
True
It's good beer
That may actually be a terrible idea
As soon as something happens that reduces agricultural output (like crop failure or trade disruptions that cause food to rot before it could reach its destination) we'd have people starving
Overproduction is actually a pretty logical practice,  although it obviously has environmental drawbacks
No I'm  saying that a system where nobody starves and food is wasted may be better than  a  system where nobody starves and nothing is wasted, because the second   has no room for mistakes or disasters
I don't think you're getting anything
This is a comparison between hypothetical situations and which one we should be trying to reach
Ok, I think so too except your comment that I originally responded to  said the ideal was for everyone to be fed and for nothing to be wasted so I just pointed how the "nothing wasted" part may not be as good as it intuitively sounds to us
That was all
Of course I think the ideal is for everyone to be fed
You haven't been to Bulgaria, have you
I have, if after an hour of driving on highway your kidney stones haven't broken, it's a good highway for Bulgarian standards
In Bulgaria we watch Home alone thruought the whole month
Yeah, same in Bulgaria
Just a modern Balkan tradition
Cool
So what now
Where can I see who voted for what
Thank you
Wow wtf, even a little shipka monument and nevsky cathedral
Very nice
Some from Bulgaria that I noticed:
Alexander Nevski cathedral where Sofia is
The Nessebar windmill on the black sea coast
Rose valley in Thrace
Maybe now we can have animu movies in cinemas
In Bulgaria it's around 25, maybe a bit lower
Edit: But my classes have always been at around 28
In Bulgaria in my class there are 30 students
I’d say it’s 28-32 in Bulgaria
In Bulgaria that number would be around 25-27 if I can judge by my own experience
I've been in classes as small as 23 and as big as 30
>We have a shortage of teachers because the pay is so low and the job is so hard
I can confirm this
I'm a teacher by university degree, but I'm typing this from an office
I don't dislike the idea of being a teacher, but it's a lot of work for not a lot of money
Actually at the moment I make somewhat less money as opposed to if I had followed my original profession, but my current job is also a 100 times less stressful and less demanding than teaching kids about literature
And from my entire course of people (we had 24 graduates) I don't think anyone became a teacher after graduation - even this one girl we had who was supper diligent and both her parents were teachers as well
We don't keep in touch much, but I know where most of the best from our course are and neither of them is a teacher right now
So do part-time teaching, but that's about it
PS: Also, at the company I work, a lot of my colleagues are teachers by degree
I can think of at least 5 colleagues off the top of my head
My high school class was unusually big - 32 kids
Some rooms didn't have enough desks for all of us
As for primary, etc we usually floated between 20-25
Generally, I know that classes in primary school have been shrinking over the last 10 years, for example my little brother's class was 21-22 people, but when I was in primary school we were 27-28, in any case no less than 25
In my highschool there were classes with 30 people, my class had 29 in 8th grade, then it shrunk to 28, because a girl switched schools and left, then for some time we were 29 again, because they moved some dude from another class into our class, but later he was moved to another school and we remained 28 until the end
And this is all in State-run schools
>it's a lot of work for not a lot of money
Well what do you expect
The Bulgarian education system is an absolute joke
It's ridiculous how much time and money is being wasted to the detriment of young people across the country
After 12 years of this circus who in their right mind would want to stay in a school
I'm not sure if this is a regional/cultural thing or just some schools, but in my experience of our education system it felt like literally nobody ( not the students, and so not the teachers ) gave a damn about anything
This continued in university where they just screwed with you instead
&#x200B;
Looking back on that, i'm rather salty that the system is only concerned with dumping large masses of information in a compacted time frame rather than trying to optimize for comprehension of the material
And that compounds when it's coupled to previous information like for example you'd get with math
So as a result, you never learn to learn as it's all about memorizing the current relevant set of information as a standalone thing briefly, and then never use it again
Retrospectively, I can EASILY call the majority of the time i've spent in high school absolutely wasted
&#x200B;
So, what i'm trying to say is : Good, the system is rotten and you probably wouldn't affect it much, so keep your health and dont go near that trainwreck
It's not only that
As a teacher you can't really impose discipline anymore
When I was a kid if I disobeyed the teacher I'd either eat a slap or they tell my parents who would slap me at home
Now parents don't discipline their kids at home and the only tool the teacher has is giving bad grades, at which the kids scoff
Out of the 45 mins of a class 30 go towards beast taming and bargaining with a bunch of brats that don't respect anything about learning
And the last 15 are for trying to cram information in their heads
It's not just the education system
Parent's don't know how to do their own jobs as parents
Imo the system should be revamped a little bit like this:
Elementary school - You set the basics
Mathematics, languages, science, some arts
Middle school - You build a little bit more on the basics and teachers start to keep an eye on every student - in which subjects they are lacking and at which they are good
High school - Students go to special classes tailored for their particular skills and start preparing for the university
Students that are not good mathematics shouldn't learn complex geometry for instance
And those who are not good with languages shouldn't be forced into them
High school should focus on the student's individual abilities in the fields they are best at
Edit: You can keep some basic stuff in HS, maybe some algebra and Bulgarian for all, just to keep the material fresh, but the focus should be on the individual skills of the students
It doesn't matter if they respect learning because they're NOT learning
Learning is the absolute last thing our system is designed for
You can't force teenagers to spend 7 hours a day craming worthless garbage in 12 different subjects with no real use and expect them to care
Around 10-12 grade even the most well-behaved students in the best school in the oblast were fed up
And hitting them isn't discipline
>You can't force teenagers to spend 7 hours a day craming worthless  garbage in 12 different subjects with no real use and expect them to  care
There are some subjects that are an absolute must and which you cannot cut tho like: Bulgarian language
basic mathematics, basic science, Bulgarian history and basic human history, a foreign language (English to be exact)
Sure, there are some subjects that can absolutely be cut (like the second foreign language classes or IT)
A university course and self teaching will give you a lot more information on IT than a few vague classes in school
Music and art should also be only for specialized schools that focus on gifted kids
One good system is to use high school to focus on the individual skill of every student and tone down the other subjects like: Student has shown better grades or just general interest in mathematics during elementary and middle school and worse grades/less interest in languages
Then in high school that student should have more math and less languages - for example
But my point still stands
Children today have no incentive to learn
There is no detriment to not learning, and there is no discipline
Bulgarian language and basic mathematics should of course be taught, but literature should not he mandatory, and students are forced  to learn far more than basic math currently, even if it's completely useless to them
IT should be focused on more, not everyone goes to college
History and religion also have no place from  grades 1 to 4
They're there to instill nationalism and loyalty to the state, no other reason
There's no such thing as "basic science" in the Bulgarian education system
I agree students should learn what interests them Our current system uses technical and professional high schools but still have to learn all mandatory subjects
It's completely contradictory makes the whole thing pointless
As for your last point, you're forgetting they also have no *incentive* to learn, either
90% of the material is useless filler from communist times
Grades 1-4 are bloated
5-7 are mostly useless and high school is a disorganized mess with no clear goal or purpose
Literature should be mandatory because the culture of our civilization is kept in literature, and not just Bulgarian literature, but literature in general - Homer's works, Don Quixote, Shakespeare etc
They are important, but they are not suited for all ages
Young children shouldn't learn them, but teens should
Also literature is what makes a language a language
Without it the language is just a communication code
> IT should be focused on more, not everyone goes to college
But not everyone is good with IT either
Kids these days are computer-literate enough to handle themselves
Still special courses that help to those interested should exist
Now, as to if you want to be a programmer, well you'd better go to college
Especially college in Bulgaria is ridiculously cheap
You really don't have an excuse for not going unless there is a special issue preventing you from it
Religion - Yeah, that has no place in schools
I say this a a believer
History - Depends
I see your point and maybe you are right
Like grades 1-2 kids won't even comprehend something as complex as a nation's history, but grades 3-4 you should at least start to build it
However don't start with BG history but human prehistoric history, then the Ancient world etc
Actually in the teaching courses for the classes the history classes and literature classes do follow the same path
I think for instance in the 8th (can't remember) grade kids were supposed to start the year with the works of Homer and then move on to Bulgarian medieval literature
And the history classes from the same year also explored the same periods
So literature and history were meant to help each other out
And while the kids are learning about pre-history you should start teaching them about evolution in science classes (maybe the yearly program from MON is already like that, I haven't checked it in a couple of years)
> 90% of the material is useless filler from communist times
Like what
When I was a student we never even learned about communism in history class
Which a shame we skipped a big chunk of important history
Maybe today they teach it
My point is the basics have to be taught always, but once in high school focus should be put on the best subjects for each individual student
And literature should be mandatory
You can't have kids not knowing Botev or Shakespeare or Don Quixote
>Like what
When I was a student we never even learned about communism in history class
We learn about communism extensively in history class and there's no problem with that
It's history after all
I'm talking about the way the curriculum itself was built around the needs of the state at the time
Physics classes spend 3 years teaching us about electric grids in order to create a large pool of disposable engineers
Scientific subjects like Chemistry and Biology aren't taught in 12 grade but Physics is and it feels forced
And what do we learn
Space so they could rile up support for giving money for the (then) space race and 2
nuclear reactors because they were building Kozluduy
Cus if your citizens are dirt poor you better convince them that spending money on large projects instead of feeding them is a good thing
Same reason why the BEL exam is mandatory
To force a singular Bulgarian identity and make people love the country which is just codeword for the ruling regime (BKP at the time)
Yes, literature is important, but it shouldn't be mandatory
Most of it is pure nationalism (Botev) and only alienates young people because these values don't work in a modern context and can be downright dangerous
It only serves to make young people hate reading
Sure, not everyone, but not enough to warrant forcing it on everyone
As for IT, yes, you'd expect most to have a working knowledge of computers, but most young people use smartphones nowadays and I've definitely noticed that only certain demographics (gamers, programmers etc
) can actually do more than open a browser or make a presentation
Also, if you filter out most of the (subjectively) useless stuff you definitely have enough time for an IT course
>Same reason why the BEL exam is mandatory
To force a singular Bulgarian identity and make people love the country which is just codeword for the ruling regime (BKP at the time)
BEL exam is mandatory so you could prove you're not illiterate
Arguably mathematics should also be mandatory to prove you know algebra at least
>Physics classes spend 3 years teaching us about electric grids in order to create a large pool of disposable engineers
Well we kinda need engineers now
Sadly everyone is going for fancy degrees now like marketing, economics and psychology
All professions the state doesn't need and for whom there's little work
>Most of it is pure nationalism (Botev) and only alienates young people because these values don't work in a modern context and can be downright dangerous
It only serves to make young people hate reading
Sure, not everyone, but not enough to warrant forcing it on everyone
Sure he's controversial (he was a communist as well) but you have to learn how read beyond that and judge it as according to the times he lived in as opposed to the times we live in now
He was a major figure in Bulgarian history which should not be ignored
Once you start judging literature with the eyes of modern times you end up with stupid decisions like banning Mark Twain books because he uses the n-word
And lastly there are some classics that children simply must read
If we let children pick their own books for literature class we'll have a class discussion on "50 shades of Grey
" Exaggeration
Nah, I was on a train to Plovdiv a few years ago where a group of 14 year-olds were lively discussing it
I cringed a little but at least they were reading something
And I agree some books require a certain age
I was able to appreciate  "Under The Yoke" only once I entered university
As fo IT that suffers from the negative connotation that that's basically not a real class
When we had IT at school we just played ConQUIZtador - which was actually very educational
And as for when I had to make presentations for class I just searched in YouTube "How to make a presentation" or "How to edit
" or "Photo Shop Tutorial". You really don't need an IT class as long as you know English and YouTube
>BEL exam is mandatory so you could prove you're not illiterate
Well, if they managed to reach 12th grade, you'd expect them to at least be literate
That's the Bulgarian language part
The literary part has no purpose anymore
>Sadly everyone is going for fancy degrees now like marketing, economics and psychology
All professions the state doesn't need and for whom there's little work
Developed economies rely on the tertiary and quaternary sectors, so these degrees definitely have value for a country in the long run
>judge it as according to the times he lived in as opposed to the times we live in now
Therein lies the problem
I've yet to see a literature teacher who didn't apply these authors' vision to the modern world
I didn't intend to single out Botev, he's just the most prominent example of a revolution era writer whose work can be summed up as "Love thy country or be ashamed".    I'm an avid reader of history and politics
This line of thinking never ends well
>As fo IT that suffers from the negative connotation that that's basically not a real class
We probably spent 3 years learning what a mouse and keyboard is
All stereotypes have a grain of truth in them I suppose
>You really don't need an IT class as long as you know English and YouTube
Well, yes, but all the good English teachers realised long ago that they'd make more money as private tutors
(BTW your English is impeccable)
> Well, if they managed to reach 12th grade, you'd expect them to at least be literate
Oh, you'd be surprised how many students graduate with pretty poor grammar, but that's another story
As for Botev, I won't argue anymore
He was never my favorite anyway
I too dislike his hard nationalism
I don't like his super macho style of writing as well
I've had some literature professors tell me about Botev something along the line of: "Thank goodness he died before the liberation because had he survived he'd probably end up with a tarnished legacy
" And I agree
With his views he would have probably ended up like Stambolov - hero to some, villain to others and likely assassinated
Or as Harvey Dent said it " *You either die* a h*ero*, or y*ou live long enough* to s*ee yourself become* *the* v*illain*”. Well Botev died a hero
We have a lot more appealing poets than him in my opinion, like Vaptsarov
He might have been a communist but his style is simple yet beautiful
> (BTW your English is impeccable)
Thank you
It means those 5 years in the university (degree in Bulgarian and English) and before that 7 years of watching Cartoon Network as a kid weren't a waste of time
>Thank goodness he died before the liberation because had he survived he'd probably end up with a tarnished legacy
It's surprising to how many highly regarded historical figures this applies
I wonder if Levski would be so idolised today if he had lived long enough to get in the monarchy's way with his republican ideals
>Cartoon Network
Ah, yes, my favourite "educational" channel growing up
I remember constantly playing a PC game about them when I was a kid
Whole of Europe I would imagine
I remember when the first private national-wide channel in Bulgaria BTV lunched in 2000 and they were showing some Asterix and Obelix animations all day long
Good shit
Pretty sure the answer is "Everyone".
Hard  to believe this picture is real lol
Everything comes down to malevolent election interference by Russia
Unless Europe addresses that it will have to deal with more and more illogical politicians with self-destructive tendencies as heads of governments, as opposition leaders, as members of EP
> If they were still on the Drachma instead of the Euro there'd be more options available to reduce debt pressure
Yup, massive devaluation, Venezuela style
I don't think that would be better
Maybe a Venezuela scenario is exaggerated
But let's look at Turkey, similar in development and probably more diverse in exports - their currency has plunged 50% in a year, and the worst is still (probably) yet to come
The average salary in Turkey is now similar to that in Ukraine
Would you be happy if that happened in Greece
To be honest even now I can't tell if the standard is British English or US English
I think OP is just making a pun/reference
Allow me to explain
Cyberpunk is a term used to describe a specific form of science fiction
However in this particular instance I think OP is just making a reference to Cyberpunk 2077
If you're not aware what CP 2077 is, it's a highly anticipated futuristic video game that is being developed by CD Project Red
And if you're not familiar with CDPR, they are a game development studio from Warsaw and actually have a very good, rock solid reputation among the gaming community
You ever go back home from school alive just to flex on those Americans

Hello from the other side ... of the box
Wonder where rich people live nowadays
I thought the picture was perfect and then I saw the cat and that made it even better
Could have been photo of my grandma as well :)
just the cat is different color

I'd love to go to Uni there but most of their public universities don't seem to have Bachelors taught in English
So today I learned that having any sort of semi functioning social system means communism
good stuff
Stallone's fake Bulgarian passport found in a recent counterfeit bust in Bulgaria
It was used as a sample that counterfeiters show to the clients
I always knew rocky was one of us
technicaly,we do have a Stallone double in bulgaria
Heck yeah
It's a sample they show potential customers
The whole point is that everyone can tell it's not real, but at the same time looks real
Guess which party was caught running a corruption ring for selling  actual legitimate Bulgarian passports
That's right, the "patriotic, Bulgarian values" party
Of course, no consequences, they are part of the ruling coalition after all
Damn, I'm angry
I believe the second expendables was filmed there
And the team as a whole
And Mexico borders Texas but you can still picture the stereotypical cowboy and the stereotypical Mexican and they're nothing alike
Wow I didn’t know that
At the risk of revealing personal info, I know people that were extras in a straight to DVD Morgan Freeman movie that was filmed there
Shows that you haven't paid attention in [history classes]
Also, the brand Bulgari derives its name from, you guessed it, the Bulgarian ancestry of its creators
Also, cowboys and Mexicans could be much more alike than you like to imagine, outside of the movies
Haha, yep
They were a bunch of funny characters
Being a Bulgarian going to Carpathians, I thought I'm just going to see something very similar to Bulgarian mountains as is with most things being almost identical in terms of culture, nature and cities between our countries
Let me tell you it's totally different
Bulgarian mountains are amazing and looking massive as hell but the Carpathians are so much more edgy and feel a bit like the Alps
Transylvania and the Carpathians are an awesome site to visit and hike
Make sure you go there
I thought on posting it on r/MapPorn, but I realised someone could really create „porn“ with this
You messed up Macedonia's flag, but I don't really care, bc I hate them
Happy independence day Suomi
Definitely one of the first places on my list to visit eventually
Finland just seems cool
P.S: You are better than the Netherlands
That's for constantly blocking us from Schengen
So yeah Finland is better
And we beat you at football
And we aren't buying tulips

WE HAVE MOUNTAINS
Trump should try to find a parking spot for an American truck literally anywhere in Europe
Also when you produce cars that consume 40 l/100km you can't expect good sales in a market that enforces high taxes on fuel
Trump is a wizard
He looks like he is about to start a trade war with basically the world and got us arguing about cars
Magic
Tesla is still an up an coming company
Their market share is pretty small even in the US
Don't get me wrong, if I had the money I would probably drive a Tesla
Buy I doubt Tesla is what Trump has in mind
My point is that there are huge differences in the markets
You can make a car for the European market and it will also fit in the American
The other way around is not straight forward
Simple example is: I can go to America and most likely will not have a problem driving an average rental car
An American comes to Europe and they need to actually request a type of rental car they are comfortable with (I.e automatic transmission, a bit bigger, etc)
Did the French leave Europe while nobody was looking
A friend of mine has an American boyfriend and when his parents come to visit, they find the small cars quite uncomfortable
Granted they are from Texas but still
They also found the parking spaces pretty small
It's nice and clean but is it just me or does it look like a terrible place to actually read
My friends' grandfather would eat his meals super fast, in seconds
He survived two WWs physically, but mentally it was something else
I thought that's a Muslim before I read the caption
It didn't make much sense lol
I support this
If they want to sanction France, Europe should sanction them
> Unless you of course think that calls for boycotts validate sanctions
I do, they're the same things basically
Only Muslim  countries get to avoid WTO penalties and act like nothing had happened if things normalise
Well Europe should react
China does  incomparably worse stuff to them and Muslim leaders sing it praises despite China not even being as relevant for their investments as Europe is
I guess the difference is they know China would swing the hammer if they acted this way
China doesn't just put Muslims into concentration camps (as if that's not the most horrible part) but it tries to suppress Islam on every front
Besides Muslim countries haven't complained only of Muhammad drawings
Erdogan raises his tone and flings insults for just about anything including things that didn't even happen
And his supporters follow his lead and hate Europe for it
There's definitely a contrast between what Europe and China do and who Muslim leaders criticise
Dude China has done a laundry list of things to infringe on the rights of Uyghurs and to a lesser extent other religious minorities
Whether you think you could possibly justify them, my point is Muslim leaders, some of which are real snowflakes, have a lot of reasons to be angry with what China is doing
But they're not which shows their hypocrisy and how they don't really stand for the things they say they stand for
>Since Turkey has been fuming at China non stop
I could be wrong but from what I've heard Erdogan has mellowed his tone a lot towards  China recently
> Muslim leaders have been to these camps
You think they believe you guys who bomb them all the time
Ahahaha
I think they don't give a crap just like every religious hypocrite in history hasn't. Christianity says it preaches love, Islam says it preaches peace, meanwhile all they do is murder people by the millions
And the corrupt leaders of dictatorships are the last people to actually care about people's lives
China pays them and makes it conditional on them shutting their mouths so that's what they do
einz, hier kommt die sonne
Don't be a shitty loser
Damn, Turkey, what the hell
Wow that's abysmal and depressing
It’s clear the UK is going down the hill sharply
Watch the movie Brexit to see how it all unfolded
It’s sad to see the mass brainwashed
Would be glad if we build stronger protections on how our data is harvested and used against us as it can happen in more countries without definite action
We don’t want this , most of the Uk doesn’t want this
Ahh
the EU has to make it hard for the UK to leave so the rest of the EU states don't get ideas or otherwise everyone would want to leave
The fact is EVERYTHING has been rejected by parliament, so if the EU wants a deal, it needs to offer a bunch of unicorns
Happy birthday, Romania
From your southern neighbours, Bulgaria
We need to go in the streets, emails and upvotes are easily ignored
It's not like they don't know this is hugely unpopular
It's not the first time the EC has tried to pass bullshit copyright laws either
We need some massive protests against the ideas the EU is pushing in regards to internet copyright and censorship
I love them soft boiled with a bit of paprika
We keep eggs in the cold isles in Easter Europe, too
At least in Bulgaria and Greece
Americans may've invaded a place or two or ten, but occupation, no, don't think so
Imagine the view from up there
Juxtaposition with that building there on the picture is just perfect
I mean it's small, but netherland in translation means low lands
Don't click, it's better as Batman
> lots of small (between 1000 and 3000) villages
These are actually *big* villages
More Brits have heard of Bulgaria than Ireland
Those are definetly trolls
There is no way they dont know the one country they have a border with
Fingols mad
It's probably because very few people know anything about estonia to have an opinion on it
While Bulgaria is Sunny Beach and English pensioner's retirement home
I think Bulgaria might be because of the large number of British tourists that come
A lot of people have either been in Bulgaria or know someone that has
I hate that place
>but still refuse to learn the language of their country just because of their bullshit ancestry
What's the problem with them not learning Romanian
How does that harm anyone but themselves
Or perhaps (judging by your hatred of them having their own schools and signage in Hungarian) the problem is that they haven't stopped speaking Hungarian
We mostly export our power to neighboring countries
We export so much that at some places we have to import power from other countries too, because of corruption
We also have zero plans to phase out coal outside this GIF
I mean we could have made some commitment without reading the text but there is no plan
Well maybe, problem is our electricity bills (from what I know) are much higher than our neighbours, which considering how much we produce should be te opposite
Axis 2 Electric boogaloo
Reminds of me this gem: "A German court has ruled against deportation of refugees to Bulgaria if they had been registered there first upon entering the European Union because Bulgaria wasn’t a safe country of origin
\>  A German court refuses to extradite a German citizen
A country declines to extradite it's own citizen
Isn't this standard
Yeah it really sucks
In theory internal extraditions should be a good tool to fight crime as even petty thiefs are international with open borders
If it's a more serious crime sure, but I'm thinking more along the lines of a Bulgarian pick pocket getting identified in Germany but escaping back to Bulgaria before being arrested
If they are arrested in Bulgaria and sent back to Germany there is a good chance victims will testify and they will be convicted
If the trial is in Bulgaria I'm thinking few people would bother just to testify how they lost a wallet with €50 and the thief is acquitted
There is a lot of international petty crime these days where the location of the trial will make a difference because the people involved would be too inconvenienced
Bulgaria and it's a leading news story in all media every single day
Fuck Summer
Way too hot
When Finland has higher temperatures than Hungary
Im still waiting for the real summer here in Bulgaria
10C is perfection tbh
Shout-out to the EU
Idk about the others but no way Italians or the French have such high percentages
I call bullshit
One of these is not like the others
I feel this proves that one good thing came out of the Soviet occupation of eastern Europe, literacy
Guess I'm a robot for getting annoyed by the cookie banners/pop-ups
Slava Romania and the Romanian people
A Bulgarian here, we're still trying to fight too and honestly the progress has been slow
Though we are on our way to slowly ridding the government from these scum, we only need a strong and capable leader to take up the job and fasten the process
Good luck in the fight brothers
Don't go easy on them
This is some fairytale shit
Veliko Tarnovo on steroids
So like the french pronunciation of croissant but with a "sch" instead
I was joking
Fucking Soros ruining the beautiful Hungarian beaches too
You could say there's lodz of snow
OKe I'm out
I get that these engines are better in that they don't steal your data but I've yet to find one as good as Google at finding the result I'm looking for
There's something quite funny about the only language with a Slavic derived word for snow being Romanian :D
Pretty much all slavic countries say "снег" except Bulgaria where it's "сняг" bulgarians don't give a shit do they
>10 years for 10km autobahn etc
So it's not only us then
this gives me hope
Tories take credit for EU directive
This is why Britain voted out really - their politicians take credit for all the positives while projecting their screw ups on the EU
> That doesn't excuse the stupidity and gullibility of the voters, the individuals
Why are there so many stupid and gullible people here is another question
Ughh, the biggest problem of all
Not just in Britain or the US but in my country as well
Things would be so much better if it weren't for so many voters being gullible and stupid
Ew it looks discusting how can somone drink sausage
That looks like the drink of dreams
I approve
Why is it OK to insult millions of people who speak slavic language
Why has the word ''Slav'' become a synoynum for an uncivilized thug
So someone in Poland does something, and now ALL Slavic speakers are guilty
SLAVIC is A language family, NOT ethnic group
When someone in Romania does something stupid, where are the ''Latin'' memes
I feel ashamed :(
It's a huge luxury as stated above
If you DO travel its reserve the tickets 6+ months early at least and keep a very tight budget until then
Happy independence day Latvia
May there be many potatoes upon you
The mass exodus of Turks
In an attempt for our government to "unite" the nation in 1984 they forced all Bulgarian Turks (total about 10% of Bulgarian population) to change their names to Bulgarian-sounding one, they forbid traditional clothing and public muslim rituals
Imagine your government *forcing you to change your own name you've had all your life*. Of course, as a direct result many Bulgarian Turks  left en masse - about 300 000 (out of 800 000) left for Turkey
Maybe half of them returned later but those are impossible to estimate correctly
It was a human rights and a demographic catastrophe
Bulgaria is known to have saved its jews in WWII
However it is not often said that the Macedonian jews didn't have such luck and those who were saved were stripped of their properties and money
here in bulgaria we treat turkish immigrants like animals
> Do Turks in Bulgaria now have all Bulgarian names
No, they were allowed to change them back after communism fell
Most of them did
They make a remembrance of those events every year as far as I know
yeah but i dont get why were still pissed bout the ottomans, turks and ottomans are very didferent and there is no point in shaming the turks coz of their ancestors
My flair
No hard feeling towards any neighbor, but I love warm, salty seas
At first look Greece is a good pick, as this gives a lot of Mediterranean shore, but going for Turkey will make the whole Black sea part of the Mediterranean, besides the additional seashore
Now I notice that the title says EU, so Greece after all, maybe
Stay away from the Balkans MF
Not on EU, but nevertheless this will have profound effects on global politics, climate and what not
Unless it's only the European part, in which case it's will still have huge impact on global politics, but no so much on global climate (maybe)
That's actually interesting question for geography nuts - what is the impact on global climate if some country were water - Russia being the largest by a hefty margin would probably have the biggest impact
just swim l0l
I thought that's the point of what ifs
Don't know about first, but we do have the most free paid days for mothers that just went out of labour successfully
Something like two years
In Bulgaria mothers are the most important
I remember reading that we used to have some of the best maternity leave in the world - two years paid, first year paid in full
I think they changed this to only one year now but I still think that's pretty good, especially comparing to some more developed countries than only offer a few weeks at best
Booking flights to Switzerland
Didn't you guys have some more really good early social laws
Something about female equality I think
Completely forgot what it was
Idk, it's not that easy, otherwise I would apply this picosecond for it
That's almost like a primitive UBI
Nice
Someone else said Portugal was first idk
No, this is just a fun thread on reddit
Why are so many Germans going politically to the right
Try some suicidal depression and tell me then if you still think that way about physically healthy people with depression wanting euthanasia
Legalised euthanasia
In the Netherlands
Where
And how do I sign up
Bolsheviks or the other parties
Wasn't 1920 before the purges
You still had mensheviks and socialist revolutionaries (the actual people that caused the Russian revolution)
I thought Bolsheviks were only in power from the civil war onwards
I didn't know this 100 bucks was to replace parent leave
7 months only
That's insane
I don't understand this, the baby needs a parent during these crucial developing first two years
So sad we have to sacrifice this to make a profit for some company
Een volk een rijk
It's easy to understand, listen
Imagine being in a wheelchair for reasons out of your control
Wouldn't you want to be able to do most things other people can do
Easy access to buildings for example
Wouldn't it be good if those that can walk give 0
0000001% of their tax so you can be normal
Now imagine you're born with a gash between your legs that bleeds every month
Regardless of your income, it's out of your control
So a man perfectly equal to you in every other way pays a certain amount less than you and gains an undeserved benefit over you
Why am I asking that
The rest of the world hasn't forgotten Germanies past
We love you guys now, but we're keeping an eye on you just in case :P
Thank you
Oh :(
Ah shit yeah, that's right
The bolshevik revolution of 1918 put the mensheviks and SR's in jail right
Oh well
Would be "een leider"
You already pay for that free access if we're talking about the wheelchairs
And my prior point I think you went out of your way to not understand it
Saying I'm equating women to handicapped people
And that that is insulting to women because
handicapped people eww
Has everybody lost their minds
What's with the hair by the way
Each country has one crazy haired blond person who's ready to fuck up the country
Trump and Boris have been successful at this
In the Netherlands we still have Geert Wilders, in France we still have Marine Le Pen and in Bulgaria we had Volen Siderov
They all have crazy blond hair
Bulgaria
starting the second Balkan war because they were not happy with what we got from the first Balkan war
And then losing everything we got from the first Balkan war
Yup
We were idiots
Sorry for what my ancestors did my Balkan brotha
An old grandfather lives in the middle of nowhere in a place that doesn’t even have a name
His granddaughter grew up poor in the 90s (no indoor plumbing in her early days) but her parents do alright now
Her grandfather still doesn’t have indoor plumbing, doesn’t drive a car
He is a subsistence farmer on a crumbling property and lives in 2 rooms
His pension is a joke
If he didn’t have family to help support him, he wouldn’t be able to pay his bills
His house is heated by a wood burning stove- electric heat is too expensive
He’s relatively healthy and has a family to help support him but has lived a hard life
He still works hard every day
Winters are the worst because he’s very isolated and gets completely cut off from the outside world
His son vows to buy a cheap 4x4 to be able to go up there and check on him
He refuses to live with them during the winters because he doesn’t want to be a burden
He’s one of the lucky ones because many people his age, both in the country and in the cities, have basically been abandoned by their family or have nobody left to care for them
Many villages disappear every year because the young people either go to the bigger cities or work abroad because there’s no money to be made in the villages and the elderly don’t usually live to a ripe old age
Bulgaria is a beautiful country and I admire the resilience and fortitude of the people here
They make everything last instead of replacing things when they break
Many people have “gardens” (Americans would call these farms since they’re not small) that yield lots of produce for the whole family
A lot of veg is pickled so it can be eaten in the winter months
These people know how to sustain themselves in tough times
Even though every home in the village has access to affordable fiber optic internet and almost everyone has a smartphone these days, people who are 40+ who remember life under communism do not rely on these things the same way the younger generations do
If our modern society were to fall apart tomorrow, these people would be prepared to handle it
I forget some words in Bulgarian that have a shorter or better sound in English
My office speaks in this weird Bulgaro-Franco-English mix it’s hard sometimes
With 100% confidence i can say im better at english than bulgarian
I hate "Natasha and Boris accent" and can't help but judge people who have it
I like mine though, it's not typical Russian accent, usually people think that I'm somewhere from northern/central Europe
The thing that I hate about how I speak is that I make typical Russian mistakes - for example, I still mix up a/the a lot
Hell yeah
Having a hard slavic accent is so comfortable for me to speak and I believe it sounds cooler rather than trying to fake a British accent which kinda makes me choke and spit
The Dutch have hands down the worst English accent
Because of it and the cool "Russian" connotation our accent has I don't feel too bad about ours
I don't like it honestly, sometimes i have to repeat multiple times for native english speakers to understand me and it really hurts my dignity
Well I've lived half of my life abroad, so my accent doesn't sound anything like the eastern European one
In Russian there are no such concept as articles or anything even remotely similar
So for me it's very foreign thing - I know basic rule but I have zero inner feeling of the concept
I was considering getting an iPhone
The same model was overpriced by about 400 euros in our local Apple store
It literally costs *thousands* of leva (our currency), more than an average salary, by far
The last part is always the most important
Damn everybody comparing their cities to Detroit
Didn't know the home of D12 was that bad
I loved my three years in Glasgow
Wouldn't live there forever but that applies for the whole of UK
If I have to though - I'll definitely choose Scotland and possibly Glasgow again
If the choice was between Malmö and Stockholm or Gothenburg that is an easy one, don't go one of the latter two
But if it is to go or not to go, then go
I lived there for an year and a half and I have to say there are some things to see, it is by the sea which gives bonus points and I like the general calmness that the city brings to it's citizens
And sorry to say it, don't bash me with stones, Swedes, but Copenhagen is 20 minutes with a train so that's a huge plus, because Copenhagen is gorgeous
Edit: missing word
Probably the stereotypical average office worker who is never satisfied and is always looking at their options, trying to get the most out of every interested party
"Oh, the EU office gives me good benefits, but look, the Russian office has a great deal from me if only I put in a good word for them at the next staff meeting
And, hey, the China office does some amazing work if only I let one or two little (big) companies be bought by them
Oh, look, that nice Greek colleague has some problems with the Turkish office, I think I'll cozy up to the Turkish office in order to not let any problems fuck up my desk, morals be damned
Wait, what
The EU office is giving more benefits
I DEMAND MORE BENEFITS
The guy that does nothing and almost no one talks to them, but he asks for money
We would be the IT department that everybody forgot existed

The janitors / dustmen / dishwashers, the low-paid undesirable jobs
The guy who collects all the garbage
We work as the lousy security guard
Bulgaria
It's one month here
Yes, sure
That's like the norm
We shall call it Euro English (especially after Brexit)
A single coffee is like a liter and yet there's barely any coffee in it
More embezzling here
Apparently some random company nobody knows about that has a revenue of 500 euro got a loan of 30+ mil euro by the Bulgarian Development Bank
It got the media's attention though and the management has since been sacked
Yeah but this shit is normal by now
What would far-left mean in terms of Spanish affairs
Sorry if it's a bit ignorant
I mean, you guys are pretty good at it too
Real recognizes real and all that
Yep, we produce millions of masks, rubbing alcohol and other vital things right here at home
And yet, somehow we've decided not to use those and buy some from abroad, at a vastly higher price
Funny how that happens isn't it
"That'll show them not to be unfriendly to us
" - Russia probably
I see, thanks for the detailed explanation
Our traditions in the sport span the ages, but you guys really raised the bar high for modern times
Depends, if you go back long enough two sets of names emerge, the slavic ones and the Bulgar ones
Don't know too much about female names through the ages, but I'd expect Teodora, Irina, Maria, Elena, Miroslava, Dara (more specific to the Bulgars) to be among the more popular ones
The male list:
Bulgar:
Asparuh, Kubrat, Boris, Bayan, Izbul, Tervel, Omurtag, Altshek, Irnik, Sevar etc
(Some are still used today as a homage)
Slavic: Dobromir, Simeon, Momchil, Presiyan, Kaloyan, Mihail, Ivan, Petar
(By far the more popular nowadays)
Стоянка (Stoyanka), that's so 17th century for me
Bulgar names like Kubrat, Asparukh and Tervel
I also know a guy named Balik after a 14th century lord
Giorgiu
Basically any name that ends with iu
Bonus female names through the ages: Kera, Keta, Kossara, Maria, Paraskeva
Diminutive names: Petko/Petka, Stefko/Stefka, Penko/Penka, etc, are super popular amongst older people
What are 5 interesting things about your country
(Erasmus game)
This was a game we used to play on one of my Erasmus exchanges
It is really quick and easy and you can get a quick idea of other countries if you had none before, so that you feel closer to them
So, I will start with Bulgaria:
Bulgaria is the oldest country in Europe, which has never changed its name since its foundation in 681
Bulgarians invented the Cyrillic alphabet in 893 during the 1st Bulgarian Empire
Bulgaria was the home of the Thracians, the Thracian hero Spartacus was born in present-day Bulgaria
Thus we consider ourselves a mixture of Bulgars, Thracians (they are the indigenous ones) and Slavic => Bulgarians
In Varna it was discovered the oldest golden treasure in the world, the Varna Necropolis, dating more than 6000 years back and we are 3rd in Europe with the most archaeological monuments/sites after Italy and Greece
We shake our heads for 'yes' and nod for 'no'.
Bonus: 'Tsar'/'Czar' is a Bulgarian title from the 10th century, derived from Caesar - Цезар (Tsezar) in Bulgarian
What are 5 interesting things about your countries
Interesting, I always wondered why San Marino exists lol
I also thought that Kinder is German, I mean makes sense since it is a German word
You had to name it Bambino :D
Mmm, Germans, French, Italians, Spanish, etc
I don't remember Croatians and Estonians in particular and also I was the only Bulgarian there
Yeah, but we didn't vanish from the earth during that time lol
It is still our history
We were also part of the Byzantine empire for around 150 years between the 1st and 2nd Bulgarian empires, that's why they are two empires
And still all this time from 681 until now the name was only Bulgaria and nothing else
No, a quick Google search would have answered your question
Cyril and Methodius, who were Byzatine monks invented the [Glagolitic alphabet] Their Bulgarian students invented the [Cyrillic alphabet] by a request of the Bulgarian Tsar [Simeon I the Great] because the Glagolitic looks like an alien script and no one understood it
The Cyrillic was created after the brothers already died and their Bulgarian students named the new alphabet in honor of their teacher Cyril
I feel like a saint in Reddit, educating people that these two are completely different alphabets
I don't know how many times I have answered this question
But they changed their name
It says that they were like a safe haven for monks from 301 because of persecution from the Roman Empire, but their constitution was written in 1600, thus making them an official sovereign country on that year
It is really uncertain what was their status from 301 to 1600
I imagine it something like Mount Athos in Greece which is also a safe haven for monks and it is administrated by themselves
Edit:
Evidence of the existence of a community on Mount Titano dates back to the [Middle Ages] That evidence comes from a monk named Eugippio, who reports in several documents going back to 511 that another monk lived here
In memory of the stonecutter, the land was renamed "Land of San Marino", and was changed to its present-day name, "Republic of San Marino".
The [Holy See] confirmed the independence of San Marino in 1631
Yup, they changed their name
The idea of what I wrote is that since the foundation of Bulgaria the name has always been Bulgaria and nothing else
This is not the case with San Marino since they changed their name from whatever was the original, probably [Monte Titano] which was more like a religious community rather than a real country until 1631
I did not say that Bulgaria is the oldest country in Europe but the oldest one which never changed its name and San Marino did that
Yeah, having the same identity and name, that's the whole point
Otherwise we would have changed the name if we lost our identity, wtf
If you want to convince me or the whole of Bulgaria that the 1st Bulgarian Empire from 681 has only the same name and nothing else in common with the present day, good look with that haha
It's funny how all of a sudden people having read practically nothing start judging other peoples' histories without knowing a damn thing about them
Try telling this to a Greek that Ancient Greece has nothing in common with modern Greece :)
The whole point of this post is to learn about other peoples' histories and fun facts, not to contradict historical facts with made up hypothesis of what a random person thinks vs facts
I haven't gone talking shit about the Netherlands, because I am not Dutch and I don't want to make a fool out of myself like you just did
Good night
Ah, ok it wasn't really clear what you were saying
Cyrillic is based predominantly on the Greek alphabet with some augmentations by the Glagolitic alphabet
To me personally it is entirely based on the Greek since it shares a lot of letters with it written exactly the same and only one letter from the Glagolitic Ш. The Glagolitic one, looks like the Georgian alphabet or an alien script
I don't understand anything from it and I can't see any other similar letters
Honestly, I don't even know why people are still talking about it since it was used only for 30 years in the 9th century before being replaced by the Cyrillic
Than what you said was even more stupid
Obviously they were not the same country
Before they were monarchies
Even 30 years ago when Bulgaria was a communist country, it is not the same country with the present day Bulgaria
That doesn't mean that they are 100 different Bulgarias
Are you 5
Same can be said for the Netherlands and every single country on earth who changes governments and their constitutions
'If the Netherlands became a republic tomorrow, it will not be the same country as before when it was a monarchy and all its history is lost, only the new republic Netherlands counts from tomorrow' This is what you sound like
Honestly idk what you are trying to say/prove and why you even started this stupid conversation
And why am I still answering you
I am not gonna answer anymore, cuz I am losing brain cells
Due to fake news currently a subset of the Bulgarian population believes that Bulgarian child protection services will steal their kids and send them to paedophile gay couples in Norway
What bullshit do your countrymen believe through fake news currently
I'm really getting tired of this shit about Norway here
On the bright side, it seems like people who believe this have become a laughing stock and are taken less seriously
Or at least they have more opposition than they did before, but maybe this is just my wishful thinking
But still a program for sexual education in a school in a bulgarian city got suspended a few days ago because one mother complained about it, even though her kid isn't enrolled in it and even though parents whose kids are actually in the program have nothing against it
Edit: That program was reinstated
Not about my country (since it's already mentioned) but there are legitimately far right people that believe Sweden is inundated with refugees and immigrants of Islamic persuasion who are so unruly that Sweden has turned into a "war zone" and that there are actual "no go zones" in various cities
It's easy to be fooled when you haven't been there (which is the case for all these Americans and Brits)
Funny thing is, they tried to do the same bullshit propaganda with the Netherlands
The USA ambassador to the Netherlands was saying there were no go zones in the Netherlands and that there were politicians being set on fire
That dude got absolutely annihilated by the Dutch press
It was gruesome to watch
Доживях да видя пост от българин тук, онзи ден срещнах българин в тотално рандъм съб. I feel connected
In Bulgaria homosexuality isn't accepted very good
Not extremely homophobic or something
Nobody has a problem as long as you are not messing with them
Part of the idea I think was to teach kids at very young age that they may be a boy or a girl and it pretty much doesn't matter biologically
As this is a very Christian country and family is very important a lot of people got angry af
I personally think that this stuff should be said at 16 and not 7
I don't think nobody has a problem with Norway but the news that were probably fake blew up
What
No way
Im from Bulgaria and Sex ED is normal, multiple parents complain because they're still homophobic communist pieces of shit but that doesn't change anything because Sex ED needs to be mandatory everywhere
Soros conspiracy is a classic over here
Ah yes, the age-old "Those dirty refugees are going to rape and abuse our women" despite the fact locals are fucking professionals at it, and no one bats an eyelash
That rhetoric goes beyond borders
Absolutely
Every scientist ever is a paid shill
Homosexuality was a mental disease in the 50s but they paid the scientists to get it out of the list of mental diseases
And don't get me started on the global warming - every climatologist ever is in the big green conspiracy backed by the green lobby
When you point out that the carbon lobby is way more rich and powerful, it doesn't really matter, they just change the subject
Ah yes,we had that too
I can speak only for Bulgarians
Obviously the weirdos who believe the conspiracy theories aren't fond of them very much, but there are no negative opinions in general
Bulgarians look up to all Western European countries
Specifically for Scandinavian countries, there is a sizable minority of people who are huge fans of their metal and mythology
Also some Bulgarians think that their norhern climate might be to much for our southern souls
And we kinda tend to group the 'Scandinavian countries' together
Will they also legalise euthanasia for the depressed
Because then I'm moving to Spain
Exactly
But more specifically they think that their kids will be taken away if they spank them (they really want to defend their "right" to hit their kids) or if their kid complains to someone that it's being abused and since according to them kids misunderstand and can't be trusted this will surely be the end of the "traditional Bulgarian family".
It all started when Bulgarian woman, living in Norway, got her kids taken away and turned into a massive conspiracy theory that the "eurogay" union/the liberal west is plotting to teach Bulgarian kids to be gay and steal them in order to give them to black gay couples
In a small city a while back people actually didn't let their kids to go to school out of fear
What pains me the most about this is that they paint child protective services as evil and side with every parent that got their kid taken away and that makes it harder to protect children who are actually being abused
Luckily, people seem to be coming to their senses or maybe the weirdos aren't as vocal anymore, which surprises me very much in a good way
There is hope, I guess
Btw, one conspiracy I believe in is that all of this outrage is fueled by Russian propaganda
0000001 because I'm moving to Spain then
Nah, we have it in Bulgaria, but I also have seen it in Italian forums, as well as half of the English-speaking ones - US, UK, Australia, etc
It's the go-to conspiracy
IDK what these people will do when he finally dies
Or if having a seizure
Starting from some level owning foreign language vice versa - some things thinking on foreign language and transate on own
I think on both languages equally easy but for translate from one on another need put effort because structure very different
Interesting, but for me it was surprisingly familiar and easy understand
Russians also so speak
Although in russian no rigid structure, can build sentence different ways and all they will be correct
Probably was very difficult transalte Yoda so he sounded wrong on russian
Yes, we won't even win one game in the qualifiers anyway
Ha, jokes on them, my country has no chance to qualify for the world cup anyways
The unthinkable has happened - our government actually took the correct measures in time
It did a halfway decent job
Wow
[EU citizens] Would you support a EU initiative for high speed rail network to reach Bulgaria and Greece
Okay, so, here's the thing: high speed rail is a staple in Western and increasingly - Central Europe, but there is still no high speed rail connection to Bulgaria and Greece
That makes them rather isolated than the wonderfully connected cities in the West and the North
Would you, as EU voters and tax payers, support a push for the construction of such, allowing the Easternmost territories of the continental EU to reach Budapest in 5 hours by land transport, rather than 13
A while ago, I've made this [fantasy map] but does it have to be fantasy, considering how much economical development and mobility it could bring for everyone
I am from Bulgaria and this rail network will be very efficient because we like to travel to Greece and other European contrys
I would use a train to Thessaloniki or Budapest
The distance (700km) is comparable to Paris - Nice or Paris - Barcelona
Yes
A train from Vienna to Istanbul via Beograd and Sofia and from Vienna to Athens via Beograd and Thessaloniki will be a good option
We were late to the party and we started with ADSLs and optics from the start :) Germany as an early adopter had an inherited infrastructure
I am waiting for this pandemic to finish to make my bucketlist and ride an ICE from Berlin to Frankfurt
Terminal 1 (if that's the one you mean) will be demolished soon
This is the new Terminal 3 they intend to build
The idea is to have the infrastructure built
A train from Germany to Greece will be economically inept
But a train from Greece to Hungary, Hungary to France or Romania to Czechia will allow thousands to travel faster
Off-course, if it turns out profitable to have combined auto-train + sleeper cars running from Germany to Greece, then the infrastructure will allow it
Not to mention that this will allow Thessaloniki to become the African entry port for shipping
That is already happening: Bulgaria is upgrading its main line from 65 to 160 kmh but it still has no high speed connection with its close countries like Romania and Hungary
Because these two are the furthest from being connected and they will be the last to be connected, if at all, unless the EU doesn’t make HSR a priority in the coming decades
In Netherlands you have HSR to neighbouring countries: Belgium, France, Germany, even England
Are they not effective, or are they only used to transport flowers and strawberries
No it shouldn't. Trains are far more efficient for passenger transport than buses, let alone a car
I was going to travel from Budapest to Prague with a night train before tha virus broke out
The night jets from Vienna are a big hit too, last time I checked
Exactly
It will improve local connections
ANy reasonable person would fly from Finland to Greece, but any reasonable person would take the train from Sofia to Bucharest if it was 2 hours rather than 7, as it is now
I would too
When I visited Berlin I was like a kid in a candy shop: I love trains and Berlin was like an overdose :D
The Rail Baltica is already under construction and it will link Helsinki (via ferry)
But it does: better and faster connections increase (economic) mobility
This increases GDP and EU budget contributions are based on GDP
The question is, would you as an EU citizen support an EU-wide initiative to stimulate the improvements of neighbouring member connections as the Benelux has - the option of fast, high speed/high capacity passenger+freight corridors
Far more eficient for X doesn't mean not efficiant for Y.
If you live in Hungary, you should've notices how used the rails are there
Sofia - Ruse is 6 hours
Ruse - Bucharest is an hour if there are no delays on the border
Top speed - 100kmh in a 15 km stretch in Moesia
The rest is on old lines, designed for speeds of 65 kmh and partially upgraded to 85-90kmh but that speed is only theoretical
Wuppertal's on my bucket list as well
If you think that is bad - the shortest travel time between Sofia and Silistra is 11 hours
Bulgaria
Might as well not try
Sometimes I wonder if my country actually exists or is just a fever dream
I do skip, and if there isn't a Bulgarian comment, I tend to post one
Don't worry, with the climate change you'll get harsher winters as well
It's a common misconception that the winters will now be nice and warm
Well, it could be the small-country-overwhelmed-by-huge-amount-of-tourists-from-bigger-different-place complex
Basically if your country is swarming with tourists with different culture (too direct Germans, too indirect Swiss) resentment is easy to develop, especially for people not having direct economic gains from said tourists (although probably all have some indirect ones)
It's happening in my country with some nationalities of tourists too, though I can't really tell you who's in vogue now and who not
(actually it's probably still the Britts that are the more unwanted tourists, us being marketed to them as a cheap place to booze up hasn't picked up the best of their clientelle)
I thought Maltesers are from Malta, but they are British
I was today years old when I found out that Disneyland Paris is not the OG
Me as well
Works well
As trash as the healthcare is in the Netherlands, it's still lightyears ahead of that third world country the US
It really depends on where you live
For example the tap water in Sofia is really good but the water in Plovdiv isn't and you have to drink bottled water, or you live in Pernik and have no water
Here it depends
Some people trust our tap water, some don't. When travelling, however, most people tend to avoid drinking tap water from the town they're visiting because the different minerals in the water will hurt their digestive system, apparently
It is very common to drink tap water
I use bottled water only for the coffee maker to avoid scale or when I go out and there is no drinking fountain nearby
Yup
Bulgaria has one of the finest tap water in Europe (because most cities have mountain springs close by
People still buy bottled water or fill up on mineral water at some springs because of the taste though
The tap water in Plovdiv is good in my opinion
That's what I've been drinking for the past 4-5 years
It also depends on where in Sofia one lives
My neighborhood, I've heard, gets its tap water from Iskur Dam, which can't match Vitosha spring water or water from the various mineral springs in and around the city
Then again, I haven't tasted my home's tap water for quite some time - I have been using a filtering pitcher for a few years now
Back in the first half of the 2010s I remember it wasn't too good but was still completely drinkable
Last year they had a drought and new pipes were layed from some other water source
It's now mostly a joke
Very often actually
There are some cases, where there is no coresponding word in my language of the english one
You have no idea how many times I have called Brasil 'Brasil' and not the Bulgarian Бразилия(Braziliya)
I sometimes even catch myself when I had done it and I am always like "shit I just said the name of the country in English" to the person I am speaking
Talk about Northern Macedonia
Just don't do it man
We talk shit constantly about our government BUT that does not mean you can join in, you can't.
Banitsa gang rise up
Not meme-wise that I've heard of but middle aged men act the same way they're just not memed about because it's seen as a stereotypical "woman" thing
But it isn't only women who do it
When men do it is just a guy getting angry and entitled for no reason but it isn't turned into a whole *thing*.
111 place in the world on index for free press
Lowest in the EU, at this point I'm no longer sad, just laughing
i was just about to say it, thanks for making it easier for me
Well the police beat up a  teen while hiding behind a wall so it isnt public but it was recorded anywas so this sparked a lot of negativity  ... and the prime minister is still full of shit with no dignity to resign
Besides thats its all good ( to all bulgarians seeing this please dont scold me if i told anything wrong lol im not in track with what happened to the kid)
The media is shutting down the information
They are saying that the protesters are bought by some mafia man, living his life in Dubai, when the truth is that many young people(18-30) are protesting for their future, my future, as well
We don't want to live in some random country far away from home
Media is also lying about the numbers of protesters
If you are not living in the capital city (where is the biggest protest against the PM, his cabinet and the General Prosecutor), it would hardly make impact on your day
The PM ran away for very "important" meetings in West Europe, instead of staying and going to the people,that  chose him and facing them and giving them explanation for his actions
Also nice nickname
You sound more Dutch then
What's the deal with childcare in Ireland
I have a colleague that landed a very comfy and well-paid job there, moved with family ...and a year or some later came back running
Turns out his wife was pregnant with twins and after some quick calculations prices for care were ridiculous according to him
Speeding on the highway is not an issue so it is resources spent on something that has no correlation with accidents
Not before, but we usually drink AFTER exams, mostly the major ones - 4th grade, 7th grade and 12th grade
Yep I remember those times in elementary school older kids would call the police and say that there is a bomb in the school so they don't do the test that day
Which is kinda stupid because that way they would know who had test on that day and find who was the caller
After that the whole school would be evacuated, the police comes with trained dogs and search for it but never found anything
They do ther best, bless their souls
Tom Hanks did a decent job in [Terminal]
Well, his wife is Half-Bulgarian, so he had his Father-in-Law to teach him :)
It's the Law, if I am not mistaken
The country is made up
The language isn’t xexxe
Not very bad (someone has asked me this before)
His Italian accent is VERY thick but his grammar is almost perfect
Yes
Not as much as a tradition but more as something you do in general here
Yes, at least in my region
It's just a simple "Добър ден" (have a nice day) or "здравейте" (hello)
Yes
Behind this tradition in our country stands our long history of being culturally connected with the nature
We believe that when we are in the mountain, we are equal, we are not part of the civilisation, in which (in the past) saying hello to the higher-standing people in terms of social postion was obligatory
In the mountains there were no social boundaries - rich said hello to the peasents and so did the peasants
Because we're equal in front of the face of mother nature
Today it's polite to say hello and it's almost a rule to do so
And the feeling is great, tbh
Not like in the city where we pass total strangers, remaining cold and not saying a word
tradition
"Tradition" на английски не значи само буквално "официална традиция" ;)
Имах в предвид че не е задължително като "Отидеш ли в планината не кажеш ли добър ден на хората 100 години лош късмет", имах предвид че е прието да поздравяваш хората и не в планините а принципно .
Да, не сме като Скандинавците :)
This is true for most of the USA but in Saint Louis (home of Budweiser) you can drink in the street no problem
You can even drink in the car here as long as you are not the driver
If you get pulled over by the cops and there are 4 people in the car and only 3 open drinks
it's no problem
Mardi Gras and St
Patrick's day here are basically massive outside college parties taking up whole neighborhoods with a parade
That company has made this city paradise for the alcohol enthusiast
Just wanted to share
I went to a sauna in Helsinki and it was so fun
I had been to saunas before but this was on a when different level
The secret to getting Finns to talk to you is to meet them in a sauna
Same thing happened here back then and it was the same guy dubbing seemingly every movie
Now we have the same five guys dubbing every movie/show instead
Весела Коледа!
"Bulgarian constant = basically anything which makes your result correct
Sep 17, 2012"
Well
that's interesting
Rofl, I guess we've expirted some construction workers your way too
That's hilarious because it's exactly how you get approved for government contracts in Bulgaria
I wonder about the origin of that because we have never had elections even with a regular majority - ever since communism fell
Maybe it refers to communist times
But then, literally every eastern bloc country had "Bulgarian majority" in elections
The same threat is very common here
Though on one particular occasion I remember being told I'd end up "feeding ducks in the village", as in "so fucking stupid all you can do is feed livestock in a rural area" ...though, ironically, "ducks" can be used as slang for *dicks*.
I don't know of any specific job that gets called out like this here but there's a common saying that you should study hard so you won't have to work hard, which is wrong on so many levels
I mean, I know it stems from the older generations not seeing mental labor as "work" but still
I am sure most of them are joking
No i meant that i am pretty sure that a lot of the Europeans that say that people from texas ride horse to school are most likely not from a city or really *not smart*. I wonder why would educated americans think this way about France and probably other parts of Europe though
We have this dish called "zapekanka", which roughly translated to "baked", but "zapek" also means constipation, so one day Facebook exploded with pictures of a [dinner menu] offering tourists "Constipation with yellow cheese". Also, the word for "tongue" and "language" in Bulgarian is "ezik", so the same menu offered "Language in butter".
The most terrible professional translation, I've ever seen was literal translation of the phrase "for crying out loud" in a Kurt Vonnegut’s novel "The sirens of Titan". A literal translation of this phrase makes absolutely no sense, so when I figured out what the original was, I wanted to find the translator and rip their diploma apart
A classic one from many years ago is the pawn shop that was translated to English as *”hostage house”*
A funny one for me is names
In general names get literal translations but every now and then translators decide to be clever or some shit and we get some gems
For example the Wolverine(the hero not the animal) is called the Wearwolf, which makes no sense
Another one comes from the Lord of the Rings Books
In them the translator was like “Hey, what if I translate the Bag in Baggins
”, leading to me getting acquainted with the Torbinses
But the funniest one I found a few weeks ago
I was with my grandma and was looking through her bookshelves
There I found a 1980’s translation of “The left hand of darkness” by Ursula Le Guin
And her name was translated as, I shit you not, Urshula lyoguin(read as you see)(Уршула Льогуин)
Like, I get where he was coming from with her last name
It sounds French, so it makes sense to me in some way, but where the fuck did that sh come from
And note, in bookstores I’ve seen translations that translate her name normally, so what the fuck was Boris Mindov smoking
Как изобщо?
за плачене навън шумно?
Какво как - в масло

I love baked kashkaval in any form
Не за “For crying out loud”. Как изобщо може някой да реши че това е в едно и също полукълбо с верния превод?

Usually at the end of June 30 degrees are the norm here
This is the first day since the April snowfalls to have such temperatures
We had a very cold and rainy spring
Nah bro it's not hot at all it been fucking raining
One the last two days we have had actual nice weather
Sofia (the city I live in) is 550 meters above sea level and it's the third highest European capital after Madrid and Andorra la Vella
In early March and late November we can get -5 in the morning and 15 in the afternoon
Sofia is at the base of Vitosha mountain so we technically have snow until early July (because Cherni vrah Peak is within the municipality and it's 2290 meters high)
It is a rare event to have snow in April and many people are worried for their harvests, when it happens, because the trees and the early cultures have already blossomed
But it happened this year
We'll be fine
Dobrudzha has seen worse and Trakiya is always warm, so even if the early harvest fails, Trakiya will pick up the slack
But from what I've seen from my friends to the North, the fields are almost ready for the first harvest of grain
After all, we have to keep up the export quotas to the rest of the EU, Lybia and Egypt
A country of ruins
Both literally and figuratively
Almost all Bulgarians identify themselves as Bulgarians first and foremost, then regionally
The Šops and Macedonians tend to identify more regionally than most other Bulgarians
A mix of healthcare and paid leave for vacation
But unfortunately, some of your countrymen seem to think these things are "communist".

The first article of a state's Constitution usually reflects or rejects the spirit of the last one
So, naturally, the Constitution of the Republic of Bulgaria starts with the dissolution of the People's Republic of Bulgaria:
>**Art
***(1) Bulgaria shall be a republic with a parliamentary form of government
*(2) The entire power of the State shall derive from the people
The people shall exercise this power directly and through the bodies established by this Constitution
*(3) No part of the people, no political party nor any other organization, state institution or individual shall usurp the expression of the popular sovereignty
And the preamble is:
>*We, the Members of the Seventh Grand National Assembly, guided by our desire to express the will of the people of Bulgaria, by pledging our loyalty to the universal human values of liberty, peace, humanism, equality, justice and tolerance; by holding as the highest principle the rights, dignity and security of the individual; in awareness of our irrevocable duty to guard the national and state integrity of Bulgaria, hereby proclaim our resolve to create a democratic and social state, governed by the rule of law, by establishing this*
> ####Article 1
>(1) Bulgaria shall be a republic with a parliamentary form of government
>(2) The entire power of the State shall derive from the people
The people shall exercise this power directly and through the bodies established by this Constitution
>(3) No part of the people, no political party nor any other organization, state institution or individual shall usurp the expression of the popular sovereignty
The rest can be found in English [here]
So, this is a funny one
We were in London and decided to go to a musical/play in one of the theaters
Everything was awesome, the music was great and so on
During the 15 minute break in the middle of the show a girl comes out, carrying a "briefcase" or more like a box that looked like a box for medical emergencies, with a defibrillator or something like that
We're looking at her with my SO, and we're thinking - oh, it looks like someone got sick or needs a doctor, that's pitty, we hope they'll be fine
And then
The girl opened the box and inside
there was ice-cream
in the theatre
In the beautiful building with beautiful interior and seats
And she started selling ice cream
And people were eating it inside
It was funny, because if in our country someone tried to get ice cream inside he'll be thrown out in no time
And there they were selling it themselves
Northwestern Bulgaria (Vidin, Montana, Vratsa, Pleven) and the Kardzhali region
The guys in Northwestern Bulgaria are very poor, poor transport and infrastructure   the same is with the region of Kardzhali
The government does not care with these regions and Kardzhali are siding with Turkey, while in the Northwest some even want to be part of Romania
Saddness is most places here
The northern parts of the country used to be very culturally significant and important for food production but they're steadily declining, more and more schools and entire villages are shutting down, libraries and cultural centres in towns and cities, etc
I watched a brief report about how one town where the entire fire department was *2 people*.
In the West, the city of Pernik spent *months* without water this past year
I think they have some available now
Just
*the whole city*, without any water
In addition to that, the mob presence is stronger in everyday life than other cities, from what friends have told me
Ever heard of Vratsa Region
Lol
I guess that one time in 1277, when Ivaylo, a peasant from Northern Bulgaria, led an uprising that resulted in the demise of emperor Konstantin Tih Asen
After the defeat, Ivaylo took the throne and ruled for a year until 1279
Summer time
I don't care about when it get darks in the winter - it can already get dark at 16, so it doesn't bother me if it's earlier
I do care about having more sunlight during the summer in the evening, however, especially at the sea
Unpopular opinion: keep it
Both of the other 2 options are worse
If we kept summer time, in the winter it would be dark until 9:00-10:00 which will make getting out of bed ever more difficult for most people, it is just not natural to get up 3 hours BEFORE sunrise
If we kept winter time, in the summer the sun would rise at 4:00-5:00, which will mess with a lot of people's sleep
And also, it would mean 1 less hour of enjoying the sunlight after work, so that sucks
Honestly, daylight saving time was a good idea and does more good than harm
Ideally, I would like it to be a gradual transition over a month (say, 15mins per week) instead of the sudden 1 hour jerk, so people wouldn't feel it, but it's still better than the alternatives
This was supposed to be done last year already
I, and everyone I've asked about this here prefer summer time
Though apparently there were polls on it and 60% preferred summer time, so not that much of an overwhelming majority
Even though we were allies with Hitler and part of the Axis Powers, we didn't send a single Jew to the concentration camps, although Hitler put pressure on us to do so
Even to this date a lot of Israelis come each year specifically to Bulgaria to visit because they still remember what we did for them
Edit: We were the only country in Europe alongside with Denmark, who did not obey Hitler's orders and did not send its Jewish population
We did a bloodless revolution too
Didn't work that well
>Never in our history have we had an expansion war
Even if you only count from the unification of Romania, there's the second Balkan War and both World Wars
European cities are not so driver-friendly as their US counterparts, so they'll have to do some serious remodelling whatever they choose
Sunny Beach in Bulgaria
There's literally a district in Plovdiv named "The Trap". As the name suggests, it's very popular with tourists
In Sofia I would say Vitosha bul
I just don't get it
If you want to eat from McDonald's why bother coming to another  country to do so
Also restaurants there are very bleak and don't represent the original BG cuisine at all and food in general isn't very good for the price you pay to sit there
If you want to go to a good restaurant then you can totally walk through the little streets that lead to Vitosha bul
- there you can find extravagant and or little but cosy restaurants and pay half the price
Also you have to check up Graf Ignatiev str
for cute little shops and coffee shops
The street is more pleasant to go, have a walk and enjoy the beautiful day than going to a mall or H&M.
Yeah, same one
It's pretty nice honestly
I remember I hated it when I visited 10 years ago, totally different picture now
They've paid a lot of attention on tourism and making it overall pretty neat and tidy
People are pretty chill, it's kind of our stereotype for them
Good lads, how else would you see the beauty of the Bulgarian male physique
Joking aside, ultras/nazis/meatheads/wannabe gangsters are a thing in the major cities unfortunately
Glad you like the city tho :)
I eat yoghurt with everything
I wear adidas tracksuits
I am very racis- I mean, what
My grandfather taught me to write like that, he called it Blockschrift
He was half-German, maybe that explains it
Balkans, but it's more like a wishful and nostalgic sigh with a tear in our eye
North Macedonia
Also Northern Dobruja from Romania
And Southern Macedonia from Greece
And Eastern Thrace from Turkey
And the Western Morava valley from Serbia
Ahh, irredentism
We joke abput BULGARIA ON THREE SEAS
some ppl actually take it seriusly
For some of our parties it's not a joke
They're quite openly calling for taking Macedonia, Albania and Northern Greece
The good news is their power in parliament has diminished
Like: Cyprus is Greek, Macedonia is Bulgarian, Kosovo is Serbia, Constantinopol not istanbul
Change my mind
> We are a split country
Half the population actually want PiS in charge
Basically you're in the same situation as the US right now
I don’t understand the whole race classification thing
What’s the difference between hispanic white and non hispanic white
How’s a white person of Spanish descent different to a white person of French descent, for example
I’ve been asked what race I was once, by an American
I just replied I was Bulgarian, then she asked me if I was Latino
So many things haha
Tipping culture outside of food & beverage especially
Like tipping a nail artist or hair dresser
I've read about Americans getting a terrible haircut or bad service and still tipping "because you're supposed to"... like
no wtf
I've seen what nail artists over there charge $60 for and it's a rip off
I cannot fucking believe you also *tip* for that
I've noticed a lot of Americans aproach things a certain way
It's kind of hard to explain without making a huge overly simplified generalization but for example, imagine we're talking about food, right, and it's like burgers or steaks or something
And I mention something about bbq grills not being a common item here, for example
This gets followed by like
disbelief
Like WHAT ?? You DON'T HAVE this ESSENTIAL ITEM
Like the very idea of the American Lifestyle Experience^(TM) not being available in this other place (which *isn't* a third world country, so it must be *liveable*) is just so weird
What is there then
What do you use
*How do you live
I'm sure this also applies to people state-to-state
I know Floridians are shocked when there's no AC in northern states, for example
It's just something I noticed in Americans and found funny
Like you guys tend to be super used to your own personalised notions of normality and you aproach new things starting from the American perspective, not from a "blank slate" perspective
I think this is where the stereotype of how "Americans are ignorant" comes from
Which is unfair because *everybody* is ignorant about something
You guys aren't that special
The stupidity is quite alarming
What do you guys do at school
Fast food in Europe is vastly different due to a hell of a lot stricter food safety laws, which also makes it a bit less unhealthy
This post is a month old, how the fuck did you even find it haha
They are rarely the same thing, if ever
American bbqs tend to be very large and outdoor only
Pretty much every bbq here is more of a *grill* than a bbq
[American bbqs] vs [most bbqs I've seen in Europe]
The whole point of my example ties into the way Americans approach foreign subjects though
For example, (assuming you're Dutch) and we're talking about breakfast, I could say "peanut butter isn't that popular here" and you go on a tangent about how "What do you put hagelslag on
Just regular butter
" without even taking a second to consider that hagelslag is not very popular *at all* outside of the Netherlands
In Bulgaria you have 2 days off for a funeral of a blood related family member, or spouse
2 days for your marriage, and we have 45 days sick leave to take care of children per year
I don't know if this counts but men do get 15 days paternity leave, from the day the mother of your child is discharged from the hospital
[Shiroka laka] or [Koprivshtitsa]
Every travel vlog about Bulgaria focuses on Sofia, the Rila Monastery and Plovdiv and sometimes - Veliko Tarnovo
~~Sunny beach
It's not really a city, more of a seasonal summer resort but the place is extremely trashy with drugs, alcohol, sex and scams going rampant
Not really anything to do other than drinking either
So unless you come to Bulgaria for sex or alcohol tourism, let's pretend it doesn't exist, okay~~
EDIT: Read the question wrong, don't visit Sunny Beach
Go to Rhodope instead, it's the big mountain next to Greece
Any city or village there sees very few tourists but the hiking trails in the West Rhodope are amazing
Many caves too
Or if you like ancient history, go to East Rhodope - there are dozens of ancient temples, fortresses, very well preserved Roman villa
A lot of it isn't well researched but there is a certain charm in looking at an ancient temple or fortress before it saw excavations and is officially open to tourists
Not a Bulgarian city
I thought Montenegro as a whole was quite cool
Hissarya
The town's mineral waters literally heal diseases and the ancient part of the city is still surrounded with massive ancient fortifications
The Romans knew what they were doing when they built it in the first place
Well in Bulgarian Ne meens no in Greek Ne meens yes
Pronoused the same
And we use chao pronoused as the Italian hello - ciao , in Bulgarian mean Bye
On a tram in Vienna
To be fair Bulgarian is not spoken by many, so they probably felt safe in talking loud
Anyway, at one stop a crying boy and an elderly woman (his grandmother, probably) come on
It seems to boy got in a fight in school so the grandma advised him in a rather loud voice: "Next time just kick them in the balls and run away". I had a "coughing fit" at hearing this
The Spansh cards look like the large Arcanas of the Tarot cards
Bellow 15C is starting to get cold in my opinion,  below 10C is cold and below 5C is freezing
I like cold, so for me to feel cold it would probably need to be around 0-10 degrees
hahaha *cries in aphantasia*
In Turkish it means that the person with the big balls (sometimes just the balls like a man with balls) has a lot of connections and money i. e. powerfull
Having balls means being brave here too although there is a good thing called "боли ме хуя/boli me huya" directly translates "my dick hurts" means "I don't care"
Go in Bulgaria everything is almost free for people from Western Europe
Sunny Beach is a generic resort made specifically to scam foreigners out of money so don't worry about not liking it haha
The taxi drivers are notorious scammers, it's insane
Tried charging me 50 leva for a distance that's normally worth about 15 at most
At ballotage, yes
Otherwise the people I vote for are "I trust your intentions but not your ability to pull it off".
I’m pretty sure we have one of the highest percentage rates of smokers in the EU it’s extremely common but a lot of people are switching out cigarettes for other things such as IQOS
Well we are second in Europe and sixth in the world in percentage of the population that smokes (tobacco that is)
35% and rising in the last 6 years
Uncool
How TF
Here's the thing
When I smoked and lived in the UK, I could somehow always figure out a way to afford cigarettes and coffee
It's a skill
Granted usually at the detriment of say food, but hey appetite suppressant
Paris or the actually country of France
"Deep south" I've never heard Limburg described like that before
"Why are you guys still using the Russian alphabet
[Most probable reaction from a Bulgarian]
Calling the Cyrillic alphabet anything other than Bulgarian, especially Russian
Tell someone the Cyrillic alphabet is Russian/made in Russia they will try to murder you with words
Some ignorant Westerners think that Eastern Europe is just Russia and it's still socialist, which triggers the Bulgarian and the other ethnicities
Also we don't love the topic about Macedonia (North Macedonia)
Bulgarians (and surely many others) call any cheese with holes in it "Swiss cheese".
We call the UK "Angliya" ("England")
Once a Bulgarian, speaking English, presented a Scotswoman as a lady "from England". She got mad and shouted "Scotland
" at the top of her lungs
Phoebe must be cringing hard right now
Ok, West Russian
I beg to differ [
One of my Macedonian Bulgarian ancestors emigrated to Northeastern Bulgaria, so in a sense it fits
We have the second worst demographic crisis in the world, behind Lithuania
There were 2 guys named Evlogi and Hristo Georgievi
They had around 23 million Bulgarian levas (or 11
5 million euros) and the population of the Principality of Bulgaria (1878-1908) had 6 million (3 million euros) - combined
They were rich as fuck
Where
Done
Danke schön.
It's definitely not *that* common
It's way more common on the seaside than by a pool
I don't think I've seen a topless lady at a pool, in fact, I'm pretty sure it's generally not allowed
I'd say it's rare, about
one in 30 women
A small percentage but I don't think it's anything particularly shocking for anyone, just rare
Entirely nude is *very rare* for either sex, though there's usually small more-or-less designated areas for that
However, it's very common for kids up until puberty to be topless, until about 11 probably
Other visitors to Bulgarian beaches are more than welcome to share their findings, I haven't been to the beach in too long :(
In my country it's less than 5%. Probably because of our culture being much more hostile to nudity in public than other Europeans'. Whenever I go to a public beach, there are always 2 or 3 topless women in sight, but no more
Yeah, I have also noticed that
Not only Germans in particular, but rather people from Central/Western/Northern Europe
They are extremely blunt
They can say anything to you no matter how inappropriate it is, without taking into consideration your feelings and how this will make you feel
I hate that so much
I always try to make people feel not like shit, so even when I get asked about my opinion or if I see something wrong, most times I will lie and say it's ok or just won't say anything (not with close friends of course)
And don't come at me with obvious dumb shit like you see someone who has toilet paper sticking out of his pants and you won't say anything, no of course, if you have some social skills you know when to be honest and when to keep what you have to say to yourself
I just don't like making other people uncomfortable, because I hate being in such situations myself when other people make me feel like the way you were treated
Sure, they can Google you no one will find out, that way they can be at an ease that you are not some psychopath and it should stay only with them this info, but bringing it up, that is what I am talking about bluntness and pure stupidity
Makes sense, if you ask me
I understand Middle English best, Early Modern is
tricky
I kind of get it but it feels trickier than Middle English
Old English is a lost cause though
I understand Scots perfectly,  I think that's why Middle English is easier for me
This is the part I admit Shakespeare just isn't my strong point lmao
What I got was: "If you lie, you will be hung on the next tree until you are starving, if you speak truth (googled it to make sure
)" aaaaand that's all I got
And then some "Ring the alarm" towards the end
Genuinely zero understanding of anything in between
Like
I think I understand the word
But I understand them all seperately
I can just feel my old English teacher glaring at me for this now haha
We have vonfire day - Pokladi here its on the 49th day before Easter,  we say sorry to all of our family members,  then big , tall bonfires were let on fire we stay  and dance around them,  when they start to die of the tradition say that the young mans of the community should jump above the dying coles
[He was a Bulgarian MP in the European Parliament
] Don't know how he even got there, but everybody made fun of his English and overall incompetence
While Axis Bulgaria saved its 50000 Jews from concentration camps, mostly after civil uproar and unrest, the pro-fascist government happily shipped 10000 Jews from occupied Macedonia to Auschwitz shortly before that
It is not true that Bulgaria did not have control, and the cabinet was enthusiastic in its service to the Reich
It is just that the wider public knew nothing about it
This was brought to light by few individuals and wide civil unrest prevented the extradition of Jews from country proper
Don't actually know what Bulgaria did to be fair
In sure we've got some non - medieval stuff
The Inquisition in fact resulted in few convictions, as opposed to the witch trials in Protestant Europe
Nevertheless witch trials had like 100000 convicted over a couple of centuries for whole Europe, mostly in war zones, so while terrible, they are far from the biggest atrocities
Pogroms on minorities were worse alone
Helping Germany in both world wars
Like most of its neighbours, Bulgaria has a lot of ancient traditions still kept but one of the most fascinating ones to me is our kuker festivals
At the beginning of spring every year we have festivals around the country where men would dress with thick costumes made of animal hydes and fur and wear a ton of giant bells around their waists
Once the festival begins they start jumping around, making noise with their bells and scaring the evils and demons of the winter away
Sometimes they even do little ritual re-enactments of the everyday lives of our ancestors as a blessing for good health, good harvest and happy family
For us Bulgarians that would be the Martenitsa, for health every March first until Spring
Радвам се да гледам и чета сърбин и хърватин да си говорят и да се разбират!!! Браво братя!
A Bulgarian that dosent eat yogurt
A Bulgarian that can't fix anything
I thought about rakija but that also applies to the rest of our Balkan siblings
In Bulgarian the sun is neuter, while the earth, the moon and the stars are feminine
Sun is neuter, Moon is feminine
A male form for the moon exists which is also the word for “month”.
The Moon is always depicted as a woman
Some folklore has it as Queen of the female spirits
The Sun is always depicted as male, even though it’s neuter
In bulgarian it's Слънцето (read like this: Slŭntseto) (male) and Луната (read like this: Lunata) (female)
Bulgarian:
Sun - Слънце - Slance/Slunce (neutral)
Moon - Луна - Luna (feminine)
Earth - Земя - Zemya/Zemq (feminine)
Yeah, you're right
I am just used to saying it like it's male but it really is neutral
For Bulgaria it would be the Bulgarian empire under Simeon in about 900 AC
Huge territories, from today's Greece to Budapest
And as a whole - rich, powerful country and also cultural boom
Latin, though it isn't used many languages have their roots set in Latin
Meaning you can understand those languages to a certain degree
Edit: oh wait you said job market
EU: German; SA: Spanish; Africa: French; Asia: Mandarin
How exactly is Russian a rare language
It's one of the most spoken languages in Europe
It's really hard
In Bulgarian we usually shorten up words when we talk to others which is not taught in schools
We also have a lot of dialect words
However, I've seen foreigners speak fluently, so it's not impossible
Sounding like a native Bulgarian speaker, when considering only the sounds of the language and the pronunciation, is perfectly doable and I have seen many foreigners do it
The grammar, on the other hand, is quite strange even for speakers of other Slavic languages and foreigners almost always make the same mistakes that to a native speaker seem so silly and will reveal the fact that you are a non-native within seconds
We don't really mind these though - we know that our language is complicated and whenever someone takes the time to sit and learn even the slightest bit of it we try our best to be encouraging
It's really easy to say "next to impossible" but it's actually *not*. It takes *effort*. A lot of it
But it is entirely possible
I've met foreigners with the *slightest* accents and excellent grammar, to the point I didn't even know they aren't native speakers, I just thought they were from different parts of the country
I'd say you need a minimum of a year or two of very active studying and immersion
And a very deciding factor of your pronounciation will be your native language and your ability to distance yourself from your native pronounciation - I find that this is where accents come from
Your mouth is just used to pronouncing things a certain way
Both grammar and pronounciation are equally difficult for foreigners but again, it would depend on native language
Slavic speakers have a better chance
Impossible, both grammar and pronunciation
I can immediately spot a non-native speaker even from other Slavic languages, let alone from other language families speakers
Three good examples are a Russian sexologist who has been living in Bulgaria since I can remember myself
My god she speaks Bulgarian awful both grammatical and oral
Unlike the rest of the Slavic languages, Bulgarian has articles and she never uses "the", so it sounds like your typical Russian in American movies with bad grammar and bad pronunciation
Another example is a Croatian guy who came from Bosnia like 25 years ago, he was a child around 13 I think and he still to this date does not speak perfect Bulgarian, I can clearly hear his accent and he is from a very close language to Bulgarian, gives you an idea that anyone else will be impossible for them to speak like a native
Third example is from an Italian guy I think he has been living here for 30 years, it feels like he has been living here for only a year
His Bulgarian is practically shit
The only guys I have heard who speak basically like natives are Macedonians, they basically have to change their accents
I saw on the news 3 Macedonian guys were living for 10 years in Bulgaria and they sound 100% like natives, I was impressed
I'd say it is pretty hard to learn both for Bulgarian
I have met my share of foreigners who have settled in Bulgaria, but pronunciation-wise I have never heard someone adapt fully
I am not saying it is impossible, but I'd assume it is really hard
Grammar I think is more manageable, but it is not a whole lot easier, either
Overall, I'd say it is hard not to spot a foreigner, even if he has lived for a long time in Bulgaria
Lol, that's hilarious
why am i reading this with a french accent in my mind
Thank you to Russia for helping liberate us from the ottomans
Thank you to Greece, Serbia and Montenegro for helping us kick the ottomans out of the Balkans
Thank you to all the western Europeans that founded the EU keeping peace on the continent and which will eventually turn all of Europe into a great place to live
And of course thank you to Romania for being our bros
I would like to thank Russia for helping Bulgaria getting it's independence back from the ottoman empire
The fires have been covered because the fire season in Bulgaria is also raging with 4 fires currently
The Party Conventions were covered and now the US is mostly reported on in terms of the pandemic or whatever the Trump gem of the day is
Some days we have no news from the US
>Hourly
Daily
Weekly
Is it annoying
Too much
Are you okay with it
We don't have 24/7 news channels like you guys
Our typical "main news broadcast" is 30 minutes, 15 of which are events from Bulgaria and 15 - international news, so daily, the US gets
max 5-10 minutes across all news broadcasts, but most of that are repeats of the same news, which is fine
It's important to know what's happening over there but naturally - we are more interested in what's happening in Europe
Newspapers and their news sites have more coverage on the US because they are constantly producing content
Only if something happened like a school shooting, or something stupid Trump said, or some new invention is made there
We dont have a lot of USA centered news
Recetly USA is more common because of the elections you guys have
Actual combing
He doesn't do euphemisms or metaphors really, but his base always claims he is "just joking" even though the only time I saw a genuine laugh out of that man was when someone called Hillary a dog or whatever it was, lol
One of the best subbredits
We should keep up the great work, Europe
nice, a pyrocynical fan
I don't really support this united superpower idea it is going to destroy the identity of so many people
And it probably won't last that long
[Sunny beach
] I don't understand the desire to go on such a crowded place and call it "a holiday" just for some dirt cheep debauchery
German pentioners are already very present to the North
Yeah
First (and last) time I was there, I went on a date with this Irishman
I couldn't keep up
Nesebar is my favourite city but the noise of Sunny beach is ruining the whole area
I’d say “Google it” but that will be a very sad search
You don't have to apologise
Maybe I am just getting old and slowly morf into the "back in my days" kinda guy, but Sunny beach was a beautiful resort
Now it's overdeveloped, underregulated and pathetic in terms of social infrastructure
Like I said: dirt cheap debauchery
I get drunk after 1,5 pints of lager
That sucks
But we have the benefit to have learned to have fun without alcohol :)
Well, that's maybe North Macedonia, but also our neighbours can be rivals too, but Greece are rivals with Turkey; Romania are with Hungary; Serbia are with Croatia and Bosnia
Soo ,yeah North Macedonia
I don’t think Bulgaria has one
But maybe North Macedonia
After thinking about this I don't think Bulgaria has one at the moment
A rival has to be at least semi-equal to you
Most Europeans are ahead and a few are behind so there is no rival
at the moment
Water
That's your rival
Very true
But they are like our little brothers bro
I think most Bulgarians see Macedonia as our little brother rather than a rival
I think most Bulgarians see Macedonia as our little brother rather than a rival
We don't think of you guys as rivals at all
More like our little cousin who is in his rebelious teenager phase
Annoying, but cute
Yes, but they are still our rivals (at some point)
I also think Serbia is a great rival and Greece too
Exactly
Kind of like a younger brother that we love even though they hate us
No dude I don't think you guys are
At all
I see you guys as like a cousin or a little brother more than anything else tbh
Love you guys
Haha, we're always cursing those damn Romanians and their damn decent (looking) economy
Seriously though, even the smaller cities I've been to in Romania are stunning compared to Bulgarian infrastructure
They aren't our rivals
Not historically and certainly not now
We don't really have rivals
I know I shouldn't have laughed at this but I did
Look at us
bonding over Macedonians
Who would have thought
Trus in Bulgarian means quake/shake, divan - sofa and kvachka - duck/annoying person
> бабка - dragonfly (ukr)
Lol, it means old woman/grandma in Bulgarian too, that's pretty funny
It's usually used in a rude way too
Dinya in Bulgarian is watermelon
I like my life in Bulgaria, though sometimes I wish the people weren't so narrow-minded
I can have a decent quality of life and our politics are too entertaining to miss out
As a Bulgarian I imagine living here after l get a high-paying job wouldn't be much worse than living in a more developed country
But then l realise l'm one of the lucky ones who have yet not been humiliated by
the way everything works here
Yes, as long as we're healthy and financially stable it'll be all good
Until our health declines and we need quality medical care that we can't find here
Until an oligarch tries to pressure us to do something and we need protection from the law but he owns the law
Until one of the countless drunk driver scum crashes into us after our corrupt police let him drive
Corruption and our тарикатлък is a sickness that plagues every single bit of our beautiful country and you never know when it will ruin your life
Oh gosh
Two years ago the same kind of non-sense gained a lot of traction here (people completely misunderstanding the concept of gender as a social construct)
But I feel like while we're not progressive on these issues by any means, at least people who violently oppose the 'third gender' are not taken seriously
And we basically don't talk about this anymore
I wonder what went differently in Romania
But damn, banning an entire academic field
what happened to free speech
It's ironic given how often alt-right people complain about violations of their free speech
And I always tend to think about Romania and Bulgaria as the same thing lol How are things going with LGBT rights in Romania
Do you feel like society is getting more accepting
I personally feel optimistic about Bulgaria
All are valid concerns, there is for certain a lot of work left to be done to catch up with the west
The law is all there - it's just not enforced
Not to the people in power, not to the common person who drives home every night after a few rakias
I believe that this is a workable state of affairs - certainly a lot of work is needed - but with a couple of elections going in the right direction we can fix that
Let's stay positive
In our constitution it says "between a man and a woman" :(
Literally the only issue Bulgarians are progressive about is abortion - I think around 90% of Bulgarians support it, it's so excepted there isn't even a debate
I would really love to see same-sex mariagge legalised and for people to become more open-minded (when it comes to all kinds of issues), but it's a very long road ahead
Well, there's some hope at least
One of our biggest problems in my opinion is our huuuuge inferiority comlplex
And we end up compensating by excessively praising mediocre achievements of Bulgarians(often times emmigrants who probably don't identify with being Bulgarian much) instead of focusing on what we can do here and now and believing in ourselves
Sounds super corny, but I feel we don't believe that Bulgaria and Bulgarians can do good stuff and the result is a mix of self-hatred and nationalism :D
Do you feel like Romanians have the same problem
Sometimes I forget that we are literally bordering Turkey and we are right on the doorway to Asia
> No Australia creatures
Hahahaha, best advantage EVER
Lack of sunlight is not good and can lead to depression
It’s totally different if it’s cold but a clear sunny day
IDK if Russia counts as European here, but for me it was fear of prosecution
Russia gone very anti-LGBT in the last decade and back then it was on a verge of passing a law to take away adopted kids form LGBT people
I'm bi and one of my kids is adopted
We packed our stuff and left country as fast at was possible
Actually, this one was so bad it was kinda good
Lots of people who were indifferent to LGBT problems before got really angry at the creators of these ads
Like "wtf do they think we are THAT stupid
Чем же?
Da se izdrusam - Literally "to shake myself"
Da drusam krushata - To shake the pear tree
Da leya tuhli - To pour bricks
Kъртицата рови (kartitsata rovi) - the mole is digging
That's when you really need to go
I dont think its really funny but, "да дряскам" is a close translation to taking a dump
A colleague of mine used to say "I am going to ride the porcelain horse"
да се изтропам (da se iztropam) - to knock myself
[Finally we can go it alone
It was one of the few car models Bulgarians were allowed to buy, so - yeah
Ha, I only knew it as Niva, and it seems they've changed it yet again - it's [Bronto] now
Thanks for clarifying
Wow, what a story this car has with names
This is the one most appalling habit of some Western European countries
I can't really understand how you can stay 16 hours in shoes - and specifically why choose to do so
Do you wear shoes in the toilet
You takes them off near your bed
Sleep with shoes
rakija is meant to be shared
That's the price you pay for going out clubbing
Even in many (most) European countries if you invite someone home at meal time, it is assumed that there will be a meal - otherwise it should be stated explicitly
Even better - choose a different time
Booze and chips is college party
It's cardinal sin in most of Europe as well
Well, when in Rome
But this doesn't change the essence of the habit
Oh, damn near every fairytale featured some beheading, torture or other brutality
There was one story where the dashing hero just so decided to kill the (innocent) kids of three demonesses by jump-scaring them and letting them fall into a firepit
He then went on to mutilate and rob the demonesses and later had to feed the undead in some grave to get some answers
Another hero had to concoct an elaborate plot to sedate and then blind the princess' demon kidnapper
Said hero also had to weigh some gold as compensation for his father's unjust execution
against the weight of his father's head
Heroes were pieces of work even when they didn't kill monsters
It was a frequent motif for them to steal a (often magical) girl's clothes while she was bathing to extort her into marrying them, or killing all her guards just to bang her and then fly away
An evil princess, on the other hand, could have them imprisoned, beaten and tortured if she just didn't like them
Evil siblings abounded and they were usually fine with their brother/sister being killed, which was frequently paid back to them with little hesitation
Oh, and good old racism
Traits not seen in Europeans (dark skin or slanted eyes) were reserved for characters who were monstrous in some manner - servant spirits, cursed kings, evil conquerors, you name it
Can confirm
Also had the un-sugarcoated versions of the Grimm Brothers fairy tales
Not even just that, but a lot of our folk tales don't have a lesson like "be a good person and things will work out", some of them are like "so this guy tricked everyone and got all of their money, he's so clever
", which is in sharp contrast to stories in America where he would certainly learn some kind of lesson about not trying to scam people out of money
lol
Yeah, although if you're referring to Hitar Petar, his exploits most often target either corrupt characters (the priest, the mayor, a cook who was trying to charge him for sniffing the food) or a rival trickster
[I am pretty sure Bulgaria's PM will win
He has a whole arsenal
Edit: I just remembered [THIS] about the current president as well lol
I'm pretty sure it would be someone from eastern europe pulling out a broken rakija bottle and stabbing everyone else
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
and then stealing their suits
Boyko was something like a boxer or something
Maybe just a bodyguard
Either way he'd probably get judo chopped by putin
KGB only teaches you how to torture people
Or was that its predecessors the NKVD
"Don't f*** with me

Haven't heard about it tho, but I wouldn't be surprised, he lies about a lot of things
Literal goat maybe
* Boiling jars with fruits or veggies over an open fire
Roasting huge amounts peppers over an open fire, then boiling them in jars
Making lyutenitsa in big pans over an open fire
Some people still do that, mostly in rural areas, but its getting rarer and rarer
* Romani tinsmiths - they coated the inside of the large cauldrons and pans used above with tin to keep them clean and rust-free
* Dancing bears
I also saw a dancing monkey once
The practice was banned due to animal welfare concerns and the remaining retired dancing bears now live in a sanctuary
Most of the bears were abused, the ropes used to train and handle them were tied to rings pierced through their sensitive noses
They often suffered from malnutrition - I remember a handler asking a kid to throw some bread from the balcony for the bear to eat
* Photographers offering pictures with stuffed roe deers
It was common for children to be photographed like this:
(Yes, that's me looking like a psycho
on a stuffed deer
* Also very cold winters with heavy snow
The winter I was born, the Danube river froze
I think I've seen ONE like that in my life, and I'm 32 years old
There is however someone very, very dedicated to religious posters about hell here in Varna
They're all over the city and I'm told it's one person putting them everywhere
I've never seen anything like it in Bulgaria or other Balkan countries
It seems a distinctly American thing to me
Here religious types are usually fairly low-profile, except for the church higher-ups, who drive fancy sports cars and flash their rolex watches and gold teeth like some kind of cartoon mafia boss (which they are) and everybody hates them
Bold of you to assume the church has any money left after communism
This is so prevalent recently in my town, there's a mad old lady that is glueing them on the back of every road sign
There used to be none, and now the place is littered with them, and police doesn't seem to care (she's been photographed several times by different people, so probably not hard to identify her)
And it's not even feel-good messages like "Jesus is coming", but crudely drawn devil faces with "Don't be part of Satan's play" and similar
And now the newly developed "Covid-19 doesn't exist, it's the Satan's deception" and the like
I can only speculate she's in some religious sect that is helping her, or she's completely gone off her rocker and devoted all her time into this, cause I can't fathom how she's continuing to do it for 5+ years
I've never seen anything like this in any other towns in my country, so I guess it's the work of one person or small group
The one thing that really surprised me in Slovakia was dedicated religious TV channels and even sometimes they would show mass and other rituals on the regular channels
Never seen anything similar anywhere else I’ve been
> Here religious types are usually fairly low-profile
Communism
The last one made me laugh IRL gj
Yeah, and that's a good thing
For Bulgarians it's Macedonian and Serbian
I'd personally struggle with Russian as the grammar is way different, but some people understand it quite a bit
Polish, Czech and Slovak are really different and I'd barely understand a few words
Pretty much all slavic languages if you talk slowly
Written is even better
If you talk slowly I can understand Russian and Slovak
Even more so if it is written
For me, without a formal education in the language, Russian is understandable when written but it's much more challenging when spoken
Maybe I'm just retarded then, my boyfriend of an year and a half is Slovak and neither of us understands the other's language  it's English for us with some Bulgarian and slovak words thrown in for fun
Name days
I have some distant cousins in the US that are third generation emigrants, they can barely speak Bulgarian but they still celebrate their name days
So glad someone said this
I worked with a girl in the states who's grandparents were Bulgarian
she spoke no Bulgarian and had never been
but still celebrated her name day
Yeah, i can totally agree with you
Most of the time we celebrate name days more than our birthdays
Guess it is a regional kink
I don't know about the rest of the Balkans but in Bulgaria it is custom to invite people on your birthday, but on your name day people are meant to ivite themselves and you can't turn them away
I have two name days, so I have three parties a year haha
Баница (Banitsa)
Look it up if you want
It's wonderful food filled with cheese
It's amazing especially when it's homemade
Most iconic: Yogurt
We have our own version of it thanks to a unique bacterium only found in bulgaria
We convinced the chinese that it's the secret to longevity
If only longevity was the cause of our aging population
Most unique/least contested/personal pick: Liutenica
Think of it as a healthier, salty rather than sweet, pepper instead of tomato-based ketchup, and it is delicious
Paired with balkan cheese, 'colour salt' spices, and spread on a slice of bread, it's a culinary masterpiece (no bias at all, I only grew up on this :)
Additional things you might want to check out is boza, a wheat-based creamy sweet drink, banitza, pastry filled typically with cheese (balkan cheese, not that yellow stuff), and tarator, basically what the greeks call tzatziki but made with bulgarian yogurt, garlic, and it's a soup instead of a salad (it's ideal for hot summer weather)
Suma sumarum: We have fantastic food, so please visit/invest to help our weak economy :(
Edit: Am blind, didn't read title
From what I've gathered your most ubiquitous food was smazhaak/fried cheese
Every single food place regardless of general theme, also had this in the menu
The fast food variant is mostly Banichka, what means little (portable) banitsa
It's often purchased with Ayran (yogurt drink) or Boza, that looks like chocolate milk, but it isn't. Try it only if you are brave
Well some people put flags on their house but its not very common and most people dont care if you have one or not
I kid, I kid, but
We are on 64th day of anti-government protests here, in large part catalyzed by these photos taken secretly of our long-standing prime-minister - stacks of 500 euro banknotes and golden bars stashed in his residence drawers (presumably bribes brought by visitors)
Also the paranoid fuck sleeps with a glock on his drawer, despite being guarded by our national security agency - again presumably because he is so deep into schemes with criminals that he's afraid for his life, or the gun is just a habit out of his murky friend-with-racketeers-and-mafia past
There's of course numerous other scandals behind the protests, mostly of corruptional nature, but these leaked photos are known to everyone here these days, so pretty iconic even jokingly
Indeed
And he's the one that got himself there
It was probably his mistress though, he's been very shush about it while not outright denying the photos are real (and independent experts verified they're not photoshopped and from different days, so hard to smuglle ton of money and gold several times just to fake these photo-ops)
Air pollution is one of the biggest problems here
We live in an area that typically has very good air quality but on days when an "inversion" happens and there's no wind, its like looking out into a wall of smog with almost 0 visibility
You can taste it when you breathe, you can feel it stinging your eyes
I worry about all of the little kids who are out breathing this in on these days without a mask
Littering is very commonplace here and with such beautiful nature, it just breaks your heart
A lot of people are getting better about it and having public trashcans helps but seeing people just toss a soda bottle and burger wrapper from their car as they drive along is just so rage-inducing
I don't just don't get how you can be driving along a gorgeous mountain road and simultaneously contribute to it being trashed
The poor infrastructure means you had better have a durable car because you *will* incur damage
I popped 2 tires at the same time on a pothole here a few years ago and it was a huge pain to get a tow and get it dealt with
The highways here are wonderful however and are at a much higher standard than the surface streets
[One of my favourite clips
Not exactly the same thing, but in the 90s a satirical show named Ku Ku did a prank about an accident in the Nuclear Power Plant Kozloduy and a lot of people fell for it which led to the show being cancelled
I guess people fell for it because it was only a few years after Chernobyl and it was on the state TV channel
Plus the interviews with the "military guys" near the NPP does feel a bit like "we are in deep shit fuck off news reporters".
Here's a link with eng subs  -  main stuff begins at 1:25
Bulgaria
Someone help me add the flair, please
The importance of staying in touch with and speaking to the family often
As a kid it always felt like a bit of a chore, and questioned why we had to do it all the time
As an adult, I’m happy I’m very close with my grandparents etc
, and that I got to know everyone as well as I could
It’s now a highlight of my weekend when I call people to catch up
I used to hate dairy, and we're pretty notable for our dairy products, especially yoghurt
Now, I don't eat dairy *but* I really appreciate the yoghurt every once in a while
It is completely different from other varieties of yoghurt I've eaten abroad and has a sacred place in my heart
Cyrillic was created by Slavs, for Slavs
Like it or not, it's what peak performance looks like
As someone not living in Bulgaria currently, whenever I go back home, I’m always pleasantly surprised by our diary
I live in North America, which does help explain my surprise and delight
It tends to be very 'fluffy', like American bread, at least from supermarkets
I don't know about bakeries
It doesn't have much 'body' to it
Thank you
And success
No offense to any Americans, but the stuff they call yoghurt makes me want to cry
(No real experience with other North American countries though)
I'm from Bulgaria
But yes, it's a big part of the food culture here haha
I've tried American Greek yoghurt, and it tastes like sugar
I haven't really had too much cheese besides string cheese and that orange shredded cheese
And I admit, the ice cream (specifically Ben and Jerry's) is amazing
But ice cream is meant to be somewhat processed and sugary
That's fine hahaha, our flags are pretty similar
Not sure whether it counts as fast food or just a restaurant chain but I would love for the Bulgarian chain Happy to open in the UK city I moved to
They have great sushi and fish specialities in general
I was about to say Hesburgers but we have em here In Bulgaria
Nadias Sandwich from Denmark
Was always my go-to if I ever craved fast food
Bulgarian "happy" in the Netherlands
I know there's one in Spain
There is Hesburger in Bulgaria, but it is worse than McDonald's. I don't know if this is the general situation or just the local franchises
More specifically, in non-UK Europe English
1 The Byzantine empire/ Greece
The Ottoman empire / Turkey
Serbia
USSR/Russia
Romania
From most mentioned to least mentioned the top 5 would probably be:
Byzantium
Ottoman empire
Soviet Union
Germany
Macedonia (region)
1)Byzantine Empire - we had a bunch of wars and we made them pay us
2)Ottoman Empire - enslaved us
3)Serbia - we had a bunch of wars and we won most of them
4)Greece - not the country but their culture and Orthodox Christianity, a bit like a continuation of the Byzantines
5)Russia - they fought "for us" and they kinda did but then Alexander III didn't like our knyz since he didn't want to be a puppet
Most indoctrinated communists still believe that they freed us from the "fascist, classist and bourgeoisie" Tsar Boris III
Not including modern day North Macedonia which basically split from Bulgaria in the early 20th century the list would be
1 - Byzantium/Greece - our relation with them for some solid 350 years was 'war/short peace/war'. Bulgaria was also conquered by the Byzantines for about 150 years
2 - The Ottoman Empire/Turkey - we were part of the Ottomans for 480 years
Anything from their administrative/religious/cultural/etc aspects is studied regarding these two
3 - Serbia - neighbors, we've had a fair share of wars between us
4 - Romania - again neighbors, was under Bulgarian control in the First and some decades of the Second Bulgarian Tsardom
5 - Kievan Rus/Russia/USSR - we've had some early touching points like 970s occupation of Bulgaria by the Kievans, later in the 18th/19th/20th centuries Russia/USSR played played massive role in Bulgaria
I don't think so
It's a free market
Games like CS:GO, Apex Legends, Fortnite and more are free2play, because lootboxes exist
If people want to spend money for skins, let them do it
Absolutely
The whole world should get rid of these fucking (non-cosmetic) microtransactions
the problem is a) kids for many obvious reasons and b) people with mental gambling problems
Pathological gamblers and the easily addicted are wonderful prey for the gam(bl)ing industry's 'whale hunters'. These are direct terms used by said industry, btw, as in 'prey' and 'whales'. This isn't trust fund billionares throwing excess money away, it's erakwilled, mentally ill people whose issues are being supported and exploited by a predatory industry
The way things are going with the far right taking over, with the USA and Britain as a prime example, probably in a world war

If you're right I'll apologise for being wrong
One of our politicians went to a meeting with Trump carrying a [Billa bag] Since then the Billa bag incident has turned into a cult for the aesthetic people, such as this [lady]
Probably North Macedonia , there are like our little brother
Bulgaria and North Macedonia
It's a complicated relationship :)
Macedonia is like our little brother
We always wish the best for him but his manipulative ex wife convinced him to change his last name and turned him against us so now he cries foul when we try to remind him that we are family
Lol shout out to Bulgaria when they fought every neighbor at the same time
I've actually heard the comparison made that France and Belgium's relationship is comparable to that of Bulgaria and (North) Macedonia
But of course, even mentioning the two countries in the same sentence is how wars can begin on the Balkans lol (feel free to check r/AskBalkans to get a glimpse)
Linguistically and culturally we're extremely similar
I wouldn't say *the same*, no, but extremely similar, for a variety of reasons
And I can't remember ever having a war with (North) Macedonia
Controversy, scandal, arguments both in schollary circles, government, and among random strangers
Plenty of those
We get heated
But we've yet to actually try and murder each other on the basis of national agenda
I think
(Which is *very* rare for the Balkans)
We share a lot of culture, history, music, national heroes, etc
to the point of fights about who has the right to claim what for themselves and how one country is "stealing" them from the other
Though that is not uncommon for all of the Balkans
Literally no one calls it like that, except Romanians
Dude you guys are our brothers
I don't care what anyone says
Not rent, no
It's pretty much expected that if you have a **full-time job** (after graduating) and live with your parents you'd chip in for expenses - either covering specific bills yourself (phone, cable, internet) or helping with the total expenses (buying groceries, paying part of the electricity bill, etc
If you have a **part-time job**, even if it's a very cosy paycheck, but you're not in the career-building stage of your life (e.g: you're still in university), the only thing you'd be expected to pay is probably an errand from the store here and there
You'd only be asked to help with expenses only if your family is struggling
Likewise, parents here will bleed themselves dry to help their children financially
If the "child" has a job while living with them, it's like a milestone towards financial independence - no longer needing any allowance, handling all personal expenses alone, etc
Russian with a Turkish accent is the most hilarious and at the same time infuriating comparison I've heard
The most infuriating description I've heard was "Russian spoken with a toothache
Thank you Albania, for having such nice people who are so kind and hospitable even when you are abroad
Well regardless of what Russia has become, we still have a blood debt to the Russians for freeing us from 500 years of ottoman slavery
What exactly did we try to conquer/take from you
Come on :P y'all are already so big
Do you really need dobrudzhja
Just kidding :P
Same
That's meant to be like a thank you :P just sounds more severe, but I guess that's typical for our people
Nah you know what, Romanian is a beautiful language
I noticed we have some good ties regardless of some history
There's a street in your capital named after one of our national heroes and I bet there's more
Its how different we are that makes us so interesting and great
Don't be Bulgarian, y'all are awesome the way you are :P

I can hear the Bulgarian accent ...
i hate the "th" sound
109th day of protests against government and prosecutor
P.M. apparently got covid and is resting at home
Information is muffled, like nothing is happening while shit is hitting the fan hard
We've been in this song and данс before
>Berlin
Ach, Berlin
There were strikes such as roadblocks on major roadways, crossroads, highways and city entrances
Capital centre is blocked almost every night
Interestingly emough, police are also protesting, demanding higher salaries
Depends
We have general universities that teach many things and then we have specialized universities, focusing on specific fields of study
|Field of study|University|
|Arts|National Academy of Arts|
|Music|Prof
Pantcho Vladigerov State Music Academy|
|Film and theatre|Krastyo Sarafov National Academy For Theatre and Film Arts|
|General studies (sciences, law, history, linguistics etc
)|Sofia University Sveti Kliment Ohridski|
|Architecture|University of Architecture, Civil Eng
and Geodesy|
|Medicine|Military Medical Academy and Sofia Medical University|
|Engineering|Sofia Technical University|
|Sport|Vasil Levski Sports Academy|
|Economy|University of National and World Economy|
|Military|Georgi Sava Rakovski Military Academy|
I gotta tell you the only thing the Academy of arts speciazes in is producing alcoholics
Other than SU Kliment Ohridski, no universities even feature in QS international ranking, I wouldn't really say higher education is particularly prestigious in Bulgaria
Pretty much any degree from a 3rd tier university anywhere in Western Europe is praised more than whatever education you can get in Bulgaria
Even SU has significant problems in some faculties
Isn't that the case for most artists
I once heard  Gredi Assa telling a story about some models arriving on the entrance exam for "Fashion" and he asked them: "Where are your pencils, ladies
" and they replied: "But we came here to strut the runway"
True, but an architecture degree from UASG will mean more to any employer than an architectural degree from Varnenski Svoboden
I would politely dissagree
" Pretty much any degree from a 3rd tier university anywhere in Western Europe is praised more than whatever education you can get in Bulgaria " - definitely not true, at least not for third tier
First tier - yes, second tier - maybe in some cases
But yeah, it's not very prestigious
But I honestly like that, I wouldn't want it to be like with high schools, where people obsess over getting into "elite schools"
Oh boy the things I've seen
There used to be a sculpture classroom that was basically treated as a pub
We'd buy like 6-10 liters of beer and spend the whole day drinking and no one even bothered hiding the bottles
You could smoke almost everywhere
I've seen teachers leaving the bathrooms reeking of weed
And I can hardly imagine the things I haven't seen
[Here] is the data about UASG and [here] about Varna regarding architecture degrees
As you can see from the official data from our ministry of education, the difference is not really that much - 70% graduated from UASG end up working in the sector compared to 63% from Varna
The salaries from Varna graduates are pretty much the same, even slightly higher
Yes, UASG is slightly better but if the difference from the bottom of the list to the top of the list is only the difference between 63% employment and 70% employment, is it really that meaningful to employers
In my company, the management doesn't make a difference between universities abroad
It's pretty much "OMG this person studied abroad, let's call him for an interview
". The university doesn't really matter
I really don't think this is unique to my company either
I also studied abroad and no one ever questioned the quality of my unversity, people always say "you went abroad, obviously your education is much better". I actually agree that it is better but people rarely put it to a test which I find weird
Ohh, can I ask what field you're in and your major
I work in the field of IT, major is also from the field
Oh shit
I may become your colleague :D
If it weren't for the Russians it would just be another region of Romania along with Transnistria
From my limited view both sides would like that to happen, but y'know
well, none of your neighbors have Tatratea
I never remember those two apart
Yeah, I know
It wasn't a dig at the Moldovan identity
Just saying they seem way more friendly and brotherly compared to, for example, our relations with N.Macedonia
Formal speak to family is considered very offensive
About 43 on that corruption index, I honestly expected worse
It's pretty bad, especially the justice system, which is why it's so difficult to hold officials accountable, despite all the petitions, protests and journalist investigations in the world
very corrupt
Let's say that we are the most corrupted country in Europe
Between 0 (Iceland) and 10 Russia/Turkey, we're prolly a solid 6
For me it has to be [this] It's a harvest song from Thrace
Very haunting
Edit: Alternate [link]
For me it has to be something from Pancho Vladigerov - the most influential Bulgarian composer, and the one that managed to combine best our traditional folk music with classical one
[Pancho Vladigerov - Vardar - Bulgarian Rhapsody] is the most majestic and widely loved one
[Pancho Vladigerov - Op
36 No
4 Improvisation] for a more calmer, contained one, a personal favorite
edit: Actually the biggest crowd favorite here:
["Oblache le byalo"] - has numerous versions by many artists, popular among everyone probably
Think "Auld Lang Syne" popularity
Oh yeah, Yann Tiersen
This guy is a national treasure of yours
Nah I think it's [this]
I prefer [this] but yours cool too
Beautiful :')
She is wonderful, thank you
Sandu Ciorba is a legend, I don't care what anyone says
[another favorite]
If someone can answer why his hair always looks like he just dipped it in bacon grease though that would be awesome
I am ... confused
Tavener
I bawl my eyes out every time when I watch Children of Men
Ummm, I think you mean [this]
Idk how these videos came out of such a homophobic country lmao
That one is great too
I found it hard to pick one since there are so many amazing songs
Sorry, someone posted another one, try [this]
Why not try our local version for double the confusion triple the cringe
You win
i dont know how to beat this one
kakoi tui be brat
Of course no one can beat such peak artistic excellence
Тоя в началото като се обърна с гипсираната ръка и разбрах че предстои нещо много специално
Because of school/uni, I live in a big city on a semi-permanent basis(vacations and quarantine notwithstanding) and it's alright
I can have walks more than 10 minutes long and there are a lot more stores to waste my time in
London - Over crowded , ugly , overpriced and life is very rushed its like everyone is in a hurry ... because they always are also have to travel alot to find a decent holiday spot, benefits include alot of money opportunities but the taxes and rent will take any money you make anyway
Plovdiv - Very chill and relaxed, beautiful city , close to any holiday destinations from Greece to the Black sea or a mountain holiday however wages are disgustingly low unless you have a very high education but at the same time everything is cheap anyway
Fairly cheap compared to zone 1 or compared to other european countries because i mean £12 at lets say Nandos for half a chicken with chips isnt exactly worth it but its cheap for London standards
North Macedonia
Obviously the country exists, but because for a big chunk of time in the past it was a part of Bulgaria and it's full of ethnic Bulgarians, the joke is that there's no such thing as a country (North) Macedonia
Perhaps this will shine some light on why The Balkans are a hot zone
So much territory changed hands between the years that everyone can claim anything here
I hope that this post will be taken as humorous and not insulting
**Bulgar (pre-Christian) names:** Kubrat, Asparukh, Kormesiy, Kormisosh, Vineh, Telets, Sabin, Umor, Toktu, Pagan, Kardam, Malamir, Saver, Tervel, Telerig, Presian, Omurtag, Krum, Boris, Rasate
**Christian names:** Vladimir, Simeon, Samuil, Presiyan, Dobromir, Kaloyan, Asen, Petar, Konstantin, Ivan, Ivaylo, Koloman, Georgi, Shishman, Yoan, Smilets, Mihail, Georgi, Aleksandar
**Female names - royal consorts and female sebastocratic rulers:** Desislava, Elena, Petritsa, Irina, Anastasiya, Mariya, Mariya Survuvul, Agata, Yakvinta, Anna, Kira, Teodora, Yoanna, Eleonora, Margarita
Alexander, Ferdinand, Boris, Simeon, only considering more recent history
OP also mentioned in a comment that it can be a ruler born on the territory of the present day state (from a predecessor state)
So you can add the Thrace-born Roman emperor Galerius and Odrysian king Teres
That really expands the possibilities: Orpheus, Seth, Odrys etc
Boris, Krum, Asparukh, Presian and Tervel are still popular to this day
The rest
not so much, but they are very epic indeed
We have a cold soup called tarator - it consists of yoghurt, cucumbers, garlic, salt, dill and maybe walnuts
The debate is about whether the cucumber should be grated or cubed
I personally belong to the grated gang - not only is it faster than dicing, but the texture is also better imo
How to call small platic bags
"Plikche" vs "Torbichka" is the West-East divide that I know from where I've lived
There are also some heathens in the middle that call them "sackche", but I pay them no mind because that's preposterous - there can only be two names for it
There's also the old-fought war whether to call peppers "piperka" or "chushka"
Kebapche or Kufte (pronounced kyufte and literally means meatball)
Mayo
Haven't heard of the other kind
In my book, milk doesn't go in tea at all
It is indeed
Even better with a grated cucumber
The thing that surprised me the most after I moved from Moscow to Bulgaria is when I lived in Russia everything around was in Russian
Settings on a washing machine
In Russian
Instructions on a shampoo bottle
Russian
List of ingridients on food package
Russian
Here it can be any random european language - german, greek, polish, whatever
They just slap shitty unreadable piece of paper with Bulgarian translation on it and call it day
My washing mashine settings are french
I don't speak any french and never thought that it is a thing that you need to check for before buying
Manual - yes, I'm taking about text on the surface on electronics
I had to goole wtf is "repassage facile", lol
We have quite some songs that might fit some of the description in the OP, but it’s hard to think of a single example of a song that was as massive as Despacito
I guess in recent years this is a good candidate:
[Krisko feat
Slavi Trifonov - Gleday kak se pravi]
2 of the biggest names in Bulgarian music collaborating, a really catchy song and to top it off, a mini dance craze, as well
Was everywhere in 2018
In the pre-digital era, I think this stands out:
[Ivana - Neshto netipichno]
I don’t think there’s a single Bulgarian who cannot sing along to at least the chorus (even though I’m sure many are ashamed to admit it), and I’m I’m talking from toddlers to retirees
Easily remains one of the biggest songs of this century here
Yeah, that was the same in Bulgaria with that song
It was everywhere, even people who don’t actively listen to music were talking about it
Luda po tebe is definitely on the same level as Neshto netipichno, it’s an evengreen
Hayde, opa doesn’t come close tho, it’s not even among the biggest hits of Andrea here
Well, Ukrainian being a Slavic language certainly helps, some of the words are identical to Bulgarian, but overall it’s a difficult language to get when you have to exposure to it (it’s no Serbian or Russian, with which Bulgarians are way more familiar)
The message definitely wasn’t lost, tho, the video made it pretty clear, too
These bridges, funded with EU money, cost 134000 €.
Well, you can see everywhere some projects that look amazing like some stadiums and sports centres, but it takes about centuries and millions of years to be made
And lack of money
It's sad to see
M5 in Istanbul is 100% automatic and it runs really well
Maybe they can hire Mitsubishi/CAF to build a good automation
Read russian
Cyrillic ain't russian
Of course
And you can't be mad about it
It's one of the few truly great things Bulgarian, I ain't about to just let it pass and be falsely known as someone else's. Toxic nationalism is bad, but this is not the case here
It's just as ignorant as americans saying they invented pizza
You already said what it means in English, then
You literally edited your comment to transliterate "мир". Transliterate, not translate
From one alphabet to another, not from one language to another
From cyrillic to latin, not from russian to "mir".
I guess I noticed an "issue" before looking for one
Have a nice day
We have it in Bulgarian and it's more like the one who brightens the world
Maybe not many people know, but the very first computer was created in Bulgaria from a guy by the name of John Atanasov
I see a Romanian here also claiming insulin
It was invented in the USA by an American, who had Bulgarian father
Yes, excuse me
You're right
Meant by a bulgarian not in Bulgaria, sorry
Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, Assassin's Creed Rogue, Tropico 3-5, Surviving Mars, Phoenix Point and Total War Saga: Troy
Also S.T.A.L.K.E.R is one of my favourite games
Looking forward to S.T.A.L.K.E.R 2
Tropico 3, 4 and 5 were developed by Haemimont Games and are pretty popular
They also made Surviving Mars, which also did pretty well
Assassin's Creed Liberation and Rogue were developed by Ubisoft Sofia
And I just found out that Total War Saga: Troy, which just came out recently was developed in Bulgaria by Creative Assembly Sofia
Still, no Bulgarian publishers
Only developers
But it still works for me
I've been playing Witcher 3 for days now and the one thing I don't like about it is Gwent
I wish I could just get all of those Gwent missions to just move to the failed list and get out of the way
Which Assassin's Creed
There's been a ton of them and I know the first one (called just "Assassin's Creed") was from Ubi's Montreal studios
Please watch it with subtitles and not dubbed
I would like to thank Greece and Turkey for managing their tourism way better than us (Bulgaria)
In this context we're very, very stupid
All of my friends who went to Greece or Turkey on a holiday had a  great time
I'd like to thank Romania and Greece for having our backs in terms of international politics when we need them
Cheers, mates
I hope the Craiova Group can prosper together
Err
I'd like to thank the black sea for always being our coast sea
I want to thank all our neighbours for trying to forget our history and live in peace+food
How about Switzerland
I guess no one remembers the relocations of bulgarians out of southern Thrace anymore
It's not very popular, but as far as I know, it's unique for Bulgaria
It's called [Етър] (Etar) and it's basically caramel flavoursed soda drink
Before Coca Cola and Pepsi became ubiquitous and before new brands of drinks were established, the main flavours of drinks were lemonade, blueberry and etar
The alcoholic drinks we share with the rest of the Balkans - the rakia, the wine etc
Not at all
Many old (and a not-insignificant number of young) people openly romanticise our communist past, completely disregarding the concentration camps, indoctrination, the complete Soviet dominance over our affairs and the fact that bananas were considered a luxury
Even the more controversial parts of the Regime (like the attempt to ethnically cleanse the 13% of the population of Turkish descent) are quite often justified by communist nostalgists, if not straight-up praised
Well, mate, as far as I know, there are no games translated in Bulgarian
Games are always played best in their original language
If it's English (as is true for most), I play in English
If it's another language, I play in that language with subtitles
I think your question would be better about films/TV series
Never seen a "Bulgarian" option available but I have played the Sims in French and Russian at times, for practice's sake - it doesn't risk me fucking up the storyline or not understanding something important quite as much as an RPG would
Besides that exception, always English - if I can read a book in its original text, I would
Same goes for video games
I'd never live to see a decent translation to Bulgarian, except maybe if I do it myself
Either way, it loses something and I think translations for games are spoiling people in a way
And depriving them of the original experience
Minecraft is translated into bulgarian but its annoying when you have to search for an item and you have to change your keyboard to bulgarian and change it back to english for the commands or to speak if you are in english speaking server
Thats why i play on English even though my language is available
Some people put their games and lots of other things like TVs,Car menus etc in Russian so they can understand it better especially older peoples who learned russian
I once got diablo 2 in only French
I was so fucking angry
Pretty much the same way - dumb, backwards and populist oligarch voter base
This is the first time I have seen or heard about it
In recent years, i think in the Burgas Airport al qaeda made an anti-zionism terrorist attack
This happened back in 2012, only seven people died but i cant remember anything else, except back in 1925 when the bulgarian communist party blew up a church and killed 200 people and injured 500
Also, all of my prayers and thoughts go to the Lebanese people and the ones affected by it
The [2008 Chelopechene explosions] has to be there as well - a massive explosion just 10km away from the center of the capital Sofia
It obliterated a military depot with a total of 1,494 tonnes of ageing artillery shells, rocket propelled grenades, depth charges, hand grenades and other explosives
Thankfully only 3 people were injured, as it happened in the early hours of the morning and said depot was not in active use, just used as storage for the old materials
OK here we go:
NM - let's just get rich first and stop the bleeding of our people
We deserve to have honorable lives
Romania - we respect the will of the Romanians and I must say you've pushed me to set the bar high when it comes to fighting corruption
Netherlands - thank you for the education, much more in life than in knowledge
The structure and order in your country has inspired me to bring some of that here
Greece - I hope we can extend our arms even further than today and create common history positively more often
Last poll I saw, on the question "which country you like the most" something like 45% of the asked people had picked Romania as their first choice
So yeah that's good results I guess
Happy Martisor btw
If you can read this, you are too old to drink milk
We need a Korova milk bar
I am vegan, but even before that i wasn't a huge fan of milk
Ah, the toddlers these days
They first learn to write, than read
В гъза на географията. In geography's ass
We say 'in the ass of geography'
Regarding a specific place, I've heard Zanzibar, bacause it no longer exists as a country like before
But it is very rarely used
На майка си в гъзо/На майка си в путката - In its mother's ass/pussy
"Na maika si putkata" or as you gentlemen would know it "at its mother's privates"
Bulgarians eat snails too
Frogs I do not know
Lol try Georgian
You sold since of the archives to us
Really
That would actually be pretty great
Because on average our streets are narrow and can’t feed a building that big
Also, because they are ugly, compared to 100+ years old buildings and people don’t like the contrast
Streets in a lot cities are made hundreds of years before skyscrapers existed,  they are narrow and not very straight, so it would be very hard to build a building as huge as a skyscraper all also they are ugly and stand out way too much for an old city center with old beautiful buildings
In Sofia in particular, there is regulation about how tall a building should be
This thing was made to preserve the view of Vitosha mountain as it's the most precious view for every citizen in the city
Yes there are skyscrapers but they don't overshadow the look of the mountain
I am not sure but i think it was "gotov ili ne , az idvam". Havent played the game in years so i am not 100% if that was the phrase
Готов или не идвам аз
Готов или не, аз идвам!
Готов или не, аз идвам
Bulgarian
***"Готов или не, идвам!"*** Which is closer to ***"Ready or not, I'm coming"*** but they are basically the same thing so
Готов или не, аз идвам or Готов или не, ето ме, идвам OR Готов или не, идвам!
We don't have 3 ways to say it, it's just how i think it's possible to say it
The three ways of saying it are almost the same, but have a slight difference
it means the same thing as the title asks for, ready or not here i come
Oh my god are you kidding
So amazing i didn't know that
лопата in bulgarian too :DD
Well, there is a community of Bessarabian Bulgarians in Moldova
They speak similar to our Bulgarian and honestly they are so cute when they speak it and I feel somewhat proud when I hear their version of the same language
I don't understand how Romanians always drive like they are in race
Even their truckdrivers in the mountains
I just can't understand it
Greece: How can you have so beautiful cities and yet all your buildings are covered in graffiti
Turkey: For a Muslim country you really are selling a lot of alcohol
Also why when you buy alcohol you put it in newspaper or some kind of paper to hide it
Also why are you following a dictator who led your country to misery
I remember going there for example in 2011 and it was so modernized everything and people were very friendly and approachable especially with women, now I am afraid to go there without my mom or my man(and I am in my mid 20s)
Macedonia: Why do you hate us
I know it's politics but just why
Also pls don't take so seriously our jokes about you and how we want your lands
I think it's more the idea that you have your vacation in another country
There are many Bulgarians that dislike our beaches and they like to go to Greece, Turkey some to Romania I have heard
Also I believe the industry and the government are trying to attract more foreign tourists because the Bulgarian will never pay 10-15 euros for umbrella and sun bed (if this is how it is called) on a beach that is suppose to be free for everyone
We drive the same way though
Probably, just that what I have noticed about the Romanian drivers
Oh that is my favorite, then he rides right behind me very close like it's going to make me drive faster
* We call scotch tape "tikso" after the Tixo brand;
* We call diapers "pampersi" after the Pampers brand;
* We call dishwashing liquid "vero" after the Vero brand;
* We call copying machines "kseroksi" after the Xerox brand;
* We call SUVs and 4x4 vehicles "dzhipove" after the Jeep brand;
* We call hot tubs "dzhakuzita" after the Jacuzzi brand
Most of these brand names didn't really became words for the producrts due to popularity, but because they were the first brands to offer said product in Bulgaria
There's many but I can only think of one right now - Ксерокс (kseroks/Xerox) for photocopier - it's a word we use more than "Копирна машина" (copying machine), because as you might guess, Xerox is the first and most popular brand for those here
We use it even for other brands of photocopying machines
There's also a verb with it, although it's (fortunately) not as common - Може ли да направиш Ксерокс на този лист? - "Can you make a Xerox of this paper sheet
Edit: other examples I can think of right now are Jeep and Pampers
Yup - the "provintsiya". The dreaded word describing everything beyond Sofia's Ring Road
I moved to Germany after I got my bachelor's degree back home
Was doing language course for a hole year (9:00 to 13:00 every weekday) and there was another bulgarian girl
We both thought it was safe to be our R-rated selfs and talk shit all day long
Well the year goes by and I'm doing my oral exam
We finish up and one of our reachers calls me up and starts to talk to me in bulgarian as if she was never a german teacher  ... I wished for instant death, but I could just stay  there ... get super red and have a blank stare in my face
Unsurprising, but weird: Гадже (*gadzhe*, dzh sound like in judge) is established Bulgarian slang for boyfriend or girlfriend, and it comes from the Romani word for "non-Roma person". No comment on how it probably ended up that way
Бъбрек, бюрек, чаршаф и чорапи are also used in Bulgarian, but бакър, пешкир and челик are considered archaic/old-fashined and you can only hear them out of the mouths of old people (or peasants, which is almost synonymous)
*Shubler*, *shaiba*, *shina*, *shur* and *shantsa* (ski jumping thing) are also used in Bulgarian
We probably got them from German in the same time period
> шлагбаум
Also, don't forget штраф and вокзал.
Ковчег means coffin in modern Bulgarian, but the older meaning can be seen in the diminutive ковчеже (small money chest, mainly seen in pirate movies) and ковчежник (treasurer of an organisation)
>  I'm pretty certain that it's either a Latin loan or a proto-Indo-European cognate
My *Dictionary of Foreign Words in the Bulgarian Language* says it was borrowed from the French *plage*, which in turn comes from the Italian *piaggia*.
Were they *ahem* hungry
Fairly popular among young people
On the other hand, most adults above 40 years old think that cannabis is as bad as heroine while they drink spirits every evening
A lot of hypocrites here
Yep
Biggest problem is that the majority of the medical community is among those adults, too
And as a result, weed is still criminalised and heavily stigmatised but nobody really bats an eye at *cigarettes*, even if the person smoking them is like 14
Its really easy to find weed if you search for it even in smaller towns such as mine which has around 70-80k population but that doesn't change the fact that majority of people here think that weed is a demonic creature
Even intelligent people who are a bit older have little to no information about the pros and cons of cannabis
I would say that countries in Eastern Europe percieve weed in a similar way
Most youngsters have tried at least once and most adults around middle age and above see it as as the worst thing ever
I mean they are right, if you are serious about sports best to stay away from weed and alcohol
We use the Cyrillic - it has a letter for every sound, so there is no variations in spellings
There are names that have variations tho:
* Tsvetlin(a)
* Tsvetelin(a)
* Tsvetoslav(a)
* Tsvetlomir(a)
* Svetlin(a)
* Svetomir(a)
* Svetomil(a)
* Svetlomir(a)
* Svetloslav(a)
* Svetlomir(a)
* Yoan(a)
* Yovan(a)
* Ivan(a)
* Dragomir(a)
* Dragoslav(a)
* Dobromir(a)
* Dobroslav(a)
And so on
Only rarely, Bulgarian is too much of a phonetic language
Whether a name is spelled with я (ya) or a (Kristiyan/Kristian), or with a single/double n (Ana/Anna)
That's about it
Yes because in Croatian (and all Slavic languages that use the Latin alphabet) the letter C makes the sound of the German letter Z, not K.
As a Bulgarian who did something similar, I studied in the Netherlands are recently came back home
I work online now and make a very decent chunk of money out of my education
Hoping to start a business soon
I spent most of 2019 living in Germany and Austria
I liked both but Austria is nicer tbh
In Russian koleja is still used for these grooves
And allthough usual railroads are "iron road", "zheleznaya doroga", narrow gauge is uzkokolejka - narrow grooves
I wouldn't say for miles and miles
But a dozen kilometres yes
Yes, the mountains, but only I think Strandzha, the Rhodopes and Stara Planina the others have a lot of tourists
Bulgaria
Yes
Netherlands where I reside
Everything is both populated and synthetic
Wildernis hasn't existed here since the 1600s
It wouldn't be controversial if they were just born abroad, but if they had longstanding connection with another country, it would definitely be controversial
For example, Sergei Stanishev, a former prime minister who was born in Kherson (today in Ukraine, then in the USSR), got a lot of flak for retaining Russian citizenship and not even acquiring Bulgarian citizenship until he was thirty
He was accused of not taking Bulgarian citizenship to avoid military service
And of course the president of Bulgaria must be a Bulgarian citizen by birth
Which currently means at least one of parent must be a Bulgarian citizen, but in earlier times the requirements were stricter
For example, Georgi Pirinski was a candidate for president in 1996, until the Constitutional court ruled him ineligible, because at the time (1948) those born abroad were Bulgarian citizens by birth either if both of their parents were Bulgarian citizens or they did not gain another citizenship by birth
And Pirinski, being born in the US with a Bulgarian father and a Slovenian mother was out of luck
Well, our former head of states and kings/tsars have been born in different countries and they have done decent jobs, so I think the majority will like him/her
Small independent ones, whose journalists, editors and owners get beat  in the streets, have their card set on fire etc
Oldest friend of Bulgaria
I guess Romania
Why I don't really know
Probably because they started out under our empire until we lost dominion over those areas
Only one, when my ancestors came there was only the Byzantium Empire (who were our enemies till the Ottomans came, and then the Ottomans became our enemy) and some slavs who are our only friends
Well you freed us
But I wouldn't call it friends, more like friendly
We just have a blood-debt to you guys
You just weren't the nicest in history to us so that's why we're friendly, not superfriends
Yes
That's what our sense of humour is like
Racist joke's? Yes
Sexism
Yes
Jewish jokes
Yes
Sarcastic ones
Yes
Joking about sex
Yes
Is it raw, rude sex humour
He'll, yeah
Jokes about extended family
Prejudice
Yes, yes, and yes to jokes about stupid superiority over other nations which are in fact at our expense
You name it - we approve of it
Yes
Lol we have those people in the Balkans too
Same, Romanian bro
Bulgaria:During the comunist period the country was better and they ruined the country
Large plastic bags from BILLA
It's hard to explain
our entire government is a fucking meme
Yes because what ever Merkel says Boyko will follow, also Macedonia and Serbia because of Macedonia's bullshit
Well at least in the Balkans it's very common
Bulgaria, parliament parties:
BSP - largely unreformed communists
Economically left (not really far left); socially they would be mildly progressive on paper but the leaders are extremely conservative (nationalistic, anti-lbgt, anti-refugees)
EU MEPs do not follow PES in votes
Mixed bag regarding EU integration and Russia
DPS - formally liberal, in practice a mafia owned party that collects a lot of Turkish minority vote through scaremongering
Member of ALDE, EU MEPs vote accordingly
Part of almost every government in the last few decades
GERB - center right populists, ruling in the last 11 years, during which country fell to worst ratings for corruption and press freedom, economic growth mostly halted
Formally strong pro EU, at least as long as they receive EU money
Mildly socially conservative, centrist economically
Volya - single personality, single issue (cheap fuel
) right wing populists
Mostly political bargainer without own agenda
United Patriots (VMRO + Attack, I think they split lately) - far right, with visible traits of fascism
Obviously extremely socially conservative, largely interventionallistic economically
Part of government
Anti EU, very pro Russia
Outside of parliament but notable:
Democratic Bulgaria - coalition that claims to be liberal but main component is DSB, Christian right party
Minor party is Da BG, that claims to be liberal, and The Greens, who are tiny and claim to be green
Member of EPP (!), the only MEP consistently votes oppositely to the election platform  that sent him (but in accordance with his native DSB, I guess)
To answer the last question in the original post - no, I don't really feel there is a choice among Bulgarian political parties that matches my views enough to say I support them
When I vote, it's mostly the least bad choice
Who would you say is the least bad choice right now
If elections were today, personally, I'd vote for "Yes, Bulgaria
" even though I don't like all the parties in their coalition
Maybe if "Save Sofia" makes a political party for the next elections, they'd get my vote
Tsar's party was NDSV (note that I am just transliterating, not translating the abbreviations)
It ruled in the beginning of the millennium, after that had worse result and participated in coalition with BSP and then fell out the parliament and became largely irrelevant (Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha had retired by this time)
Policies were largely liberal-centrist, not without major corruption scandals
Curious facts: Simeon II was one of two monarchs in history to be later democratically elected as head of government and he is last living person who bore the title tsar
The first one was Simeon I of Bulgaria, in 912
I have voted for Reformers / Democratic Bulgaria  on all partisan elections since they exist and have been disappointed every single time
Probably still the least bad choice, but it is getting harder to pick
I sometimes ride the train to my town even though driving is faster and sometimes even cheaper (when with passengers), I just really like trains and want to give the national railway company a few more rides to that destination to make sure they don't close the route
**Almost everybody:**
Personal name + Father's name + Father's Family name
**People whose father's don't recognise them:**
Personal name + Mother's name + Mother's family name
Patronymic and family names end with -ov, -ev, -ski for males and -ova, -eva, -ska for females, while the very rare -ich is used for both genders
Matronymic names are build with the suffixes -in for males and -ina for females
**Examples:**
|Name example|Translation|
|Ivaylo Krumov Asparuhov |Ivaylo, son of Krum of the family of Asparuh |
|Desislava Peycheva Dimitrova|Desislava, daughter of Peyko of the family of Dimitar|
|Boris Stoynev Zografski|Boris, son of Stoyno of the family of the  Zograf (church painter)
-ski and -ki suffixes are often used for family names
designating professions (ex
Smith)|
|Parvan Penkin Ivanov|Parvan, son of Penka of the family of Ivan|
|Albena Marinkina Yavorova|Albena, daughter of Marinka of the family of Yavor|
Bulgarian here
We have a first name, father's name as a middle one, and a family name from the dad's side again
In the case of a single mother, the kid gets it's middle and last name from her
Our middle and last names usually end in -ov for men, -ova for women
Since fairly recently, some parents have started giving two first names to their offspring
I think if you want to do that, they have to be hyphenated, for example Maria-Magdalena
One given name, one paternal name (the name of your father + "оv/ova" suffix), and a surname (either the name of your paternal grandfather +"ov/ova" suffix or your father's surname, but not both)
First name - just a regular first name
Middle/Father's name - The name of your father, usually ending in -ов (-ov) (or even an -a appended)
Last/Family name - The name of the family, sometimes a profession or a name of an ancestor
ends in -ов, -ова, -ски or -ска, although the latter 2 are more rare
Marriage name (I don't know how to call it) - It's optional and it's appended to the last name using a dash
It's only for when women get married and it's the last name of their partner
I'd add that **-ski/ska** could also be applied to toponymic names, **e.g:** Ohridski (of Ohrid), Sofiyska (of Sofia), etc
though I haven't seen these last names applied often outside of history or religion
Also the Armenian disapora here is exempt from changing their last name to end in a gendered way, as they usually end with **-yan/ian** which I find pretty interesting, as they still fit in pretty well with our system, as that's just their version of -ov/a, -ev/a, etc
I believe you could (or at least back in the day, prior to the 90s) use your patronym instead of your family name
I've met quite a few people in their 50s who do this, unless absolutely necessary, though currently if anyone used that it'd be pretty weird and probably considered incorrect information
I don't know about your family but I find it interesting that, for a lot of people here, last names are actually a pretty new invention, from the last hundred years or so
The last name is usually a patronym of an older generation, often the first name of the person's grandparent
I find it very entertaining how vastly different American Anglo-Saxons' names are, compared to actual Brits
Like obviously you'd get some of the same "normal" names there but then there's names that just sound *super* American
They don't allow non-hyphenated but if you use a hyphen, it's technically one-word-not-two-or-more
It's more common for girls (Anna-Maria, Teodora-Luisa, etc) but it's gained momentum for boys, too (along the lines of Asparuh-Aleksandar, Vladimir-Asen
It's a bit odd for when foreigners get documents here because middle names don't exist here - we only have patronyms
So if someone gets a Bulgarian ID issued and their middle name is like, Claire or whatever, it just says "Father's name: Claire" and I think that's pretty funny
I get the same feeling when I hear "Slavic" names on American TV haha, it just feels wrong (cause it is wrong, in *our* languages and naming systems but not in English)
Kind of, yeah
I kind of thought Americans are likelier to do that, in addition to spelling some "conventional" names in more *kreatyve* ways (like the 10 thousand different ways to spell Katherine and it's variants)
Being a slave, probably
People think we speak Russian , the cyrillic alphabet is made in Russia or we are part of Russia
That's hilarious
You have come across some less educated fellow Bulgarians
It is not a common thing to assume that people eat dogs in Serbia
Tell me more about embarrassing moments
Last summer a 20-year old hacker has managed to attack our NRA register and get the data of around 5 million citizens only to show how poor the national cyber security systems are
[2019 Bulgaria revenue agency hack – Wikipedia]
Similar thing happened to our Commercial register this summer
Nothing more to add
A couple of years ago
I can tell you from experience that government agencies in Bulgaria use XP computers today
"Такова" in informal/slang/dialect language it has an infinite amount of meanings
It's mostly used when you forget the proper word for something
Apparently we're the vast minority here, but we don't. I remember we had something like that in kindergarten and maybe some classes in history where we've discussed some religion, but outside the very few religious schools - no, no religion classes in public schools
edit: I was reminded by other comments about the existence of the ethics classes, however this is taught in the same vein as philosophy, psychology etc
so it's not really religion-centered
Tell him Eastern Europe is a no go zone
Just go through some old Yurop vs Yank posts and pick whatever ludicrous claim any side beleived about the other
Tell him that virtually everything he hears is sarcasm/has the opposite meaning
Tell him that there is a somewhat new and only sometimes used common european language, just with heavy dialects (dutch is germanic, so I think that might be beleivable)
Everything has to be eaten by hand if doing so is even remotely possible (this is actually somewhat true for a fair few)
We are all *really* jealous of america and admire/worship it constanly
Everybody is liberal/progressive beyond imagination
You kiss instead of shaking hands, and have to bow to people who service you (cashiers to policemen)
AND MAKE SURE TO UPDATE US ON HOW IT GOES
Simpler way to put it is to tell him that there is a common european language, just with heavy dialects
Considering he'll just be in the netherlands and germany, that seems somewhat beleivable
I mean full-blown frenching any random stranger you would've otherwise shaken your hands with
Plovdiv
It’s far superior in every way - it’s more central than Sofia ended up to be after the wars
It’s already boasting better infrastructure and cultural life and it’s on a river
>It’s already boasting better infrastructure and cultural life
One must be careful about allowing wishful thinking to outweigh reality
>and it’s on a river
Which is non-navigable and whose main effect is to worsen the local climate - already worse than Sofia
>One must be careful about allowing wishful thinking to outweigh reality
The pedestrian infrastructure in the centre of the city is superior than anything Sofia can offer, Plovdiv is one of the few cities that has if not perfect, somewhat coherent cycling infrastructure etc
Good for the city administration to improve to pedestrian and cycling infrastructure, since with the decline of public transport, the Plovdiv citizens certainly need an alternative
Well someone has to be the black sheep, and we fit that role pretty well
Our geographic position is important for trade, though
Cheap labour and not so high taxes, but it is also a money pit
So I'm not sure
Our healthcare was partially privatised in the early 90s which made it far more expensive
Every citizen is covered for lots of things and state and municipal hospitals are affordable but they are expected to turn a profit which means they are critically underfunded and the quality of care is very weak
A typical fix for them is to rent out parts of their buildings to private clinics, so they can make some money
The state negotiates medicine prices and pays for them entirely for most chronic conditions, children and the elderly
The system has many problems and adopting many of the American “business first” concepts of healthcare was a stupid idea
We are a rapidly ageing nation, so we need serious reforms in our healthcare
A single payer NHS type a deal will be far superior in my mind, if we manage to reform the sector
The service nowadays is engulfed in corruption because if you pay the right person, your chances to receive higher quality treatment are higher
Those that can afford private hospitals have no issues - they only pay the difference between what they are entitled to via their state health coverage and what the hospitals bill you
The state is putting a price ceiling on most things tho, so there are no absurdly expensive procedures like in the US
But the lack of funding for highly specialised procedures usually means, people suffering from rare conditions have to go and receive treatment abroad - usually Germany or Israel
Dutch system (where I live now) sucks a big one
Even if you learned to read Cyrillic, it wouldn't make much difference if you didn't study the languages
All languages can be written in all alphabets, for example:
"Da uchish ezitsi e prekrasno i shte se radvam da nauchish moya ezik"
is a sentence in Bulgarian but written in Latin
It means "Studying languages is wonderful and I would be glad if you learned my language". It probably doesn't make any sense to you, even if you can read it, because it is written in Latin
SBCM and Bulgarian are about 60% mutually intelligible, so no that surprising
The Napoleonic wars
All I know is Napoleon was some army general from Corsica and that he somehow got in power, improved the army's logistical capabilities and used a lot of fucking canons
Took over most of Europe, was then defeated by a coalition and exiled
Somehow got back and did everything all over and after Waterloo was sent to some island in the Pacific and died
Excellent summary
Also that we built a shitload of commie blocks and basically made everyone equally f-ed (except the people connected to the regime, their families, their friends, also sometimes their other friends etc
Portugal cannot into Eastern Europe then
Classes are usually 40 minutes long, and there are 10 minute breaks in between
The "big" break is about 20 minutes for lunch
Our schools typically have shifts - half the school comes in at the morning, then the other half in the afternoon, and the following semester they switch
Shifts vary by school but they're roughly the same - mine did 7:30 am to 1:30 pm, and then 1:30 pm to 7:30 pm
This doesn't apply to private schools
**Grades 1 - 4:** classes start about 1 hour after other grades'. These kids get their "big" break after their second class, and they usually don't have more than 6 classes per day
I remember having at least one day that was 5 classes - it ended faster and it was delightful
There's also an optional "zanimalnya" which is basically a "study hall" you can sign your kid up for
It literally keeps them in school, doing homework and hobbies
It's very effective for  completely exhausting your child, making sure you don't have to help them study yourself, and keeping them in school while you're at work
You can pick up your child at any time, I think
**Grades 5 - 7:** the longest break is after the third class now, not the second
These kids are too old for that "study hall" option
Typically, 6 - 7 classes a day is the norm, and now they also have shifts
**Grades 8 - 12:** your longest break is still after the third class, and your classes are now usually 7 per day, 6 if the Gods are merciful
You have no time for anything
The 20 minute break is long enough to run at full speed to the nearest café and hope you can get a sandwich, shoving mouthfuls as you stride back in time for your next class
And because my school was *infuriating*, you were **not** allowed to leave early, ever
(*Very* rare exceptions
) Not if your last class was cancelled, not if a teacher was absent and no one could replace them
This is due to some liability, wherein if a student leaves within school hours and anything happens to them, the school can be blamed
So the most effective way of dealing with it they had, even when dealing with 19 year olds, was to find a teacher to keep them supervised
This lead to people being cooped up indoors with the teacher of a subject these students don't even *have* on the curriculum
Pretty similar in Bulgaria, but first shift starts at 7:30 am usually, so second shift is done by 7:30 pm, and thus they don't mix
Sorry, I didn't phrase that right
Today(24th) is Christmas eve,  tomorrow (25) is Christmas
Today (24th of Dec) is Badni vecher or Christmas Eve
Christmas is tomorrow
We celebrate both evenings
I don't know any Germans but even I would know immediately that he is German
Sunny Beach
It's a town by the seaside which is nothing special, but it's cheap and attracts a lot of tourists, mainly Russian
Don't be ridiculous
German is easy, especially for someone from a Germanic country
Try Russian, Bulgarian or Armenian, Arabic and see what the definition of hard is
*Deutsch ist einfach
Das sage ich aus eigener Erfahrung
I'd guess Hungarian
I'm a big fan of language and linguistics in general, but, man Hungarian is a treat
We actually had a game with a few of my friends guessing what an English word would sound like in Hungarian
We weren't very good at that game
From a different point, I guess any of the Slavic languages would be a nightmare
As a native Bulgarian speaker I can't imagine anyone having to learn all the rules that are basically just guidelines
Imagine I posted Joey meme
Ach, quatsch
Without the EU I never would’ve been able to do my bachelors and masters degrees in the the UK and have the life I’ve got now at all
So yeah, pretty damn glad
Hell yeah
Some of the fruits of the (most probable source) foreign political propaganda in Bulgaria:
EU is evil
It's bad to have child protection laws and agencies, because these agencies will kidnap your kids and will send them to the Netherlands to be adopted by gay couples
There were even protests by parents
Russia is good
Putin is strong
USA is evil - they have chemtrails and haarp and shit
Technically we were alies of the Germans so I feel by proxy I can relay the story of one relative of mine
He was telling stories of the royal days when he was sent to hunt communist partizans in the woods
When they reached some part of the woods his officer told him to stop, not make a sound and that they should go back immediately
Later that officer told him he said this and didn't continue further because he noticed they were completely surrounded and there was no point in dying for nothing
Later when the communists took over and we were buddying up with the Russians, this relative went together with 500000 of his country men to fight the nazis all the way to Vienna, though he was on a detachment that only reached as far as Hungary before the war was over
I don't remember many stories sadly, because he did mumble a lot and focused a lot on specific dry strategies instead of interesting adventures
He was incredibly lucky to have been caught in the west
There's some spooky stories coming out of those gulags but not many living people
Yeah and thank goodness that Bulgaria refused to send troops to Russia due to them having freed us one generation before
Given what happened to Romanians and Italians on the Eastern front I don't think he would have survived
It's relatively good
I don't really use it but if I'm searching for a something related to Bulgaria I prefer using the Bulgarian version
Here it is normal to drink tap water, but in some cites/towns people dontdrink it because of the bad flavour/bad source
Depends on where you live i guess
Friends and family from the "outskirts" of the city drink bottled / filtrated water
I live in the center of Sofia so i drink tap water and its okay i guess, bottles would be a waste
Every time I've seen Germans and Austrians buy bottled water here, they always looked for carbonated water
One said it was because sparkling water tasted fresh and still water felt stale
Is there any other reason to it
Bulgarians usually buy still water when thirsty and drinking tap water is very common
Really
I’ve never drunk tap water in my life, actually, if we’re out of bottled, I would rather not drink even if I’m thirsty, than drink the disgusting tap water
Well I don't know where you are from, but where I am all people drink tap water it's much better than bottled one
Varna, currently living in Sofia
Never heard of anyone drinking tap water (maybe some after it’s filtrated)
I drink Sofia tap water, Varna (and everywhere near the sea) water is disgusting . All my friends drink Sofia water
In NL (the Netherlands) where I am they're setting phonetowers on fire because they're brainwashed on Facebook to believe 5G causes people to die which the government then covers up with a hoax about corona or some dumb shit like that
Either way they're setting these phonetowers on fire, which is funny because there is no 5g in the Netherlands yet
Lol
Bulgaria
Extreme poverty between the pensioners - the are lacking basic products such as yoghurt, milk and bread
After they pay utilities, many have enough money only for a slice or two of bread per week and that's it
Meat is a lux that most of them can't afford
Medicine also
Warsawo walcz
Or something
A lot of foreigners make the mistake of comparing it to Russian because of the alphabet
Big mistake
The structure and lexical complexities are very different, trying to aproach it as if they shared more than a *some* words is a sure way to learn *nothing*.
Biggest tip
Actually put **effort** into it
A lot of people get discouraged very quickly when they come here, and they just get by, usually with English or Russian
But I've seen foreigners (Austrian and Scottish, specifically) absolutely killing it, to the point I couldn't even guess they weren't native speakers
Not being afraid to fuck up and asking for help when you need it is a sure way to get better at it
All nouns have genders, all others' words genders are based on the given nouns
Verbs are fucked up, just learn the three basic tenses
Edit: this is Bulgarian, forgot to mention
Don't you guys have a thing where you just flip a word and it becomes something completely different
The weird thing is also that the letter 'c' doesn't have a unique sound to begin with
It's either pronounced as k or s.
My mom knows french and has tried to explain it me
Still can't wrap my head around it
The four freedoms of the EU are the closest that we come to a unified identity
Many children grow with the knowledge they are just as much EU citizens as they are citizens of their country
This is what a growing identity is about
We do not necessarily have a whole lot in common now,  however I believe that EU-powered developments (border opening, encouraged trans-state migration and potential mixed marriages, joint multinational ventures etc
) are already binding Europeans closer than ever and the trend is an upward one, so just give it time
We live in Europe
A functioning union that holds us accountable to certain standards
Great
A European *state*? Fuck that
>we pretty much gave up our national pride
>we as Germans are already [...] far ahead then others
Hmm
Bulgarians are not yet in the Eurozone, so we still have the hassle of currency exchange when going to Greece, but the freedom to just board a plane with nothing but your ID is something that was so alien to me prior to 2007 when we joined
My niece for example, doesn't really grasp the concept of a Bulgarian citizen, denied access to a Western European country
She doesn't remember Bulgaria prior to the EU, so for her, her Bulgarian citizenship is a one that opens Europe to her
She was born in 2003
Every young person, I've talked to, that were too little to remember life before 2007 consider other EU nationals as foreigners, but they are not as foreign as someone from outside the EU
This is what I meant by "growing identity".
Italians just refuse to believe the idea of this imaginary continent named Europe
What is even Europe
Go sell your lies to someone who is too naive to fall for it
When you forget to close the door: You are not walking through curtains
When you want to eat but your mom is in a hurry/has something else to do/can't give you anything: You ate my ears
Almost everytime
My language has a very phonetic up-to-date spelling system and everything is written almost as it sounds
Same in Bulgaria
We sometimes call it "The white house" because a lot of bathrooms used to be white in past
There are various folk songs (some of dubious authenticity) detailing different freedom fighters against the Ottomans, going all the way back to the last Tzar before the medieval kingdom was conquered
Long story short, "Turks bad".
Just New Year's Eve
For the other events we have some military parades
There is one that is marked by sounding all the emergency sirens in the country for two minutes at noon on the 2nd of June
Alright
This isn't exactly ridiculous, rather weird:
Khan Krum made a cup out of the skull of the emperor of Byzantium, who lost to him
When the Russians took Dobruja from US and gave it to the Romanians in exchange for Bessarabia
One of our king dynasties ended via castration
At one point of Russian history we asked vikings to come and rule us because even though our land is enourmous it is  completely orderless
Can we do it again please
Most can't explain what the white in our flag means
Most people know for sure that the green means nature, red means blood that has been spilled in wars, but when it comes to white most people are like
Some say it refers to freedom or peace, most just say they don't know
Many people know about how the Danes stood up for their Jews during the Holocaust but so did the Bulgarians
In fact, even though Bulgaria was aligned with the Axis powers during WWII, most of their Jewish population survived the war
To put it in layman’s terms, this was done by procrastination
Axis-allied countries were told to round up their Jews and get them ready to deport for concentration camps but members of the Bulgarian community and the Bulgarian Orthodox Church protested these orders and convinced the Tsar to delay the deportations indefinitely
The Jews in Bulgaria had a pretty bad time during the war (forced labor for men, property confiscations) but almost all of them avoided deportation and survived
Yes
Hissarya Bulgaria
The old city is surrounded by a massive fortification from the Romans
Fucking everywhere
It's actually a huge pain in the ass for builders in my city - if you want to build anything in the city center there's a big possibility that you'll dig up some roman ruins and it'll delay construction time for a couple of years
Here in Bulgaria we have a lot of them [wiki] . Even in my small town there is one of the few intakt roman bathouses [link] .
A ridiculous amount
We have whole ruin cities and everything, it's insane
Many towns here have Roman ruins, to a varying degree of preservation - many are exactly ruins, but there are also some very preserved ones
Most major cities have well preserved ruins, because they were major hubs in the past too - some started by the Romans, others continued from Thracian, Greek or even more ancient settlements
Most concentrated ruins you'll probably find in Plovdiv- [ancient Philipopolis] \- they've got Roman Theatre, Forum, Stadium, Basilica, parts of Aqueduct, villas, and other bits of pieces around town
In recent years the capital Sofia excavated and put to show in the centre its old crossroads of [Ulpia Serdica] they also have 4th century Rotunda, and some other pieces of the old town on show now
In Varna we have remains of some pretty [huge Roman Baths] (7,000 m2 - claimed to befourh largest preserved in Europe)
They might have been a bit of overreach or the town hit some rough times, because there are much smaller later thermae built near them - I guess the big ones had too much upkeep and were left without maintenance
There are also some other known ruins burried under the city (city wall, temple, etc
) but these are still left to be exhibited properly
Speaking of baths - Hisarya had pretty big ones too having mineral hotsprings -  [
And there are a lot of other Roman ruins around towns, military encampments, villas ([1] [2] two major Roman roads passed through Bulgaria and there are remains of them too - Via Militaris/Diagonalis, Via Pontica
There's also [Nicopolis ad Istrum] which has this cool tidbit about it:
> Nicopolis ad Istrum can be said to have been the birthplace of [Germanic] literary tradition
In the 4th century, the [Gothic] bishop, missionary and translator [Ulfilas] (Wulfila) obtained permission from Emperor [Constantius II] to immigrate with his flock of converts to Moesia and settle near Nicopolis ad Istrum in 347-8
[\[21\]] There, he devised the [Gothic alphabet] and oversaw the translation of the [Bible] from [Greek] to [Gothic] which was performed by a group of scholars
[\[22\]]
[The Red Church near Perushtitsa] \- of late Roman, early Byzantine origin
And many many more, I could go on for ages - all worth seeing or at least taking up the ruins and daydreaming how much more important and busy these places were in Antiquity
Lol, where are you - Varna, Plovdiv, Sofia
Although basically every big city here had a Roman settlement once, though some are even much older than that
[Azis - Sen Trope] I'm ashamed to admit that I find it catchy
It's a bad song which I despise, as well as the artist, but god damn I can't help myself but listen to it when I'm bored, it's unironically catchy
I guess that's what happens when your friends jokingly introduce you to such music and then listen to it nonstop with you ""for the lols"" huh
We have more beautiful women than most of the world
I haven’t had this case but an acquaintance of mine said he had an online friend for a few months or years and the two didn’t know the other was Bulgarian till they were playing a game and after a loss my acquaintance cursed in Bulgarian
Years is probably a bit of an exaggeration
We’re talking like 1 or 2 years tops
Packages here must be delivered and signed off
If there's no one at the address, most delivery companies just return the package at the warehouse, give the client a call and arange either a new address or new delivery date
Most people have their stuff delivered to a delivery company branch office near their home and pick their stuff from there
Your "ı" makes the same sound as the letter "ъ" in Bulgarian, which isn't present in English
Also, if I'm not mistaken, that's similar to â and ă in Romanian but don't quote me on that
Most things in the service industry, from food to movie tickets
Everything
Reading all the comments from neighbouring countries makes me feel as if i live elsewhere
I can no longer be sure whether our salaries are absurdly low or food prices are abnormally high+not the same quality, lol
Same
I personally haven't been to Romania so i decided to check salaries
The data that shows up is from July 2019
Minimum salary in Romania is 446
02€ per month versus 286
33€ per month for Bulgaria
I don't know products prices in Romania but looking at ours we get worse quality but expensive foods here
And prices are only going up
As for living standards I'd say that the average Bulgarian lives poorly and i don't even want to get to the point with pensioners
The funniest part is how things are with the covid-19 panic going on rn
We ran out of basic stuff in the matter of days and doctors decide to quit their jobs because of bad working conditions (we have under 10 proven cases of infected)
As i said i haven't been to Romania but from what i see here, I'd assume that Bulgaria and Romania don't have the same living standards
Hell yeah I do
I love rain in general tbh
Salmon snake is an amazing word to have
Здравей, казвам\* се\*\* Джон, удоволствие е да се\*\* запознаем. Откъде си?
Hello, say myself John, pleasure is to ourselves meet
From where are you
\*казвам = say, but казвам се = I am called
If I translate each word individually, as is OP's idea, казвам would be just say
\*\*these are untranslatable in English, they don't have short forms of reflexive pronouns
Best guess is myself and ourselves
Many other languages have such forms so an example would be **mi** chiamo and **ci** conosciamo in Italian
Здравей, казвам се Джон. Приятно ми е да се запознаем! Откъде идваш?
Hello, I say John
Nice me to met
From where you come
I didn't serve in the military but I was apprehended by military security in the baracks next to my grandmother's for sneaking in and picking plums off one of the trees
I was in 6th grade :D
My dad has a lot of those
One guy he went to basic training with was a chess wizard, and he could beat anyone with his back turned
(They'd tell him where they moved a piece, and he'd tell them where to move one right back, etc
Never lost
) But their drill srgt (or commanding officer, not sure which exactly in our case) took the guy's set eventually
Another time he was in Baghdad and somebody was telling a pretty unbelievable family story relating to his grandfather
that sounded familiar
He got into an argument with the guy
Turned out they're cousins that met hundreds of miles away, for the first time in their lives
His stories about scorpions fucking *everywhere* have inspired me to check my shoes for arachnids before I put them on to this day
Most of the soldiers inside were 18-20 year olds in for their mandatory military service - it was still a thing
The
I don't know how it's called in English - the director, laughed his ass off when I was brought up to him by the security soldiers
He said: "I've been spending too much time worrying how to keep these idiots in (the soldiers), that I didn't think someone would come from outside". I was just escorted to the gate and I went home but he did make me leave the plums tho
Dude, the story is actually **so** crazy I'm planning on writing about it in detail some day
So their grandfather had a long lost baby brother - the father gave the baby away when the mother died, and it was just impossible for him to take care of all the kids + a baby that needs nursing
He told the siblings the baby died, too
Fast forward some years, the kid finds out he's adopted and finds his biological family - very happy he has siblings now
Some time after he gets engaged and he's about to be married
and his bride bails on him
Literally, runaway bride, in the wedding dress, a few hours before the service
He's crushed
Maybe 50-ish years later, this guy is old and widowed, at a mineral bath for back pain relief and relaxation
And he runs into the same runaway bride - now old and widowed herself - who left him at the altar decades ago
*And they get married
And this is the story that my dad overhears, calls out the other guy on how impossible that is because that's *his* grandfather, what are the odds of the same thing happening to someone else
And they turn out to be cousins lol
Yeah
That base was converted into a museum few years later when the mandatory service was discontinued
By the way - this is [said gate] It lists the names of those of the 29th Infantry Regiment who died in WWI and the Balkan wars
Yeah
I am not in the tree-climbing phase of my life anymore :D
I see some generalisations and they come close, but the only answer that could be 100% fair to the question is: it is different for every country
In every constitution or other parts of the legislature the power and the responsibilities of those figures are determined
For example Emmanuel Macron in the role of a president is way more powerful than the Bulgarian president
In presidential republics such as the USA, France and Russia the president is one of the most powerful people in the state in terms of powers and he is a representative/head of of the government
In Bulgaria, the president is not attached to it - the president is a separate institution and the head of the government is the prime minister
So, depending on whether it is a presidential or a parliamentary form of state, it is the either the president or the prime minister who is the wielder of the executive power, which he exercises with the ministers
If you want to know what the difference is in terms of powers and responsibilities, you need to look up the constitution or some summary of it and you will get an idea
There are no schoolbook definitions to state the differences since it changes from country to country
Source: have studied international relations and have had classes on division of power, state structure and functions and e.t.c.
Not really
On 9^(th) of May we are preoccupied with arguments pro and con the Victory Parade in Moscow
I have never heard this my entire life, if anything some people do acknowledge that it is EU day, but barely
Idk about the German flag but when I was in Nurnberg I saw many houses flying the FC Nurnberg flag (the football team) and also some flying the Bavarian flag
Found it really strange how some people are such big fans of their club
Basically the country is split by russophiles and russophobes
Russophiles celebrate it as Victory day, some of them go and put flowers on old Soviet-era monuments
Russophobes don't celebrate it at all
I have never seen anybody celebrating it as Europe day
We weren't really a dictatorship until 1934 when Zveno couped the government
Still back then we were chasing our national reunification with Dobruja and Macedonia
Our economy was the strongest in the Balkans (tho heavily tied to Germany)
At first we were neutral but then we had no chance, we had to join the Axis or we would have been invaded
Yeah, kinda
At the end of the war we had more territory
We weren't occupied like the serbs or the greeks
The only downside is that we got bombed by the americans
Our soldiers weren't on the Eastern front
So yeah, it went pretty good compared to the rest of Europe
Mission London (Мисия Лондон) for Bulgaria
Letter to America (2000)
Not really sure, don't know any good Bulgarian movies
Bulgarian has a certain lexical and grammatical richness to it that I can't get enough of, not to mention our colloquialisms and proverbs
Names, by extension, are very versatile - you can have *Ivan*, the default name
If you're yelling at him, he becomes *Ivané*, if you're talking about him, he can become *Vankata* ("the Vanka", Vanka is a common nickname/diminutive for Ivan)
In English (and most other languages I'm familiar with) *John* is always *John*, only sometimes *Johnny*, no matter if I'm talking to him or about him, and the sentence or grammar never requires that to change
In Bulgarian, the need for this change isn't really a need, grammatically, but it's leftover from an earlier stage of the language and it's pretty much mandatory speech - it just sounds better if you do it, than if you don't. (I'm sure this is subjective but you can just tell when something sounds *right*, you know
Our own cultural context is *very* rich
You can translate some words like "voevoda" to "chieftain" but you do lose something along the way of translation
This way I have friends who are funny in English, but they're fucking *hilarious* in Bulgarian
For example: my friend was retelling a conversation with their grandmother, and the punchline was that their grandmother was asking them  something, and the final answer was "I don't throw beans
" That doesn't really make sense, does it
Now if I give you the context that throwing beans is a method of fortune telling/reading the future, it *still* doesn't sound too funny
The particular way the words were put together goes a long way, too
We mostly don't use the "I" part of "I'm". For example, if someone were to ask me "What are you doing", they'd mostly phrase it as (literal translation) "What are doing", but with a different form of "doing" so that I know it's related to me
Правя - I am doing
Правиш - you are doing
Прави - he/she/it is doing
Правим - we are doing
Правите - you (plural) are doing
Правят - they (plural) are doing
It has some odd things that just don't make sence in other languages
For example: Искаш ли да ядеш шамари?
Which is translated "Do you want to eat slaps"
The meaning is something like:"If you don't do -insert something here- I'm going to slap you"
There are lots of other things that make 0 sence in english, but you will probably get bored if I write them
Also, it can sound hard and soft at the same time and I find it cool
English is soo good for music and has the highest information density
The information per syllable is extremely high making the language very efficient at expressing ideas
None
Bulgarian cuisine is a collection of only exquisite top notch meals
Examples being кебапчета with лютеница and шкембе чорба among many others
"Shkembe chorba" is tripe soup - local classic
Was told by a foreign ex that they only use tripe to feed it to their dog there
Also, a beverage called "boza". Foreigners hate it, we drink it since childhood here and it's pretty well-liked
It's made from fermented grains and some sugar
Dude, that sounds delicious
You can't say that when the full English breakfast exists mate
English food is actually pretty good, even if a bit simple at times
Tripe soup is magical but the smell is what *really* cures the hangover
Окей has been integrated in Bulgarian vernacular for decades
As in other cases, the adjective means "good" rather than "meh".
Pretty common, even though we have a couple of substitutes
I would say, we're still free so just take it from me that everything is A-ok, don't check for yourself and please go back to your timeline now
Did Macedonia even exist in 1919
Malta, Hungary and Lithuania
Hungary is such a fascinating nation to me
Lots of interesting history, the language omg is just brilliant and the origins of the Hungarians
All of these topics are very interesting and I feel like it's an overlooked nation
Also I know it sounds bias but Bulgaria too
This probably a bit of illogical and unpopular opinion, but I approach this from another angle
Yes, it is sad that a building with so much history, having endured a lot and inspired so many people is burning down, but think about it
If another big church or mosque or some other cultural/religious building, that has not been so popular from literature or from being promoted as a cultural spot burns down, there probably won't be such a big outcry, if it was let's say in Africa
Thus, I'd say, if it wasn't popular then it wouldn't have been maintained that much or at all if it was at some godforsaken place where the society is poor or doesn't give a damn about culture
So we should have been happy that we got to experience/know/see it despite it being 8 centuries old, because nothing is made to last forever
The sad thing is that this building got to lose most of its original self so abruptly
yes this is very sad moment in europe and world cultural history
I have been to the one in Reims and it is a great place I recommend it as well
This is the church where a big chunk of France's kings were crowned throughout its history
We kind of stare, I've had foreign friends point it out as a bit weird
It's not even necessarily with any negative connotations or snooping, I guess we just kind of do it more often or more visible than other peoples
As a Bulgarian what you describe sounds extremely familiar, lol
Everyone hate Sofia too
This is the first time a government is set to finish its term since 2009, so yeah - we have had three interim governments appointed by the President since I started voting
It's pretty much expected for anyone under 30 to speak some level of English, and anybody over 50 to speak at least *some* Russian
We have a very high emigration rate, so the majority of young people are fluent in English *and* one more foreign language - most commonly German
This isn't reflective of the whole country but at least in my part of it, and in my social circles, it's a prevaling theme
I'm actually very surprised when somebody I meet (around my age) doesn't know any English, and I've had friends express similar disbelief when people they work or study with are unfamiliar with it
Most people speak 2 languages
Its seen as normal
Younger people speak English and older people speak Russian
It is a must here in Bulgaria
Every student studies at least one foreign language and I would say a huge portion of the median students have some knowledge in another
Most of our parents and grand parents have had to study Russian at school and some speak either German (because of East Germany) or French (France has always endorsed smart people and culture and some people during socialist times could use this to migrate there)
Nowadays English, German, French and Spanish are the most popular second and third language
I would say that Italian also holds popular along with Russian for some parts of the students
People here are really keen on learning foreign languages due to opportunities for work, but I'd like to think it is also because of genuine interest
It is uncommon, but not exactly rare to find people who have studied Polish, Czech or Hungarian as well as Scandinavian languages
I personally have studied English since I was 6, Russian for 3 years in school and German in highschool
In my second year in university I started learning Swedish and want to learn it up to at least B2, hopefully C1 level
Edit: some grammar and wording
That is exactly the reason why so few people are fluent or at least conversational in English
Their language's vocabulary and grammar are both very different from any Indo-European language so practically any foreign language will be hard to learn
Compare that to the Scandinavian languages, which are extremely close to English and it's really not a surprise why Hungarians are having a harder time with the language
Oh yes definitely
Just the sheer fact that their languages has 18 CASES is enough to drive crazy any foreigner, foolish enough to try and learn the language
I havent heard of such a rule, altough in some houses not taking your shoes off is disrespectful
Depending on the context
I'd expect my closest friends to act as if they are at their own homes, so if they open the fridge when we are at my place to eat or have drinks - no
But gursts who aren't really my closest friends won't even consider going anywhere near my fridge, nor I - theirs
Literally all our neighbours have fantastic nature, delicious traditional cuisine, and are very hearty people
Turkish people are very helpful, in my experience
Macedonians sound a funny to us and they're very boisterous
Serbians have amazing barbecue and alcohol
Romania has pretty good post-communist infrastructure
Greece is
there
I've never been but it's where everybody I know goes to the beach, because it's better than ours
They're cool, too
**Turkey** - I love how polite they are
Turkish people, at least from the regions I have been in, are very cordial and nice
It's definitely a deep cultural thing, as I do know that the literary Turkish language has "politeness" gramatically ingrained in it, and people seem to really adhere to that
**Romania** - They seem to be a lot more outgoing than us, with cultural events, parties etc
**Serbia** - Food's delicious
Sausages, cevapi and burek are all superior to our versions there
**Macedonia** - I love how in touch they are with the ancient Hellenic roots of the South Slavs
It is truly amazing how despite having basically a complete cultural overlap with Bulgaria, Macedonia has somehow preserved an ancient connection to Alexander the Great, which was nonexistent for hundreds of years, and suddenly resurrected in the last few decades
Amazing
**Greece** - I love the culture of family and unity
Greeks seem a lot better than us at knowing their extended family, keeping in touch and an overall strong sense of community
I have endless admiration for this and wish we were closer to this
Putin, of course
Without him, I could probably return to Russia and not be afraid for my kids anymore (queer family)
Ivan Geshev
He's our chief prosecutor and reports to no one while all other prosecutors report to him so he has unlimited power over who gets prosecuted
He is a complete failure but got the position because of how broken the system is
I meant that me (woman) is married to another woman but we both  are bi so I don't like to call us lesbian couple
Well now I live in country that isn't pro-LGBT either, but just "nobody is actively trying to take you kids away" is already couple of light years better than what we had in Russia
It wasn't always the case and it change quite fast
12 years ago, lots of Moscow fertility clinics websites had pages for their lesbian clients
Then, anti-gay propaganda law passed and everything changed
I'm pretty sure that without intensive goverment propaganda feeding it everything will come back to neuturality
Plus, gen z in Russia isn't that different from european/american gen z and straight millenials are also changing for better
For example, when government made [this  hilariously bad anti-gay video] couple of weeks ago  most comments were very supportive and disguisted by people who made this video
Different standarts I guess
I'm also millenial but I can live rude words from some people (though surprisingly I never heard any IRL in any country), it's systemic oppresion by government that makes things unbearable
There is a clerk at the baby registry who is the ultimate decider
The parents can appeal to the court, but the basic rules are:
* the name must be a real human name from any culture - it can be a Bulgarian traditional name, Slavic, British, German, Muslim etc
* the name must not be offensive to the child - it can’t be Asshole Petrov or something like that
* the name must not be offensive to the Bulgarian nation or state - it can’t be Bulgarochtonos etc
* the name can’t be spelled in weird ways - it can’t contain numbers, weird letter clusters etc
* the name can be transliterated into Latin (for international documents) only under the rules of the Transliteration Act - the name Миролюба can only be spelled Mirolyuba in Latin
* if the parents can’t or won’t agree on a name by the third day after the birth, the clerk will choose the baby’s name for them and their choice can’t be appealed
It's very appreciated if a foreigner have learned something,  we love when someone have put a bit of effort to learn our very unpopular language
You can almost always hear the difference when a foreigner is speaking Bulgarian for just a few days, so when somebody says to me "Hello, good morning" or whatever in Bulgarian I always say "nice
" in English and from there we either continue speaking English or hand language if they don't know it
I usually don't have a problem if they insist on speaking Bulgarian but sometimes foreigners pronounce words in such a funny way that there's always a smile on my face
I'd definitely say roses
We are pretty proud with our rose industry here in Bulgaria
Roses, cigarettes, rakia, kebapcheta/kufteta
In that order
Roses with a hint of дюнерче.
My home town decreased with about 20 000 people in the past 15-20 years
Once people finish high school they move to Sofia and the other 2-3 big cities in Bulgaria or abroad for university/ work
It’s not that noticeable because the town is still rather big (for BG standards at least) but I don’t wanna imagine what the situation feels like in smaller towns (<50k or less)
Well, Bulgaria has the fastest shrinking population on Earth
Currently, nobody is doing anything about this, except maybe giving people from North Macedonia and Bessarabia citizenship because their great-grandparents and grandparents were Bulgarians, but those people immediately move to Western Europe, because they can't as Macedonians or Ukrainians
There have been some policies aimed at bringing Bulgarian diaspora back in the country, but with little success
Bulgarians will start coming back maybe in 15-20 years when the country is more advanced and the wages are similar to Central Europe now
But I fear nothing less than some government law like "have at least two children by 40 years old", basically the opposite of the Chinese one child policy, is going to fix this
By the way, I kinda have a prediction that in about a decade or two, poorer people from Western Europe will start to move en masse to Eastern Europe, because the wages here will be closer to those in Western Europe, but the prices of real estate, for example, will be a lot lower, especially because of the mass exodus (demand is low, therefore prices are also low)
English will be a lot more prevalent, so the language barrier will also shrink
This has already started for older people
For example, there's a good number of Germans in Bulgaria who are over 65 and live here comfortably with their pensions, while they would struggle in Germany
This is going to become a trend in the coming years
My whole country's population is decreasing rappidly
Literally whole towns get abandoned and deleted off the map, which leaves tons of abandoned houses and facilities
Its very scary but most people dont care, which i find very dumb
I hope economic growth brings people back to the country
I'm from the biggest city, so my experience with it isn't as 'severe'.
People from all over the country move here for university and work, or they go abroad
Sometimes both - as a result, I have friends and family all over the world
There's plenty of near empty or abandoned villages, and smaller cities/towns keep getting emptier
We do get people, in small numbers, who move here from abroad
Retired elderly, English, American or otherwise, who just want a calm lifestyle
Also students from other countries because our universities are cheaper
It's mostly sad but also, life goes on
I'd love for it to be vibrant and the population evenly distributed but we don't have much going on around the villages and that's that
One of the cities I lived in
Decreased for 20 years with around 20k to 30k people
Bulgaria has the fastest shrinking population:
From almost 9 000 000 in 1989 to <7 000 000 today
There are hundreds of abandoned villages
The fall of communism and the following years of BS surely contributed to it but I think we were gonna drop in population regardless
See, during the ‘30s, ‘40s, ‘50s etc Bulgaria drastically went from a super rural country to a very urbanised one
People massively moved from the villages to the cities
So what does this mean
Well, when people used to live in the villages they had farms and big houses therefore it was also normal for each family to have 5-6 children sometimes more
Once everyone moved to the cities people’s lifestyle changed and they now had 1-2 children max
I’m not saying emigration after ‘89 is not an important factor but there’s more to the population decline for sure
Forgot to mention: during the first half of 20
Century, Bulgaria also received a major population boost by Bulgarian refugees coming from every single neighbouring country
It’s tough
Part of me has considered moving back
For a host of reasons
I’m currently working and going on to train I a high demand field worldwide
I also am fairly burnt from the West
Also the increasing costs of living despite working a good job with a good salary is becoming absurd
Though I’d be burnt out from Bulgaria in different ways
Yes absolutely
If alcohol cigarettes and caffeine are legal, so should weed
Take the market away from the criminals who are currently selling it and put that tax money in the EU coffers for public use
Legalized but regulated
It's currently criminalised here which leads to teenagers and young people having their lives destroyed by like a gram, because police are more concerned with a 17 year old trying to unwind than actual harmful things going on
Furthermore, we are one of the countries with the highest amounts of cigarette consumption in the entire world
Children as early as 12 years old are smokers, and this is not being regulated at all, or even addressed
The fear-mongering around 'drugs' completely ignores how normalized alcoholism and smoking, two extremely accessable bad habits, are
Marijuana has actual medical properties, and incorporating it at least for medicinal usage would only benefit us
It's not a universally good thing, it can be bad for some people, but it is without a doubt a million times better and more beneficial than the 'drugs' we are consuming constantly anyway
Absolutely
Marijuana has medicial properties as well, and cigarettes are far worse, yet they are perfectly legal and widespread, despite their proven correlation to cancer
And marijuana addiction is closer to an internet addiction than a hard drug addiction, in terms of severity
It's entirely possible to develop one but it depends more on the person because the substance isn't inherently addictive
When I was a kid and had never been abroad I imagined EVERY foreign country looked like Manhattan or downtown LA because my only exposure to the outside world was TV
TBH you can easily lump the balkan, world, spanish and russian civil wars into one big 50 year-long conflict, and future history lessons will almost certainly do so
Why 05 and not 00005
A man of culture
Finally
I once had diner with my friend at 3:30pm
I was staying with him
This was a totally normal thing
I felt as if I'd accidentally agreed to go on a 16 hour fast
In the village where our villa used to be, there is this place called *Chumavi mogili* (Plague's mounds), where during the Plague people would take their family members that were sick with the Plague and leave them there
At the base of the hill where the place is, there is this *cheshma* (water fountain, looking like something like [this] where no healthy person would drink from, but they would go there at sunset to leave baskets with food for their sick loved ones for the next day
When we were little we used to go there on the cheshma and we would tell stories about ghosts and we were sure there were *chumavi* (sick with the Plague) ghosts, that still came to this place at sunset to look for their loved ones
Other creepy place is the village Shishentsi, where people don't dare to go out after dark, because they often hear incorporeal screams and drums, which some old people claim are *talasamsko horishte* (a demon's ball)
A friend from the region once said that the village is cursed for not having any living [kukeri] in it to chase the demons away
God's eyes cave or [Prohodna cave] is spooky as well, especially during full moon
Also:
* the [vampire grave] in Sozopol - a grave of a 35 years old man, who was buried with a metal rod pinning him to the ground through the heart;
* the [Devil's bridge] in Ardino - according to legends, no one could build a bridge over the rushing river but a young builder accepted thr task
One day the Devil himself appeared and told the builder than the only way for a bridge to stand over this spot is to build the Devil's face in the bridge, but the face must be visible and invisible at the same time
So the builder made the bridge to shape the face of the Devil only during [high sun]
* the [darvobrad tree] (named after the ents from LOTR)
This tree is shaped like a man;
* [Sveta Nedelya Church] in Batak - the place where hundreds of Bulgarians were slaughtered by the Ottoman army in 1876's Bataka massacre
The church today displays some of the remains of the now canonised as saint-marters inhabitants of Batak;
* [The Devil on the Zhivkovtsi's Church] \- in the 1970s the Communist party evicted the people of the village of Zhivkovtsi because it was due to be submerged by the new Osogovo dam
For decades the village was under water but recently the water receded and the only piece of art in the Church that survived was an image of the Devil
I see his face in the stone under the bridge - I think that's his face
Some think the arches of the bridge are the hornes and the eyes and the yelow rocks the the nose (or beak)
Yeah
I just remembered another one
This American girl made a video for it:
There are many stories of samodivas attacking people in the 70s and the 80s. The video distorts the legend a little - the men taken by the samodivas are not tortured to death, but they forget to eat or sleep so they die of exhaustion
A newer esoteric urban legend is the one for the [Tsarichina dupka] (The hole in Tsarichina)
In the early 90s the Army started excavations in the centre of Tsarichina village and the official reason was that they thought there is a burried treasure left by Tsar Samuil
According to some UFO-chasers, they were digging to find some mystical or alien artefact
They even took [baba Vanga] to the hole so she can examine it, and after she did, she warned them that there is something very old and very dangerous in there and she begged them not to open it
They didn't listen and continued еxcavations
Some claim they found an alien powersource, explaining the beams of light, that at some point came out of the hole, some claim they found the tomb of the egyptian godess Bast
After two years of secret digging, the army suddenly canceled the project and poured tonnes of concrete in the hole to seal it and the plot of land where the hole is, is now government property
Yes
That's how I see it
No - the stone is part of the bedrock
Some other legends claim he placed his wife's soul in the foundation of the bridge as sacrifice to the Devil, so the beridge can stand
С - with
But it's pronounced sus
Я - pronounced ja
It can mean her in bulgarian
We are the only slavs in the world that don't use я for "I" or "me"
И - and, pronounced as E
А - whereas
У - around, like u nego (у него) means he has it but it literally means around him
А, е, и, в and у are all words in Bulgarian
Most of then don't have a primary role, but actually help bind sentences, add stuff when stating things or show the position of someone/something
Edit: forgot one word/letter
same
Forgot в - means "in" and is pronounced vuv
I don’t think it’s rude - talking about income allows people to measure one another
At my job when appraisals come round all we talk about is the salaries we (want to) get
Not talking about it can only help an employer to hire people on different wages for same or similar positions
I don't mind sharing if there is a valid reason - for example someone is looking for a similar job to mine and asks me what he should negotiate for
I would never bring it up if not asked
I have had quite a few people ask me how much I make out of the blue and my answer depends on how close they are
Overall, I don't think it's taboo but I wouldn't share my income to people who didn't ask, and might refuse to answer to people who asked if I decide it might create problems or tension
I am in IT: we don’t have a union
Interesting, and do the people, whose salaries you ask about in the tax office, get notified about it
Are black or green olives more popular in your country
In Bulgaria black olives are a standard
Way more popular compared to green olives
People usually associate green olives with Greece
Which ones are more popular in your countries and are consider more 'standard' compared to the other ones
Nahh, I prefer black ones
Greens have a very strong taste, I can eat just one green olive a year, like a shot
Black ones I can eat them as a snack, very mild and pleasant taste
They wut
They color green olives to make them look black
Wtf, the taste will still be the same
What a scam lol
You have fish stuffed olives there ??
These look like pointy nipples
I feel weird about them, I'll pass
I've never heard something like that, interesting
Also the texture will be the same
In Bulgaria the black ones are very cheap, so there is no need to do all these shenanigans
Probably because it is super easy and common to import them, since Greece is right next to our butt
Interesting
I have never even imagined fish stuffed olives
Now I must find and try some
I was always curious, are the Swedish speakers in Finland regular Finns who just happen to speak Swedish as a native language due to history (Finland being part of Sweden for a very long time, similarly to most Irish people speaking English nowadays) or actual Swedish people whose ancestors moved to Finland and they managed to preserve their language
Ukraine was never really a bilingual country, at least in the sense that is meant in this thread
In fact, for the size of its minority language speakers it had easily the worst language laws in Europe
So I don't see on what exactly you're basing your claims
The experience of people living in actual bilingual countries is completely at odds with your opinion
> Russian is vastly more dominant and preferred,
There is also the factor that this was the situation before he came to power and would be under any regime that actually took the opinion of the people into account
After all, in most normal countries the dominant and preferred language language is the majority language
When I was a kid literally everyone used to walk to and back from school, usually in small groups of 4-5 kids who all lived in the same neighbourhood or area of the city
Kids who lived outside the city always took the bus together
Parents would only come to pick you up on rare instances like if there was a huge storm outside or something
I don’t really know if it’s still like this though
Yeah
I was going to school alone ever since 2nd grade
I have heard a lot of people to pronounce (3) three as free, so in the shop for example you here free ot this, free of that ets
In Bulgarian, "Fitness" is used to refer to a gym or a fitness centre
So it's not uncommon for people to say "I go to the fitness"
Lol in the early stages Bulgarians mess up the other way around and will call a chair "he" or a table "she" and so on
I'm completely fluent in English and have no accent anymore but words like jeweler and jewelry *still* give me a hard time
I have to actually think about how to say them every time and I have to push my brain to do it lol
You should try saying "the rural juror". That one is a trip even for native speakers
Some Bulgarians sound like babies too but for a different reason - they pronounce a lot of Ls as W. They can say the L sound in Listen but not in "flowing". So they literally say things like "hewwo" and "fwowing" and "wike" (like)
Another section of Bulgarians can't pronounce w at ALL, so it gets replaced with u. So it's uindou (window), uash (wash), uear (wear), etc
Yes I've noticed that, however because English is my second language and I learned it primarily by reading than listening, unlike native speakers, I associate it strongly with the spelling of the word, so I have to consciously think about how to pronounce it
Our [ID cards] are pretty regular - they are as big as credit cards and they have a picture, our names, permanent residence address, our Personal identification number, height, eye colour and some biometric data that allows us to travel with our ID within the EEA without a passport
Well i learned basic phrases from school
But 80% of my English is from Games and Youtube videos
Well, I started understanding basic English at around 7, 8 and then developed my knowledge through television and games and youtube videos
This helped me a lot and my uncle is from Manchester and he said that I talk better than most Bulgarians
I'm really grateful for that and I hope I continue learn new languages (I actually know some Russian, this time i learned it through school)
Learned it at 8 and was fluent by 9 , Im Bulgarian so English is very basic in comparison so it was fairly easy
Just read alot thats my tip
I can recognise if somebody is from the Balkans but the different Balkan nationalities are more like generalisations (eg tall person - likely Serb/Montenegrin/Bosniak, slightly darker - somewhere from the south Balkans), but those are not always correct
It's impossible if they're European
Distinct characteristics are often shared in regions and not countries, so you'd have to choose
I can guess most accents in Europe tho
Yes and no
I can guess where they are generally from based on area - those being the UK, Western Europe, Northern Europe, Eastern Europe and the Balkan area
Guessing someone's nationality is more generalisation outside of that
It's honestly mostly the eyes that make it easier to guess, as well as the face shape
Russians have very specific facial features in my opinion, I'm confident I can recognize one in a local crowd
And no, it's not the tracksuits lol
[yes I'm aware not everyone is Caucasian in russia]
Germans always wear sandals with white socks and carry a camera
In other words, painfully unfashionable
The English are usually piss drunk at a bar or eating a kebab right across the street
Turkish tourists have a cigarette in their mouth at all times
I can also spot a Scandinavian pretty easily, especially if it's a tall woman
But what brand of Scandinavian
Who knows
For the most part I can recognize ethnic groups, nationalities is quite different
Ive noticed Bosniaks kinda draw their words out while Serbs just sound like Russians/Ukranians/Bulgarians
No idea how that difference in accents happens
fly + elephant in Bulgaria :)
Hmm, never heard that one actually
I'm probably too young (or from a different region
I'm from central-west)
Never heard it either (Sofia region)
My choice would be „уйде коньо у реката“ translating to "horse went in the river", and meaning "oopsie, shit's fucked".
Why do our idioms abuse animals so much lmao
Whaaat
I thought that Belgium, Swiss and Luxembourg spoke only belgish , swissish and luxembourgish
I don't know if Bulgaria is "reknowned" for our beaches across the rest of Europe but we're cheaper than most of the Mediterranean, as far as Western tourists are concerned
Most popular beach is probably Sunny Beach - it is also the trashiest
Bulgaria has nice beaches
The Netherlands doesn't, but they have huge docks that allow for efficient trade
Waar
Terschelling
Misschien genoeg voor een Nederlander maar valt in het niets vergeleken met het strand in Bulgarije
There is a favourite alternative rock band of mine from Bulgaria which is called Hayes & Y. They sing in English so that would make them accessible
Also, there is this great formation called Oratnitza which uses uncommon musical instruments and make music with motives from national folklore songs and a more "modern" sound
It's an interesting fusion so I recommend that you at least hear them even if it is not your cup of tea
Sofia and literally every other part of Bulgaria
Reasons:
- Sofia is the only place in the country with significant population growth (there are 3-4 cities where the population remains stable, everywhere else is in a nasty demographic crisis)
- Sofians are significantly richer than the average Bulgarian
- Almost all economic and cultural activities take place in Sofia (a bit of it also goes to the aforementioned 3-4 cities)
- Sofians are on average much more liberal than the average Bulgarian
This is why:
- According to Sofians, the rest of the country is either a Sofian suburb or backwards underdeveloped unpopulated countryside
- According to the rest of the country, Sofians are privileged snobs who are ready to sacrifice their health (air quality in Sofia is deplorable most of the year) in order to make more money
- According to Sofians, the rest of the country is backwards
In Bulgaria, it’s probably Plovdiv and Varna, the 2nd and 3rd biggest cities
Always arguing about which city is the second biggest (Plovdiv always seems to win by a couple of thousand)
Varna is the so-called sea capital, Plovdiv gets a lot of new investments ever since the highway in the South was built (the highway Sofia-Varna has been in construction for 46 years; yep, you read that correctly)
It’s mostly a nice and humorous rivalry, tho
As someone from Varna, even I can’t not chuckle at T-shirts that say “Make pLOVEdiv, not WARna”.
There’s also a general Sofia vs
the rest of the country
People from “the province” (as people in Sofia call them, you can imagine that term is really not popular with non-Sofians) see Sofia equal parts as the shiny castle on the hill, but also the evil stepmom that gets the bulk of the money in the country and pretends anything outside of the Sofia Ring Road doesn’t exist
The truth is somewhere in the middle, imo
Drop a few nukes on Paris and see the whole France disintegrate
I am not Cypriot but I live in Cyprus, the reunification is important to the Greek Cypriots such as my friends
The frying of cut potatoes was invented by the Irish
You may have perfected it but you did not invent it
>Only **Yeltsin** and Medvedev were 100% Russian
There were rumors that he was Estonian
We have separate years
Like, say, 5-8 grade we'd learn only about Bulgarian history and relations with our neighbors (eg
wars with Byzantium, Latins etc) and then 9-11 grades would be for European/World history and finally 12 is like a big overview of Bulgarian and 19/20th century world history (we do learn 19/20 century history before that so 12th grade is mostly as I said overview for the matura test at the end of the year)
Every Bulgarian and Greek has experienced a "difference in perspectives in the historic events" with North Macedonia
> It's the North Macedonians who have am entirely different story
That was what I was talking about
What I meant was that due to the heavy government propaganda, North Macedonia for decades claimed parts of the history, culture and legacy of Greeks and Bulgarians
It's been better for the past few years, but if you go to a North Macedonian news website and see the comments (which I can easily understand, as the languages are nearly identical), it's... harsh
Really harsh
Like, I get that people wouldn't trust sources and governments and people that have clear interest in the matter
I get they don't trust what Greeks and Bulgarians are saying
What I don't get is why they distrust what **everybody else** is saying, because it's the same thing
In North Macedonia, especially on the far right, there are these ideas that Bulgaria and Greece have somehow managed to convince Germany, the UK, Italy, France, Spain, Russia, the US and basically the whole world to teach "our" version of history and it's some massive anti-Macedonian conspiracy
I don't get that at all
One can fall in a rabbit hole of absurdity if they checked the North Macedonian Wikipedia - half of Bulgarian, Greek and even some Serbian national heroes are claimed as Macedonian
Meanwhile, 100 000 North Macedonians have received Bulgarian citizenship in the past 15 years
It's hilarious on a table with friends while drinking
It's not hilarious when it becomes government policy
Imagine if Canada just started claiming that Lincoln was Canadian and explaining that him being an American is a big conspiracy
Oh, this, absolutely this
Especially Americans love to tell us what is Socialism and what is Communism while having absolutely no idea whatsoever
Yes
I have a bunch of clothes i wear only when i'm home (and maybe to the grocery store)
You can't really chill/eat/cook with the same clothes you go for coffee with friends
Of course, everybody I know does
I walk my dog with them on sometimes
we have it in Russia too
I asked my wife and in her school it was exactly like you wrote
Version from my school made no sence but was less offensive and rhymed
"Mom is cat, dad is Baba Yaga(???), and I wasn't born the best one, I was deformed"/ "Mama koshka papa yozhka a ya ne urodilsya krivenkim rodilsya".
I have had quite some time spent on EU4
Unless I am trying a specific achievement I usually end up playing with Sweden, one of the Germanic princes (if in the north I go for Prussia of course), Japan or Ethiopia
I have had quite a lot of game starts with Ethiopia and I love the Coptic religion mechanism, their interesting starting position and the ability for expansion/colonisation
Occasionally, I like a Burgundian or a Dutch start and be stinking rich and conquer the British isles
After a certain patch I find it pretty exciting to start as some North American tribe and try to fight back those filthy colonisers
Prague or Istanbul
Prague , because I want to experience this amazing culture and just to walk these old streets
Istanbul - I miss Istanbul - the people, the little streets, the feeling to be lost in the crowd, the food
London
My aunt lives there and I really want to visit her and her family
I had planned a trip to Valencia for my daughter to see the Oceanographic Museum fir her birthday
If the season is right this will be the first
Otherwise maybe Prague or Berlin
Zurich
Was on a school trip about a decade ago through Europe, and Zurich was beyond anything a bunch of Bulgarian middle school children have ever seen in luxury retail
We had the whole day to ourselves there, and we had a little game where we split in small groups to roam the city center and whoever finds the most expensive watch first would get  free lunch from the others
Needless to say, it was funny to see those Swiss Rolex shop workers approaching courteously a bunch of kids with ragged backpacks and faces full of wonder
Also, the most expensive watch we found was 1
2 million €, which was surprisingly high for something sitting in a storefront
Bulgarian Parliament
So many rich people, must be easy to get rich when you steal from 7 million people at once
A Burgas suburb filled with Russian businessmen expats
The houses were barely houses, they were closer to mansions
Yeah, it was embarrassingly expensive
Even in the supermarket we could barely afford a candy bar (which came in around 3 Chf - about 8 times more expensive than what you would usually pay for the same brand back home)
>People refusing to talk to you in stores there the moment they realize you're some low class
Oh yeah, I remember that signature look of superiority and subtle sense of contempt when you say "We're just looking around
There is a Chrysler in my neighbourhood with a Virginia license plate
I once met a guy who was travelling from Berlin to Istanbul in the [gymnastic wheel]
Either маймунско "а" [maimunsko a] (monkey "a") or кльомба [klyomba] ("badly written letter")
We call it:
* кльомба (klyomba) - I have no idea what it means but it sounds like something round and blobby
* маймунско а (maymunsko a) - “monkey a”
* маймунка (maymunka) - “small monkey”
Its either маймунско а (maymunsko a) "monkey a" or кльомба (klyomba) wich I don't think can be translated as something other than @ .
Most people call it "маймунско а"(monkey a), I just call it "at", bacouse it is shorter and easier
When shops don't work on a Sunday or that there are far less 24/7 shops
Oh and pharmacies in Greece just decide not to work at some point during the day cause "fuck it there's another pharmacy down the road" but the motherfucker down the road is thinking the same thing so he's also closed
When you get to Rome you get two countries for the price of one
100% Obviously Turkey, like i wouldn't even be surprised with the recent bullshit they've been doing they might just turn their eyes West
Turkey
Again
Russia
Lol as if you wouldn't cheer the Germans on as they leisurely waltz in
Nah, y'all have been doing well in relations with the EU and NATO
Also I think I would be right in saying that no Bulgarians or Romanians would have morale in fighting Serbs
Weeeell
Russia is messing in our stuff, and in other European nations, pretty actively
Buying politicians, even whole parties, and paying for political propaganda and misinformation
This started relatively recently, probably 4-5 years ago
Trolls commenting under our medias and in the social medias
Even creating chaos and because of lies and conspiracies
So yeah, that's one of the reasons why some countries are afraid (or dislike) of Russia
Mind you, I'm talking about the politics and the actions, I have Russian friends and it's not the people's fault
Though, I don't think Russia would ever invade a NATO country
Or that NATO will invade Russia
Russia just creates chaos by different means
Naah, bro, the Turks are already in Viena
Haven't you been recently there :D
btw also was surprised by how often I've heard Bulgarian as well
Two or three times on the streets for one day
When there is a will, there is a way
No, taking advantage of and attacking an unsaported kurdish people, who have been trying to get independence for God knows how long
Sure they're a threat, maybe to your blessed and righteous, almighty leader who doesn't know how to manage internal problems so he creates external ones to distract the uneducated people who worship him like a God
I mean shit, okay, my bad then
I still think Erdogan is a bad leader besides that though, seeing how "well"  Turkey's economy is doing
Considering that one Bulgarian lev is like a billion liri ot doesn't sound good
>Saying that Turkey attacks "Kurdish people" when fighting PKK/YPG is like saying that US attacks Afghans when fighting against Taliban or Muslims when fighting against ISIS
Would be a lot more convincing if you weren't ethnically cleansing Kurds and replacing them with Turkish allies
>PKK has a long history of carrying out terrorist attacks in Turkey and is designated as a terrorist organization by all countries of NATO & EU as well as some others, Turks are not okay with having their Syrian branch on Turkish borders
A potential threat does not give Turkey the right to invade and conquer parts of neighboring countries
>This isn't about Erdogan, I hate him yet still support the operation - opposition parties support it as well, it's a matter of national security for us, not politics
Of course: alll Turks on Reddit hate Erdogan and all support everything he does
None, his way of talking was just a bit more informal, like "ain't". The way everyone talks but no one spells
So for example "all" in his speech would be spelled as "'сичко", instead of "всичко".
We use the word pishtov (gun) for it
There's also the term "tsarski pishtov", literally "the tzar's gun" for when you completely switch the papers with something you've filled in beforehand
Like a ready done essay for example
In Bulgarian it's similar - the word is пищов (pishtov)
It means "pistol".
I googled ethymology of this word in Russian, "shpargalka", and apparently, it comes from Polish word "szpargał".
Not really
Some schools had them but don't use them, but a typical school corridor looks like [this] and a typical class room - like [this]
The schools that I have studied at and am currently studying do, however I personally don't use them as the the breaks between classes aren't very long and there isn't enough time to do anything else but grab your books if you use the locker
That's why I just prepare the things I'll need for the day in the morning and keep them in my backpack
This idea has always been very very weird to me
Why
You just bring a backpack to school, you just have it with you You aren't bringing a suitcase for a sleepover
4 hours in school and you're gone
Another reason we have no lockers is because our schools are most often on "shifts". Considering the school usually can't even accomodate all their students at the same time, it's pretty unlikely they'd be able to provide lockers either
[Hristo Botev] \- one of our national heroes
That's rookie numbers, my backpack was over 6kg when I was 8
Bulgarian
1,000,000 - милион (million)
1,000,000,000 - милиард (milliard)
1,000,000,000,000 - трилион (trillion)
1,000,000,000,000,000 - квадрилион (quadrillion)
Million = милион (milion)
Billion = милярд (miliard)
Trillion = трилион (trillion)
Quadrillion- квадрилион (kvadrilion)
Same shit here
I've heard there's a really big underground system below Sofia, but I've never been or heard more than some murmurs about it
Some photos here and there, but not much
Fast internet and corruption
Ruins and corruption :(
We have lots of caves
And we have a lot of bats like waaaay more species than Romania (suck it up Drakula)
I mean
Aren't we worse off than you guys are
Pretty good bbq as well tbh
Partially thx to Stalin btw
Oh and I forgot
We have the largest percentage of citizens living outside our own country
Okey let's just say we and romania are super corrupt like top tier corrupt
Wait, don't Russia and the Ukraine have the biggest border dispute right now
at least u got lakes
It's an awkward thing to do especially for half of the passengers which are on the back
Fuck any authoritarian party
Italy looks like a boot kicking a ball
That's kind of aesthetic
In school they teach us that Bulgaria looks like a lion (it is the national symbol of the country)
To me personally, it always looked like a puppy
I would say it's hard to tell if any fluent balkan speaker has it as their first language or not
We're taught (forced) to adopt a semi-British accent throughout our education, so only the ones who didn't do well in English class have a very noticeable accent
"Гушкаш букета" Or "Hug the bouquet', cuz u know
When u die you hug some flowers
Our communist leaders allegedly set up companies in western Europe under the nose of the Soviet Union, to do some money laundering as soon as they saw the the communist downfall coming
Shake your head side to side for yes and shake your head up and down for no
I'm surprised how Bulgaria is sometimes called an empire since we've never had an emperor, only tsar/knyaz (khan before that)
Btw at school we've barely mentioned how Bulgarians have taken over other countries but they make sure we don't forget we were under Byzantine rule for 2 centuries and under Ottoman - for 5
The great powers at the time couldn't afford to have a combination of Bulgaria and Romania because it would absolutely dominate the region and throw off what they thought was a balance of power at the time
It would be like a Germany/France in the Balkans, just had to do some developing to catch up with them at the time
No idea
I would take a guess but honestly can't think of anything that even remotely makes sense
In Bulgaria maybe the Trace region is the odd one out
there are more Muslims than Christians which are the majority here
Кърджали. I believe it has the largest Turkish minority of anywhere in the country
I feel bad because Macedonia was my first thought
but would agree on this one, lol
Съсипаха я тая държава
Mostly Turks
I believe the Turkish people there pronounce it more like КърджАли
Chalga or "pop-folk", full stop
Sung by either silicone girls looking like third-rate porn stars or sweaty fat men in white suits orgasmically moaning about money, drinking and women
Made for bellydancing and drunk ululations and snapping fingers while sticking greasy money bills to the dancers' foreheads, all easy things to do for drunk, trashy people
An unholy mix of gypsy music and stolen Serbian turbofolk and, recently, also the worst of silicone MTV soft-porn r'n'b, passed off somehow as a continuation of authentic Bulgarian folk music with which it has nothing in common
It is a song from the early days of our pop folk or as we like to call it chalga
Enjoy
Don't forget this gem, which manages to encompass the filth of chalga while mixing with pseudo-rap and trashy pop:
Jumping on this thread to present this [masterpiece]
my new favourite description of chalga thank you
Turbofolk, chalga and manele are the Balkan trifecta of Trash Music
Slavi is one of the pillars of chalga, always has been
Begone
*holds up a cross*
I was gonna post this one, u beat me to it
I posted some links in the thread, but what's so awesome about divas and fat sweaty guys glorifying money and sex
Mainly our brotherly neighbors in Serbia, Macedonia, and whomever has migrated abroad, I believe
We're all in this together
I lived with my parents until I was 24, during Uni and about 2 years of working
A friend of mine went to Uni abroad for 4 years and then came back and lived with her parents until they were 26
Did not have a problem bringing my partner over, as long as you were quite and respectful, it's all good
In general the culture here is that you don't really need to leave your home unless you really decide to yourself
Parents usually feel okey with having you around
It is nice to help financially or in any other way if possible, but most parents are just happy you are still around

I don't have one, because I don't bake peppers, but many people have one
it’s a special kitchen appliance for cooking/roasting red or bell peppers
They are delicious
They work in salads, sauces and meals
They can be eaten raw, pickled, baked, fried and boiled
Wtf this sentence sounds just so right, the commas are perfect
One simple trick if you don't remember those pesky irregular past tense forms
People names definitely should keep pronunciation
The alternative is lame
From the two options, I would say it's closer to "make sex
" However, ***правя*** can mean ***do***. For example, ***Правя нещо*** commonly means ***I'm doing something*** although it also means ***I'm making something***. So it can be translated as both ***make sex*** and ***do sex***.
Here is not very popular,  but poppy seeds are added on sweet buns, rolls and stuff like that,  sesame seeds are still more popular but poppy is a close second
No one I know or heard about think you can get high with poppy seeds

We call it "duck language", and we add "па" (pá) to every syllable, in the beginning, I think
It's been a while since I've heard it but here's my attempt
(A duck is „патица“ - „pátitza“)
„Можеш ли да говориш така?“ - Can you speak like this
„Памопажеш пали пада пагопавопариш патапака?“ - Pacan payou paspeak palike pathis
Transcribed to Latin script: „Pamopazhesh pali pada pagopavoparish patapaka
500 year long Ottoman rule which stopped all country development for 5 centuries
Actually agree on how the land would be split between Bulgaria, Greece and Serbia after the first Balkan war
If there was a reasonable compromise, the history of the Balkans in the 20th century would have been much different
The Balkans have the Hajduks/Hajduti
Basically guerilla fighters from that time period (19th century) against Ottoman tyranny (or law, depending on the POV)
Bulgaria had a lot of them - typically simple village folk having enough of Turkish repression and taking up arms
They formed bands (cheta) either in the home land or abroad in Serbia or Romania (I.e. the First Bulgarian Legion)
They often made camp in the mountains and did a lot of raiding, taking coins from governmental convoys or sabotaging Imperial infrastructure
At the time there were also Muslim raider bands (kurdzhalii), which did their raiding against Christian settlements due to the weak Imperial government at the time, so the hajduts also protected the said settlements and fight the Muslim raiders
There were similar movements in Greece and Italy
The Italians didn't have a Myslim overlord though, so their story is a bit different
Haiduti
They were guerilla fighters during Ottoman times
I remember my teacher said that the haiduti fought for revenge while normal revolutionaries fought for change, don't know how true that is but generally, the haiduti are positively viewed here
(although I wouldn't be surprised if they committed war crimes, being a lawless militia and all)
Completely unrelated but we're taught Don Quixote in eighth grade here, thought it's cool
Bulgaria uses that too
If you want something cool to read you should check out Bulgarian and Byzantine relations, there were a lot of wars, peace treaties, and some very brutal battles
It's not
Looks neat
There is a government committee that sets the price of electricity
Also if a manufacturer lists a price as set price, rather than recommended price, you have to sell it at that price or not at all
Newspapers and cigarettes are sold at fixed prices right now
Doesn't matter where you are, the price of your box of smokes is the same in every store, even if everything else costs triple
We used to learn about the Yalta conference as somewhat of a 'bruh' moment
I'm gonna set aside the military agreements as they are well known
I don't know how much of it was fiction but I remember reading about Stalin and Churchill quite literally dividing the Balkan states among the west and the east on a piece of napkin; one would write up the names they wanted and the other would correct, if necessary
After a couple of passes that was that; no words uttered

Im Bulgarian but ive lived in England for my whole life and i think that english can be very easy but its not the easiest since all the grammar rules makes it confusing
It's pretty easy to learn
It's basically everywhere, no gendered words, easier grammar
now Bulgarian (native), English and learning German
When I was little I just watched English cartoons, but boy German is way too complicated
Very easy actually, compared to spanish or german
My partner has been trying to learn Bulgarian
There's so little resources available it's crazy
His favourite word so far is Shisharka (pinecone)
We named our cat that
I've been born here and still struggle as Bulgarian is rich in words and, bruh, our writing grammar, the f is this thing
We call Beijing Pekin, Munich is Myunhen and Edinburgh is Edinburg
We also pronounce Washington with a hard V - Vashington and we still use Bulgarian names for most cities in Northern Greece and European Turkey, most notably Thessaloniki is Solun and Edirne is Odrin
In Bulgarian, it's almost only nearby places in the Balkans that can have a very different name than the one established in English
* Thessaloniki is **Solun**
* Adrianople/Edirne is **Odrin**
* Constantinople/Istanbul was historically **Tsarigrad**
English - Bulgarian
Beijing - Pekin
Pyongyang - Pkhenyan
Thessaloniki - Solun
We call it Viena
Ha, it's Dunav (Дунав) for us in Bulgaria
Yes, we have [bgmaps] картата в BG Maps:"

For some time the numbers on some maps wrongly assumed normal numbering
Yes and no
I use Moovit, which is an app, that helps u when catching your bus or subway and tells you when and how to catch it
You can set a desired arrival time which is very handy
It has a great map of the main cities in Bulgaria and their public transport
I love it
As a new student in my city this was very helpful
Also it's very helpful for foreigners to get to all of Sofia's museums and sites
For hiking in Bulgaria, [BG Mountains] is king
1 lev - 1 bread or 1 packet ? (plastic jar
) yogurt
10 leva - 1kg
pork chops
100 lv
- 2 weeks worth of food for a single person like me .
Bulgaria, Sofia, very roughly, as order of magnitude
1 lev - crap Lavazza capsule coffee from a street kiosk, 10 leva - lunch main course in the city center, 100 leva - two monthly public transport passes or three months of gigabit internet
Edit: 2 leva \~ 1 euro
First we learn cursive
after 4th grade we can write the way we want
In Bulgaria we must write in cursive in school
Last time I ate one was a fire roasted octopus in a tavern in Nea Platia south of Thessaloniki
I like it, but I don't try to cook it myself
It sounds normal to me, I've eaten octopuses , calamari etc
and find them delicious
The entire northeastern region (Vidin, Vratsa, Montana etc
) is the perfect meme target - it's the poorest and most backwater region in the country, plus they have a funny accent/dialect
They usually get portrayed as basic drunks, really poor and who exclusively listen to Serbian pop-folk (a Balkan type of music)
The other one is Pernik, a town near the capital
The running joke is that they only drive VW Golf, made to be as loud as possible, and enjoy beating each other up on a daily basis
Despite all the comments in this thread, there are many more Europeans who move to the US than vice versa
I find Europeans to be very prejudiced against the US, thinking they're better, more cultured, more friendly, etc
A lot of them have never spent any real time there beside being tourists
The American society doesn't reflect my values and the job opportunities I have in other countries, are far superior than those in the US
As a physician, I would be constantly endangered by lawsuits
Besides, I would be very far away from my family
As a European who has lived in America for about 15 years now and want to move back to Europe soon, it really reaffirms my decision to move back to Europe since I hear everyone talking about how much they hate America
I have never ever witnessed such conversation, but I doubt people would be against it
I imagine it is not something that comes up in a day to day conversations, but it will be completely understandable from an expecting mother to inquire about it
The "official English name"? Mate, what
The names of the countries in English aren't the "official" ones
If there is an official name of a country, that is the name in their native language and all others are translations or variations of it, including in English
And to answer your question - all of them
Obviously
There is a difference in literally all names, even if it's just a pronunciation difference
Croatia - we call it Hărvatia (Хърватия)
Montenegro - we call it Černa Gora (Черна Гора)
China  - we call it Kitai (Китай)
Can't think of any other ones
99,9% of our country names are identical to the english ones, for example Anglia, Finlandia, Franzia, Ispania, Norvegia, Ukraina, Moldova, Rusiya, Turtsiya, Sărbia, etc
Funny thing about Bulgaria is that our name is so consistent throughout history that there are no other names for Bulgaria from other countries
Croatia-Хърватска(Hurvatska)
Sweden-Швеция(Shvecia)
Switzerland-Швейцария(Shveicaria)
Montenegro-Черна Гора(Cherna Gora,directly translated-Black Forest)
Your edit doesn't correct your biggest mistake - that the English name is somehow the official one
It is not
The official name isn't Germany, it should be Deutschland if anything
That's the point, IT IS NOT THE OFFICIAL NAME
There are many
I suppose "Аз съм българче" (I am Bulgarian) is the most appropriate for the topic
We have to learn it by heart in elementary school and if you don't know all its words your patriotic grandfather can become very disappointed
Because you sold it at a profit
That's the smart thing to do hehe
Свещената римска империя. The literal translation of Holy Roman Empire
Yes
Bulgarian at one point had ~50% Ottoman Turkish vocabulary, (can't remember when it started chanign, maybe late 1800s or early 1900s? Too lazy to look it up right now) so there has been a gradual replacement of those terms with Slavic origin words
Every newer generation uses less and less of them
There is a significant difference between the number of them in my own vocabulary vs
that of my parents, vs that of my grandparents, great-grandparents, etc
Ottoman Turkish vocabulary was, as others have said, itself comprised of a lot of Persian and Arabic loanwords among Turkic ones
You can still hear a lot of them in Bulgarian folk songs
But generally now, if there is a common Slavic alternative, many are regarded as more informal and sometimes crude
Sort of
Here people only talk about words that have a Bulgarian equivalent but we end up using the loan word more often than not
We actually have two different words depending on the origin of the loanword - чуждици [chuz'ditzi]° which is used for words that existed in Bulgarian, essentially replacing a Bulgarian word and заемки [zaemki], which is used for words that did exist in Bulgarian
No one would complain about the word *skateboard* [скейтборд] but some people would complain about the usage of the word алтернатива [alternativa] because we already have the word възможност [vuzmoz'nost]°. Some people claim that modern words are being replaced by English words (say the word for friend, user, fashion
) but I personally rarely see that happen
Anecdotal evidence, technically, so don't take my word for granted, it could just be the people I know
Funnily enough, a Bulgarian writer from the 19th century named Ivan Bogorov wrote about purism
He tried to push towards the use of Bulgarian words
And ended up being memed instead
The most popular one would be him replacing the word for match°° with the word 'strike-burn-stick' (драсни-пални-клечица [drasni-palni-kletchitza])
What's even funnier is that it actually passed - there are some old match boxes that were used by soldiers with the words 'Български пали-дръвца' [bulgarski pali-druvtza] or *Bulgarian burn-stick'°°°.
° No idea how to write ж with latin letters
Think of it as the second g in garage
Or as how someone French would pronounce that second g.
°° Кибрит in Bulgarian, coming from the Turkish word for match
°°° Technically, дръвца means 'small tree' but it can also be used to mean something wooden from a tree as well, like a stick
> mokrostupy
That is hilarious lmao
Can you give some examples
I find this interesting
I know right, it literally made me laugh out loud
Some of those have analogues or kind of analogues in Bulgarian so I get what you mean, it would be really weird to use words like that when talking about those things, lol
It's just not the same
Aha, I see what you mean now
It makes sense to me as a Bulgarian speaker because we also have djezve, and it's the specific thing you're talking about while something like "kavnik" would just be a general coffee making thing (if it was a word)
I agree that English is much more influential in not just Slovenia but many other countries as well
The young generation in Bulgaria especially uses more and more English words through exposure to English language media with Youtube and the rest of the internet and so on
When I was learning it I would confuse store and magazine, because store in Bulgarian is "magazin".
I've accidentally said I'm going "to the magazine" a few times, lol
I don't usualy mix up words but tenses I had a real hard time with
I'm a huge grammar/spelling nazi, so I don't really mix words up and I'm the one correcting everyone else (if they say it's OK, that is)
But sometimes my mouth doesn't obey me when I'm speaking too fast and I say "world" instead of "word" and vice versa
It's embarrassing because I create the impression that I really mix those two up
Vasil Levski or Ivan Vazov .The people wanted to make the first guy (Vasil Levski) a real saint, but the church did not accept that
Look him up on wikipedia, he has a n interesting story and Ivan Vazov is something like the greatest Bulgarian poet
I’d say Vasil Levski
Good luck with that
Communism
I don't know the name of the job but its about those guys who prepare the dead bodies to be buried
(Taking the body, cleaning it, sewing it, putting make up, putting ither clothes)
You just need to have a strong gut to work this kind of job
It depends on the courses of actions that the Union takes
With the most recent decisions I'd say more and more countries will be wishing to leave
Belgium, Denmark, Portugal, Spain, Norway, Italy, Austro-Hungary and Sweden also had colonial empires
Did I miss you
Wow, I don't know how that happened, I even pulled up a list of colonial powers and copied them here
Real sad Dutch noises
Nah, the Roman Empire is definitely Italian
But he's talking about colonial empires
Otherwise, we too had an empire
What I consider an empire is irrelevant
Bulgaria had an empire - this is a historic fact
Ottoman Empire was not a colonial empire
I'm sorry, but that's just disingenuous
The Romans were an ancient Italian tribe
Their descendants are the Italians right now
The Roman state is decidedly Italian
Whereas, the "Latin" legacy is just other tribes conquered by the Romans (that includes other Italian tribes) and latinized
The descendants of the people who lived in Hispania can't claim that the Roman empire (and republic) was somehow theirs
That position is one based in historic fact; the fact that one filthy regime decided to politicize it is irrelevant
Its historicity is not somehow tainted
The basic fact is that the descendants of the Ancient Romans today are called Italians (mostly from around Rome and south of it)
As I just said in another comment, the people descending from ancient tribes that were conquered and then latinized have no right to claim that their ancestors were somehow responsible for the Roman legacy
They are not
It is implied
They were fully integrated in Roman society in their lands
Because they were latinized
This has nothing to do with who is actually ruling, who is responsible for the state, who leaves a mark on history
Most of them didn't even have Roman citizenship until The Edict of Caracala in 212 AD
It's absurd to claim that the people who lived in Gallia or Hispania are somehow descendants of Romans and can lay claim to their achievements
For fuck's sake, the Roman Empire conquered the lands that are now Bulgarian, can I lay claim on the Roman Empire being my ancestors' just because some Thracians most probably fucked some Romans and 2 centuries later some Thracians most probably fucked some Bulgars and Slavs
Of course not
I agree, I said the same thing here:
I didn't say all Italians are Roman descendants, I said that the Roman descendants are Italians
But, again, that doesn't mean that the Roman legacy is somehow shared between all peoples that were conquered by Rome
Otherwise, why don't we just share Napoleon's legacy
Or Hitler's for that matter
That's not how it works
Claiming that the Roman legacy is yours if you're a Frenchman, for example, is cultural appropriation at best
And I don't think any French person would actually claim it
All European nations have vast and rich histories and cultures, there's no point in claiming someone else's.
And if I may add, because you mentioned the Fascist regime - while it is an extremely repulsive regime, they were right about one thing - you can be proud of your country's history
Of course, keeping in mind that every nation has done reprehensible things in the past
You can be proud of the Roman republic or empire, while not being proud of the genocide that Caesar performed on the Gauls or not being proud by the slavery
Mussolini politicized something normal and brought it to the extreme
But that simple thing is not inherently bad in and of itself
I couldn't remember the first part entirely so I did counsel with Google Translate to double check
Ich werde dich wie einen Eclair füllen
I'm apologize to anybody who knows German
But I regret nothing
Kuusi palaa which in Finnish apparently means  gazillion different things depending on the context
Gör Sverige lagom igen
Yes in Russian as well as in Bulgarian is spelled like that: да. Ha det bra
Bubble gum Turbo when there is retro week in Lidl, paper 2 Leva note (now the 2 lv

What about [the 1 lev note]
Well it strike the nostalgia bone, but I have not seen one in 20 years, and 2 leva note is still seen here and there
Don't give up your dreams to follow those of someone else
Krasimir Avramov with Illusion back in 2009
We only got a few points from North Macedonia and Turkey if I remember correctly
I met my best Czech friend because he decided to scream "you have big tits" in Czech to the girl who presents the new year's eve national concert in the capital
He was right behind me when he did it
The main difference is that when Austria does something stupid they kindly excuse themselves while the Germans take the beating
jk :)
It doesn’t sound weird to me because in Bulgarian it’s always been Чехия (Chehia)
Nobody says Чешка република (Cheshka republika) in everyday speech, it sounds way too official
We've always called you Чехия (Chehiya) so not much different on our side
It's weird when I see a British person, for example, say it the same way now tho
I mean Czechia is more "unique", but it sounds awful
The Czech Republic is better, but it's weird
I mean it's like saying The Bulgarian Republic instead of Bulgaria or The Slovenian Republic instead of Slovenia
Yes, but I have seen Чешка Република often
How is it better
Why would you want to say Bulgarian Republic or Italian Republic instead of Bulgaria or Italy
It is, but I was writing it as the Czech Republic is written
It's got to be [this one]
I like the current tricolour, I think green makes for a very pleasant addition to a flag
Though my favourite through history is probably [this] It would look weird right now though, since it's similar to some Nordic and UK flags (having a cross and all) and the colours are the same as (North) Macedonia's.
Wait this is an option
I love the current flag but that is incredible
Revnost - jealousy over someone's affections
Zavist - envy
Not interchangeable
We only have it as an adjective, "revnosten", meaning passionate or staunch in regards to a position - a supporter or opponent to something
Jealous, on the other hand, is "revniv".
Could be a loanword
Bulgarian borrowed heavily from Russian during our national revival
Nothing bad with mountains, they are great for defence, i've passed trough Slovenia in 2017 it was gorgeous
Italian, French, English, Greek, Russian, Finnish, Spanish, Serbian
Bulgarian - Благодаря/Мерси
Russian - Спасибо
French - Merci
German - Danke
Italian - Grazie
Spanish - Gracias
Macedonian - Фала
Serbian - Hvala
Montenegrin - Hvala
Bosnian - Hvala
Croatian - Hvala
Surprised to see that many people who knows it in Bulgarian
I hope it's not the "mersi" one which is very informal
On topic: 17 total for me - Romanian, Greek, Turkish (if we count it
), Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian, Slovenian, Ukrainian, Russian, Belarussian, German, Dutch, French, English, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese
Oh right, i forgot about it :D
Благороден - Noble
Delicious noodles
Some people here celebrate the sunrise of the 1st of July
It started as a type of peaceful protest in the 70s, ispired by the song July Morning by Uriah Heep
Usually young people gather by the sea side or up in the mountains the night before, drink, listen to music, sing or just generally chill until the morning
I think they had even started organizing festivals around it
People here are freaking rude man wtf
Like people randomly slamming the phone at me with single word answers
Happened to me more quite a few times
"Swedish steel" is still a denominative for a very high quality steel here
We used to have kings too but then the monarchy got yeeted out of existence in 1946 and with it the kings were gone too
Closest thing we have to a ruler is a Prime-Minister on the 20 leva
Controversial person named Stefan Stambolov who did some shady and almost dictatorial-like shit in the late 19th century
Oil balls
I mean
in theory yes in practice tho
Yes it’s mostly at work
Like especially government people here omg
They sound like they hate everything around them
I like appelflap with coffee
Either backgammon or bridge-belote
Bulgaria is full of seventy-something retirees who do nothing but drink rakia, discuss politics and play these two games all day, every day
Serbs would give you a good run for your money too
A TV show host/singer made a political party
It was initially rejected for "illegally using the national flag" in the logo, so he tried registering it again under a different name
The names were "Няма такава държава" ("There's no country like this", it's kind of like expressing outrage at how bad things are) and "Има такъв народ" ("There's a people like this" which sounds pretty hopeful actually)
I don't know much about them but the gist is outrage at the rampant corruption, and one of their goals is to cut the "nation's representatives" (parliament) by half
Parliament is currently at 240, I believe, and they recently gave themselves a raise
The Netherlands is definitely not big in any metric
Bulgaria is about two and a half Netherlands the size so I'd argue Bulgaria would be the smallest big country
We don't, but the state of BDZh, the company that owns and provides train services is so bad, that it is a miracle we have trains at all
I don't know if that counts as a city, but I'm gonna say Tryavna
It's a beautiful town on the northern slopes of Stara planina with lots of culture and traditions from the Revival period
I absolutely adore Veliko Tarnovo
The city is located on the two hills, separated by a river, it's a steep walk around the centre and it's best to visit it in the spring and summer, because everything around the city is green and due to the hilly character of the city forests around the city are visible and it is just so lush, green and calm
We went to the morgue when I was in the end of elementary school
For sure, it made me ready for high school
Absolutely no Sex Ed
We had a presentation about puberty when we were around 6th grade, and some mention of sex was probably there, too, but the primary thing was that they split the girls and boys in separate rooms for the presentation
The girls got the menstruation talk, no idea about the boys
At this point all of us had already watched porn and most of us were probably masturbating
We've had teachers between 7th and 10th grade taking the time in their class (homeroom or biology, usually) to dive into the topic of their own volition, read informative texts or show movies that educate about how easily HIV can be transferred, and talk about wet dreams and horniness rather than actual sex
In 11th or 12th grade, we had a very graphic presentation (again, split rooms between girls and boys) about STDs that read entirely as fear-mongering to me though I understand the need to promote SAFE sex, it felt like it was to dissuade us from sex at all
Also, it was very late in my opinion - by age 17, the more socially active people in my class were already sexually active
The lot of us learned the majority of what we know from porn, hear-say, and awkward first hand experience
School just explained the cellular level of things
I don't remeber my parents giving me "the talk" neither my school offered sex ed classes
It was porn and internet all along, and i had internet access in 6th grade
Well they are curently trying to start sex ed in 3rd grade
Why does an extra large pizza cost €40
I once read that Sweden was the largest holder of North Korean debt in the world
Now I know why
But you probably earn in an hour more than the average Bulgarian does for a whole day
Ich habe ein apfel
I have no idea how to speak German
Oh thanks that was the only sentence duolingo taught me xD
>I have no idea how to speak German
Lol compared to our fate you're downright lucky
Pyrrhic victory
Pyrrhic victory means a victory that came at such a cost as if you had lost
Russia got decimated in Finland
Even though they won, most people forget and think Russia actually lost the winter war
Every English speaker messes up the name of Sofia - they pronounce it like the female name, instead of how we call it - with the stress on the "o".
Реално на испански е Sofía, даже така си го пишат, с акцента, защото иначе ще се произнася Sófia, голям сакън
Are you from Save Sofia
I knew I have heard your name before, it just took me a few minutes to realise I actually voted for you :D I am surprised to see you on reddit and hope to see Save Sofia on the next elections as well
Good luck
Yeah - the British and the Americans shift the stress to the end of the word, instead the beginning
Siendo búlgara en España, me reí de esto más de lo normal jajajaja
Thank you for your vote :)
Sofia, New Mexico
It was established by Bulgarians :)
Jajajaja, lo se, por eso me reí tanto
Once you're going to the south, beyond melnik is the middle of nowhere for me
Not saying it's a bad place but there's just nothing
I don't really know
I think most of the country is evenly populated so there aren't any places where you are far away from a major city or a town
But I would probably say somewhere in the Rodopa mountain range
I dunno, I've gotten lost with the car in some pretty "middle of nowhere" regions trying to get to zermatt
Joke is on me, to the rest of Europe Bulgaria either doesn't exist or is some enigmatic twilight zone of mystery
Urbanisation is huge here
Villages and small towns are very depopulated
I've been noticing more life in recent years though
I think two groups contribute to this
First are younger people that move out of big cities and buy some house closeby on the cheap, all while continuing working their jobs remotely, planning to do the same in the next years
The other group of people are the expats, which, for the most part, are a very welcome addition
Most are very respectful, learn the language and adopt local customs
All my homies gtfo off Sofia to someplace else thanks to covid enabling them to work remotely
Yup, just came back to this concrete slum after spending 2 weeks in the Elena Balkan at my cousin's. Shit was magical, I can understand why they do it
But not having the homies is a bit of a downside, yes
Exactly
And i'm not joking, basically everyone i know who isn't bound to an office job or a girlfriend is gone
People tell me i'm crzy for paying rent in Sofia when home office from a cleaner,more peaceful and cheaper place is an option
Haha yeah
My cousin slapped his forehead when I told him the rent I pay in Lozenets
It's not all bad about Sofia, but some things you just can't really argue with
Moving out into the countryside is cool if you have a family and kids, but as a young guy, it sound terribly boring
I see why some people go for it though
I don't know but some warning signs (or rather, slogans) made during communist times were downright hilarious
Such as:
"Look both ways before crossing
One second of inattention, dead for life
"Be careful on the road
There are no spare parts for the human body
Vinetka
This sign strikes fear in everyone, cause the road after it is toll-controlled and its often very badly maintained
Generally people wouldn't tell the difference between Rugby or American Football, but we got some fans of both
Milk here is always refrigerated
Eggs can stay on room temperature, but most people refrigerate them anyway
We use our variant of QWERTY (ЯВЕРТЪ), but some psychopaths use ЧШЕРТЪ or ",УЕИШЩ" (the latter being the officially accepted one, yikes)
In English and French, I use QWERTY
The keyboard of my phone combines the two in one keyboard so I can just long press if I want say, à. On my laptop, I have shortcuts (like ` + a = à)
In Bulgaria, we have a layout called Bulgarian Phonetic, which basically maps out the Cyrillic letters to a corresponding latin character
It follows the QWERTY layout (so A goes to A, E goes to E and say, Б goes to be, as it shares the same phonetic sound)
For Russian, I only ever use it on my phone so I usually type on the Bulgarian keyboard and then switch over to the Russian keyboard when I'm missing a letter
Some letters are placed differently on the Russian keyboard so it slows me down
I'm still learning Chinese but I'm otherwise practicing with a pinyin keyboard
It follows QWERTY again
Pinyin basically uses the latin letters to show how a character is read
When typing on a keyboard in pinyin, you will be suggested different characters that correspond to the pinyin and make the most sense
In short - QWERTY but different flavours
As far as I know, this is a macro for apostrophizing vowels in all UK-based keyboards, including the Danish one
While the UK may have a good amount of Roman sites preserved, I would like to argue that places like Greece and Spain have just as many if not even more so I don't think the answer is as "easy" as some people would like to think
On the other hand, the fact you do not see many people in the UK taking pride in their Roman heritage and even outright mocking it may be exactly because they don't have as strong a relation to it culturally
If anything I would argue that there is just as big of an amount of British people proud of the British Empire as there are Italian people proud of the Roman Empire and Greek people proud of Ancient Greece
Fucking northeners man
With such a system, how do you replace the iconic 'hey guys, I brought beer
'? Sharing is caring
Todor Jivkov, the communist dictator, 1956-1989
I don't think I need to explain how
People in the West laugh at people with Eastern dialects and vice versa
People speaking in the dialect used in Sofia are usually seen as stuck up in the East, while an Easterner speaking in their soft tongue in the West (especially in Sofia) will be singled out as "a provincialist".
Bulgarians have more than 200 dialects, so almost every city has its own accent, specific words and phrases and manner of speaking, so many people can't and don't care
People from the Rhodopes speak in a very ancient dialect that is almost unintelligible to the rest of us, while people from Pirin Macedonia speak in the same dialect used by North Macedonia
Nope
It's hard to imagine something like that working here
[Boza] really good, many people don't like it but twice as many love it
Was surprised to find out they had it in North Africa though
Usually I drink it with banitsa
Таратор (Tarator) - a cold salty soup made with yogurt, sliced cucumbers and walnuts
Sounds disgusting, but it is the most refreshing thing  thing in the summer
Trust me on this one
We have 7 cultural and 3 natural World Heritage sites
Here are the cultural ones
Ancient City of Nessebar - Initially a Thracian settlement from 3000 bc, then a Greek colony, then Byzantine, then Bulgarian etc
Really beautiful place with plenty of architecture from various periods
Boyana Church - A 10-12th century church with some very well preserved medieval frescoes
Madara Rider - One of the few remnants we have of the Bulgars
The Mada rider is carved into a 100-m-high cliff near the village of Madara in north-east Bulgaria and has an engraving by one of Bulgaria's early khans
Rila Monastary - Founded in the 10th century by St John of Rila, or more correctly by the students that came to visit him
It became a haven for Bulgarians during the Ottoman days and is probably the spiritual center of Bulgaria
Rock-Hewn Churches of Ivanovo - A complex of rock-hewn churches, chapels, monasteries and cells developed in the vicinity of the village of Ivanovo
Built between 12-14th century
Thracian Tomb of Kazanlak - Dates to the Hellenistic period, around the end of the 4th century BC
It is located near Seutopolis, the capital city of the Thracian king Seutes III
Contains very well preserved murals and paintings
Thracian Tomb of Sveshtari - Discovered in 1982 near the village of Sveshtari, this 3rd-century BC Thracian tomb reflects the fundamental structural principles of Thracian cult buildings
The tomb has a unique architectural decor, with polychrome half-human, half-plant caryatids and painted murals
The 10 female figures carved in high relief on the walls of the central chamber and the decoration of the lunette in its vault are the only examples of this type found so far in the Thracian lands
We have 10 [UNESCO world heritage sites] 8 historical, 3 natural
**Historical heritage**
* [Ancient city of Nesebar] \- a tourist hotspot and coastal resort
The old city is very beautiful;
* [Boyana Church] \- a medieval church with wall murals painted in the rare Paleologue Renaissance style;
* [Madara Rider] \- a stone carving of a horseman, sprearing a lion
It is believed to be made to commemorate Khan Tervel;
* [Rila Monastery] \- a 10th century monastery that is also the largest one in the country and named after the patron saint of the Bulgarian nation;
* [Rock-Hewn Churches of Ivanovo] \- monastic shelter built into the rocks near Ivanovo from the 1200s;
* [Kazanlak Thracian tomb] \- the tomb of a Thracian ruler;
* [Sveshtari Thracian tomb] \- another Thracian ruler tomb
Natural heritage
* [Central Balkan beech forest] \- a centuries-old forest in the central Stara planina;
* [Pirin Natural park] \- one of the highest mountains in Bulgaria and the Balkans, preserving alpine and subglacial natural habitats;
* [Srebarna lake] \- a lake used by dozens or endangered species as a resting stop along their migratory path
Turkey probably has at least another few hidden away undiscovered yet
Should you buy from big foreign company chains (like Lidl and Kaufland) that often get their produce from abroad but often offer much better prices and overall customer experience or support domestic businesses and shop in small local markets that have local produce but have higher prices and often aren't as convenient or as pleasentto shop in (don't have certain categories of items, staff are often rude and act like they are doing you a favour by being there and often haggle for things like items warranty and defective items)
Like, I want to support local producers and businesses but not at the expense of customer experience, warranty of the purchased items and 20-50% higher prices
New Bulgaria
Because there was Old Bulgaria in the region of Crimea in the 6th century
We Bulgarians agree our name is perfect as it is
But I come with a fantastic suggestion for all Eastern (and some Central) European countries: "Not Russia".
Just get a good ol' map and write "Not Russia", "Still Not Russia", "Definitely Not Russia", "Not Even The Same Language Family as Russia", "Not Siberia", etc
I was very surprised to find out that's what it's called in English
You'll always be Hrvatska to any Slavic-speaking nations at least
I know just can't think of other name than Bulgaria
I agree
Istvan, one of the coolest names I've heard
Where do you think alexei comes from
He's bullshitting you, most likely he was trying to sell you the idea of "Europe" consisting only of upscale places in order to sound fancy
When I arrived in Germany, I was astounded by the amount of North Face and Jack Wolfskin logos on people's jackets and backpacks
In Bulgaria it's mostly things like Adidas and Nike as well as smaller brands
That's strange I always thought Ukrainians had a bad opinion of Russia
I really thought you guys hated them even before Crimea
Bulgaria surnames end in ov/ ova or ski/ska
They usually come for the jobs that these people's predecessors had or their names
Middle names also end the same way but they usually come from you dad's name
Ex: Your name is Boris, your dad's name is Kostadin and your surname is Kupenov (this comes from the name for the people who were gardeners for Ottoman officials during those times) --> your full name is Boris Kostadinov Kupenov
No, but I do feel extremely annoyed by the deliberate insistance of English speakers on not learning or even trying to learn how to pronounce names in other languages
Names should not be translated or even transformed to fit the pronunciation of some language
They should be said the same way they are in the native tongue
And the fact that literally no English speaker even tries to do that is infuriating
How can we learn how to pronounce names in Russian, German, Italian, Spanish, French, English and even Polish, but you can't?
I like languages and nuance, so I'm not resentful towards the language itself
As some other people said - the entitlement of some native English speakers is definitely something to roll our eyes at
Don't go to a country with a completely different language without knowing some BASIC sentences, like asking if they speak English, being able to ask for help, or even "thank you
" Yes, your hotel will likely be okay with just English but don't get moody about how the small local pub's staff doesn't speak it, or how the cab driver isn't bilingual, aight
I only resent how people (Bulgarians) tend to elevate it over our own language sometimes, in the sense of "coolness".
Advertisers do this most but commercial artists (singers) add random English phrases or word into their shit, and it's not only annoying and unoriginal - it's nonsensical
We have singers who add phrases that they barely even understand, butcher the grammar and pronunciation, and the idea is that it's "cool".
Another example is something I find with translations of English source material
If something means, quite literally "Blackwood" or "Red rock" or something along those lines, in the sense of conveying the meaning rather than an individual name, people are more likely to use that "original English" way of refering to it, rather than the equally applicable version from our own language
Isn't French still a lingua franca in some parts of Africa and the Middle East
Когато Петър е "Питър", Сара е "Серъ", Хриси е "Криси", а фамилиите ни ги отебали тотално :')
Well yeah, Arabic is a definite lingua franca in North Africa and the Middle East
But I'm pretty sure French was used in that part of the world much like we currently use English, I'm just not sure when exactly it changed
We're kind of all just eyeing Turkey quietly
largely in relation to the "refugee crisis" and their government in general
Definately Serbia
Our foreign policy leans mostly towards the EU and NATO, while Serbia is much closer to Russia
Since April, Serbia is our only neighbour that isn't a member of NATO
There is also the whole Kosovo thing
Personally I don't think that there will be an outright war between my country and Serbia in the near future, but we definately aren't as close to them as our other neighbours
> Bulgaria  - We are in a very good relationship at the moment but there is still controversy around Dobruja
I haven't seen any animosity about Dobruja for a long while
I think as far as ex-Bulgarian territories go, that one is least talked about just because we're basically experiencing the best relations we've ever had with each other
>Bulgaria  - We are in a very good relationship at the moment but there is still controversy around Dobruja
Really
Apart from a few fringe Romanian nationalists claiming southern Dobruja as part of Greater Romania, I can't see any  controversy there
Isn't that "**countries** whose nationalists want to slaughter you"
What else is different in your alternate universe, apart from Bulgaria not bordering Turkey and Serbia being even potentially a threat to Bulgaria
It is highly unlikely that any of our neighbours would attack us
OP asked about the most probable one, not one with actual high chances to invade
Also, why would Turkey try to attack us
Nah, I think we really do have relatively good relations with them at the moment
I'll be glad if it stays that way, but it's disconcerting how your relations with them have deteriorated
>It is highly unlikely that any of our neighbours would attack us
OP asked about the most probable one, not one with actual high chances to invade
The answer to this question is also Turkey
They are the only one of our neighbors who have plausible reasons to want to invade us and the only one who is capable of succeeding
This is not even remotely true for Serbia (outside of some fantasy where the Russian army teleports to Serbia and uses it as a base of invasions) .
>Also, why would Turkey try to attack us
Take your pick:
Turkish nationalists want to bring the Bulgarian Turks back to the fatherland
Neo-Ottomanists want to restore the Ottoman Empire
Islamists want to restore a formerly Muslim territory in its rightful position in the [Dar al-Islam]
And all these groups are far from marginal in Turkey
Fuck this one hits hard as someone with close ties to the Dutch healthcare system
I know a fair amount about Northern African countries
Go South though and I'll have a problem
Hmmm I think the april uprising would make for a very interesting assassins creed game
I would go with the years under Ottoman yoke leading to the Liberation of Bulgaria - a time of хайдути (haiduti), legions that were prepared from abroad, organising the peoples in secret for an uprising
Yup, every year
Yes, definetely
[The Irony of Fate]
And for younger folks I'd say Love Actually but maybe it's just my friend circle
Bulgarians have a joke going that we understand everyone's language but nobody understands ours
80 - 90% - Most Bulgarians can understand Macedonian perfectly but there are some words that are just different, or have a completely different meaning in Bulgarian, so that's where I get confused
I think their regional accents also have a role in that though
50 - 70% - Serbian tends to be very slow and kind of deep, so that makes it easier to understand, though the lexical differences are solid
I can say they share a lot of words with us but for us, those words would often be "archaic" or only really used in very old texts, or different context
40 - 60% - Czech is very easy to understand, in my opinion
It's not as similar as Macedonian or Serbian but it's not too bad
It's easier for me to understand all of these languages when written
40 - 60% Russian is actually extremely difficult, and my comprehension comes from having studied it
The lexical differences are much bigger, and the grammar is insanely different
Russians do not understand other Slavic languages AT ALL, in my experience, with some of the people I've met (who work with other Slavic people all the time
) we might as well have been speaking Chinese
30 - 50% - I can't speak for other languages because I haven't really encountered them much, but Polish is probably the hardest to understand
Plenty of similar words, spelled differently but comprehensible
Slavic languages are notoriously high in mutual intelligibility, so I would say to a large degree
It's really just that the mutual intelligibility is very uneven - speakers of one language understand the others more so than they understand them back
(Polish understand Czech more than Czech understand Polish, Bulgarians understand Serbian more than the other way around etc
**Macedonian**, unsurprisingly, I understand 95% to 100%. It's basically the Southwestern Bulgarian dialect, but dialed up to 11 and with special orhography and random Serbian loanwords
It's very easy for us both written and spoken
**Russian** around 65% to 70%. It's very akin to archaic Bulgarian
Both written and spoken it's quite understandable, and we only need a little bit of learning and preparation to be able to write and speak in it too
**Serbian** I would say 55% to 60%. Written I can understand the meaning almost all the time
Spoken I can understand the jist of it but it takes a lot of focus to follow and won't work all the time
Still, Bulgarian and Serbian are more similar than different
With **Croatian** sometimes it's a bit easier than Serbian, but it's mostly the same
I can't hear any difference from Serbian with Bosnian and Montenegrin
With **Slovene** it's 35% to 40%, it's very similar to Serbian but there's so many words that throw me off
**Ukrainian** 20-30%. This is the last one which I would say is understandable to me, even if only at times
It's a very melodic and beautiful language, but it really depends from sentence to sentence whether I can get the meaning or if it's complete gibberish to me
**Slovak** 10-15% - Mostly gibberish, but noticeably more understandable than Czech and Polish
**Czech** - 5% - 10% - Gibberish for the most part, with the occasional familiar word
Can tell it apart from Slovak and Polish, though, so there's some degree of passive knowledge I have in it just from being a slavic speaker, which is the only notable part
**Polish** 5% - Least understandable slavic language to me
Pronunciation is a big reason for that, it sounds very confusing and the orthography is equally puzzling
I'll get the ocasional word but that's about it
With Sorbian, Belarusian and Rusyn I have basically had no contact so I cannot say
All slavic languages have wild amounts of similarities
The real trouble for me starts with Czech and intensifies with Polish
Macka can mean cat in Bulgarian as well, or a girl/"bird".
Lol didn't even try Bulgarian :(
And then 10% - thick rhodope dialect
Afrikaans is cheating
It's just outdated Dutch with broken grammar to a Dutch speaker
Try out some Kerkrade or "kierkroois"
My dialect is Rhodopean and I will forever resent my parents for being 'fluent' in it but never teaching me to speak it
It's really fascinating
Yeah I second that
Same here
Our language/dialect is авелзаманско but such is life
At least what we can do is try and document as much of it as possible so that it can never die out
Huh haven't seen Bulgaria here yet
Don't we have a special killing method
Umbrella
Death by
Uuhhmm
Playing 15000 kaba gaidas right into your ears :P
In Bulgaria, we have these so called 'language schools'. Your class profile consists of 2 languages - in my case, which I'll use as an example, they were French as a first language and Russian as a second
In 8th grade, I would learn only French, Math, Bulgarian, IT, Music, Art and PE
In 9th grade, all other subjects were added back, along with Russian
Up until 11th grade, we would study History, Biology and Geography in French
It's different in every school though - but it's usually between Math, Biology, Chemistry, History, Geography and Physics
We didn't study anything in Russian but we did study Russian literature
The amount of French and Russian classes also increased every year and near the end, we would study French in French and Russian by mixing Bulgarian and Russian depending on what we were learning
I can't speak for non-language schools but it is staple in every language school and they are fairly common
From what I know there aren't any separatist movements in Bulgaria
Even in places like Kardzali and Razgrad where the majority of people are Turkish ethnically, there arent movements for secession
Although during the 70s and 80s, the communist government thought that Turkish people held a way too positive view of Turkey and that they might want autonomy or more, but the communists were also paranoid idiots so who knows
As far as I’m aware we don’t have one
According to Wikipedia, you have more:
Same in Bulgarian, pronounced the same way as the Romanian - we don't differentiate between rifles and shotguns
We only have one word for lawyer - advokat (advocate but pronounced a bit differently) but English has tons of words - litigator, barrister, attorney, solicitor
Земя (zemya) - Earth, soil and ground
In Russian it also works like this
We just
know
People usually know what happens more often and think about it unless you give them some other context
It's hard  to feel lack of something in you language
For example, I can write "Yesterday I bought my first dildo" and you now have no idea what kind of mental image to have about it
:)  But in Russian you would immediately know my gender
In English you either don't know at all or assume, based on your set of stereotypes
Personally I identify with Europe (i.e. it's values), culturally I also identify with Balkan and Slavic states, we have quite a lot in common (listening to the same kind of music, laughing at the same jokes, having similar folklore and traditions, etc)
I wouldn't say I identify with my city/region that much as I have moved a few times and like all places equally
I played A LOT in the street with friends, marbles, skating, climbing trees
My absolute favourite was role playing Blake's 7 which due to some magic had made it through the Iron Curtain
We made teleportation wristbands from scotch tape rolls
And then of course, playing at the beach
With sand and sticks and shells
Amazing times
Yea , my personal top 3 are :
Rural - I sound like a broken motorcycle, just , RUuuRr
World - Here the sound for me is closer to Woorrd,  that danm L
Literally - again the danm Ls , from my mouth it sound closer to  Litri , Litrali,  something along those lines
As a Russian - England
I fell that two things are almost identical - darker, self-deprecating sence of humour and the way we speak
You know these lists like "What the British say and what they really mean"?  Yeah, we do it too and everything in this lists is usually very obvious to me
Plus, all the imperial/colonial past and baggage is also very similar in pretty much all ways you can imagine
We can take every shitty thing UK did or does in these areas and find something matching in areas surrounding Russia
We have a village called "Churka" which means "dick"
There is a town in Bulgaria called "Дупница" (Dupnitsa) which literally translates to Assville
There is also a village called "Крайници" (Kraynitsi) which translates to limbs
wasn't there something about the route being changed but the chaffeur not being notified
Mmmm cyka blyat, are you speaking Russian ?
And I'm mindblowned
Hopefully I haven't met that many stupid foreigners
From a neighboring country: "Aah
" kind of like a "That makes sense
" type of reaction
"Oh wow, that's like, far away
" when Americans usually don't know anything except the name but they're pretty nice
Sometimes they ask basic questions like "What's it like
", even though they can be a little embarrassed
I don't think there's anything to be embarrassed about though, you can't know everything about everywhere
I was once told "Huh, I've never seen a bulgarian who can speak English
" by a man checking my passport
He came off as pretty rude, specifically when I said "Well plenty of them do
" and he said "The ones that come here don't." Based on the percentage of people I've personally met who study their classes in English there
incorrect
'' Oh, I thought you were American
No reaction at all
You mean no one's ever pulled the ol' "Oh, like Siberia
In Russia
" on you
Tbh there isn't a "set" Turkish look
Darker hair and eyes are definitely more common but you'll find plenty blonde, blue eyed people, and varying skin tones
Coast of Bulgaria - for a hour or something, and it melted right after
We have the same thing here as well, their commercials are super long and scripted, the products are terrible and the prices are high
Honestly, all of the iconic ones I can think of right now are staged portraits
Maybe I'm blanking on some others, and other countrymen can chime in
The most iconic ones would then be of our national hero - Vasil Levski, a Bulgarian revolutionary, known also as The Apostle of Freedom, he ideologised and strategised a revolutionary movement to liberate Bulgaria from Ottoman rule
I personally like [this very popular portrait of his] posing in his revolutionary uniform
Though [this smaller portrait] is the one most used and reproduced, you'd see it anywhere in Bulgaria, so I guess it's the most iconic one
If we're talking more viral and recent ones, I'd say [this photo of a girl and policeman during 2013 protests] agains corrupt government is also one that made the rounds
It's a great photo, maybe a bit overdramatised though
It still does speak tons of current times and recent protests though, so it's iconic
The most beautiful sounding language is, undoubtedly, the one the person you love is using to speak to you
Amongst languages I don't speak, I'd say Scottish Gaelic, Italian, Turkish
pretty much every language is beautiful but these are some of my top choices
Italian is hands down the most beautiful and especially musical language I've heard
I also like Welsh, Japanese and a host of others
There are very few languages I dislike the sound of
French
When a woman speaks it it makes me melt
Portuguese, Faroese and the Celtic languages
Yes, during the third monarchy the Great Powers installed Western nobles as our monarchs, first Alexander of Battenberg and then Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha
Alexander was badass, but overall it was a move to make us a puppet to the league of three emperors and later Austria/Germany
Yes, bouth price/tsar [Alexander Battenberg ] and prince/tsar [Ferdinand ]  were not born in Bulgaria
After our liberation from Ottoman rule, the first two of our monarchs were German
Yes, the young Bulgarian principality and then kingdom were ruled by foreigners
The first prince Batenberg was an Austrian with familial ties to Alexander II of Russia, the second prince and later Tsar was also an Austrian noble
Was he the guy who was not executed in one uprising because he was American (well had american passport I guess)
Same in Bulgaria
Here we have this thing called Name days, it is as the name suggests - a celebration of your name
It comes from the Christian (Ortodox) beliefs that the name you are given is holy and thus should be celebrated
The the 6th of January is Йорданов ден (Jordanov den) day of the name Jordan, also knows as Богоявление (when God has appeared)
It is believed that Jesus was baptized in the river Jordan on this day and God appeared and acknowledged that he is indeed his son
The celebration is an odd one - a cross is thrown in the river from a priest and young men swim or run (depending on how shallow it is) in the water to race and retrieve it
This is considered to clense the water (holy water) and everyone attending takes some home with them
And yes, this is done in the freezing cold waters of January, though it is considered to be done for health
Yordanovden - the catching of the cross, the [Ice dance] in Tundzha, but this year most of these events won't be happening
The song that recently became a traditional part of the horo is called "Vasilka fell in love" and its about a girl that has fallen in love with two guys and has to choose between them
It's probably not the most famous in Bulgaria but it's definitely at the top
It's from Peyo Yavorov's poem- Two beautiful eyes
>Две хубави очи. Душата на дете
в две хубави очи; - музика - лъчи
>Two beautiful eyes
The soul of a child
in two beautiful eyes;-music-rays
It's about his love for an underaged girl which he couldn't marry/be together with because her father forbid them
A year or two later she died from cancer and he wasn't allowed to say goodbye with her, go to her funeral
"На къде душата ми да бяга, и къде да скрия своите сълзи?" from "Ice Queen" by Vasil Boyanov
"Where would my soul go, where should I hide my tears
Yes
She's the sister of another less popular writer, who was also part of the "Thought" literature group
What's more fucked up is what happens after that
The daughter of the Prime Minister falls in love with Peyo Yavorov and sort of stalks him until he marries her
She was used to getting all she wanted in life, so it wasn't something unusual
He did have feelings for her, he wrote poems about her as well, but it was obvious they weren't as good/passionate as the ones for the underaged girl
The Prime Minister's daughter progressively got more jealous and one night it escalated to the point where she reportedly grabbed his gun and pointed it to her heart
Thinking it's not loaded, she pulled the trigger, but it was so she killed herself
Yavorov then tried to shoot himself in the head but the bullet went through his temporal bone, he survived the suicide attempt but was left blind
After that people thought he had killed her so the public's opinion turned against him and many court trials were started against him by her mom/father
One year after the accident he drank poison and shot himself in the head, this time successful
Yeah I don't think we ever will be either
We have Ikea since the early 00s, and its known as a high end furniture store
We shouldn't have to rely on it, but here we are
And in exchange for them potentially scaring Russia off, we get dragged into America's wars
All the Balkans yoghurts are amazing
Most countries have their own style and have perfected it
I buy Polish cheeses every week
There definitely are imported groceries, but only some specific products
Most are either homegrown or from neighbouring countries
There are in the Netherlands
Haven't seen it in Bulgaria yet (though we do have some Russian stores)
This was the best Yugoslavia documentary I have ever seen
I'm sorry, but how can the history of one of the regions of Europe not even be mentioned
Nobody ever talked about Vikings in your History class
It's just bulgarian history
What the hell
We were taught about the history of every region in Europe
Including Scotland, for example
>The Vikings were also only mentioned when it came to the expansion of the Roman Empire in Europe
The Viking age started about 300 years after the Roman Empire fell (at least the Western one)
It seems your History classes really were shit
Probably like 1230s or something
I want to see my hometown (Veliko Tarnovo) when it was the capital of an empire and its beauty and wealth was compared to that of Constantinople
Either the short time between the Balkan wars or during Simeon's golden century
Probably before the bulgars came to the balkans
We dont know much about it so it'd be cool to see and understand what they did
If that doesn't count then during the period with Khan Krum
I wonder if he would allow me to get a skull cup
any time from the 8th of Octomber 1912 to 30th of May 1913
Some of the accents in the Rhodopes are very weird and sometimes hard to understand
Maybe also close to serbia
It used to be we have our first snowfall at the end of October, then nothing until Christmas, when it would start a day or two before, and we'd have snow until some time in March
Now maybe we get a bit of snow during January and February
Had one crazy late snowfall a couple years ago around mid-April, if I remember correctly
Small piercings are often seen on people working in business buildings
I don’t think a single piercing will cause issues but larger ones are are frowned upon
We separate the thousands with intervals and use both dots and commas for the decimal
So 10 000 000
00 and 10 000 000,00 are both right
It seems that there's been a rise in Eastern Orthodox believers in the last 10 years (according to wikipedia) and overall, I'd say it's only an issue if you bring it up during a religious holiday/ceremony or if you're in a smaller, rural area
More younger people are likely to identify themselves as undecided or atheist than older generations
I feel like there's definitely a predominant *Casual Christian* attitude, and going against that norm will certainly ruffle some feathers
i.e: if you refuse to respectfully acknowledge or participate in these holidays (such as Christmas, Easter, and several smaller ones) you're likely to get some abuse from people - relatives, peers, strangers on facebook, whatever
If you voice your differing beliefs that go against the dogmatic principles you're likely to get shut down
(And I don't meant the AlL rElIgIoNs ArE EvIl AnD sTuPiD type of atheist, I mean somebody even making a dry joke about the timeline of Easter or something that's not even *offensive*.)
Our priests have no concept of tolerating anything but absolute unquestioning subordination from their flock
Certainly not exclusive to the religion here, though I've seen very inviting pastors and priests in different Christian denominations
Younger people don't care
Older people may question you
Currently we're more concered with some other leaders being ridiculous (something about a guy carrying around a supermarket bag) but our Prime Minister is a meme *goldmine*.
He started out as a bodyguard, so a lot of the things we make fun of is how thuggish he is
His language (as in, the sort of speech he uses) is very informal, he sounds like the type of dude your dad used to go drinking with and would occasionally ask you to buy them cigarettes when you were 12 because they didn't want to get up from their spot in the café outside your apartment building
So we really like to take the piss about his colourful vernacular
Here in my country we laughed because a person of his position married his teacher
People thought that he is dumb and jokingly or not started saying to their kids not to even think about marrying their teachers
>Будапеща
Budapeshta
The "sht" is written with the letter [щ] You can hear how it's said in Bulgarian in [this video] at the 00:42 mark
For some reason we kept the "a" at the end
I once heard it's because the name entered Bulgarian vernacular when the fortress became a border post when the First Bulgarian Empire expanded as far as there during the rule of Khan Krum
* German, because I kind of like the language and would visit Germany again
* French, because I want to live in Montreal in Canada eventually
* Japanese, because I like hentai
Mandarin Chinese, Japanese and C++.
Mandarin Chinese - I'm actually already learning this but I'm at a beginner level, so the effort lost wouldn't be much
It's definitely an interesting language and has the added benefit of being useful as well
Japanese - I like Japanese culture, plus I'd love to work in either Japan or Korea
I want to develop games and the best industry for that is Japan, currently
C++ - If I could automatically understand pointers, memory allocation and all that jazz, that would be amazing
If computer languages aren't acceptable, I'd go for Korean - same reasons as Japan, obviously
How come you're learning Bulgarian
But Hindi means turkey in Turkey
That's very awesome of you, I can guarantee they will all appreciate it a lot
I tried pronouncing that several times and I gotta say it sounds a lot like the way some people speak Bulgarian, where the vowels are shortened so much that they hardly exist
Countries affected by USSR influence in the past, what is your opinion on the Soviet monuments constructed in your countries
As we all know, the Soviets built a lot of communist monuments related to the Soviet presence in the chosen country, for various reasons
I know that in Poland they have removed almost all of them
If I am not mistaken
Please comment to explain more in-depth the situation
In Czechia they are in the process of removing some of them now
Again comment here also for a better explanation
In Bulgaria, well the population is rather divided on this topic (young vs old)
I honestly don't understand why are we keeping them
I was born way after '89 so this history is nothing to me
They are architecturally ugly and do nothing except divide the population
There are a lot of people (boomers in particular) who will defend these "monuments" with their lives and go and bring flowers to them (like wtf, honestly
) I wasn't really interested in history and when I learned that the Soviets in the end of WW2, when we were allies with the Axis and before the end of the war we switched sides with the Allies, declared war on Bulgaria, invaded as, abolished the monarchy with a fake referendum with 95
6% in favor (yeah right) and made a communist/Soviet puppet state, but some people say they liberated us, like wtf again
I honestly, don't understand these boomers why they defend these monuments with their lives (brainwashed)
We were not under prosecution or occupation from other nations at the time, so the Soviets had no reason to come
Facts state that they declared war on us and occupied us
We were perfectly fine without their occupation
That is why I don't understand why we are keeping these monuments
Bulgaria was founded in 681 and now if you come and visit Bulgaria you will be surrounded with history predominately from the communist era (44 years)
Call me crazy but, I rather see history from the rest 1339 years when Bulgaria also existed one way or another, which is authentic Bulgarian (not commie blocks, foreign monuments of a foreign country and foreign people and very very bad architecture)
Please feel free to comment your opinion about this, whether you are from a country which had USSR influence or not (you can say your opinion from a 3rd perspective and what would you do with the monuments if this happened to you country)
Do you approve of these monuments or disapprove and what are their current status in your countries
I have said it when the demolition of the 1300 years Bulgaria memorial started - the place of the Soviet "Liberators" Army monument is in the Totalitarian Art Museum in Darvenitsa, 1300 years Bulgaria [should have been restored] and slightly modernised and the Memorial of First and Sixth Infantry Regiments should be in the Knyazheska gradina at the place of the Soviet soldier
This way they can be the start/end point of military ceremonies, the May 6th Parade can end there and the new Memorial can be developed as an Honorary guard of Alexander I Battenberg Mausoleum - you know, the first ruler of Liberated Bulgaria
But I guess it could be worse - they could've made this [hideous Skopje 2014 looking shit] around the lion
imo they should just be moved somewhere
Not destroyed just moved and whoever is interested should be allowed to visit them
They didn't liberate shit
The regime started with unfair "trials" that executed hundreds of teachers, doctors, journalists - people capable of thought and influence
I agree that it's a part of our history but it's largely propagating lies
We have better things to do than get rid of everything, in terms of infrastructure, but many of these moments don't deserve shit
(Some, which happen to be built in the Soviet era but are otherwise unrelated to it, are fine
The one I feel we should have kept is the Mausoleum
It would have made for a fantastic space, and location to be repurposed into a museum documenting the ills of totalitarianism, and the symbol of using that building would have been immense
Also, the destruction was comical, and we continue to have an empty space there
As with the monument of 1300, it should have been restored, and an plaque put up documenting what it was while also acknowledging the failures of socialist rule
It’s just awkward as is
We have all these empty or former spaces, that we all know what they used to house
It’s a monument without a monument
I think it would be easier to create one giant hill (around 70 m or what
) and bury that shitty statue under it, as one architect did indeed propose
That way the old retirees won't be that outraged that we "destroy history".
I disagree
A monument standing is a monument inspiring
It might have no effect on you but be sure there are people who would love to see the DDR or the USSR back
If one has to tolerate the monuments of criminal and dehumanizing regimes like the communist one, why not do the same for the Nazi monuments
What about what other countries think about your country having certain statues
After all Russia lost the Cold war and will soon lose the new economic war again
I'm surprised they haven't removed it, considering they destroyed the [Kutaisi war memorial] and that was dedicated to Georgian soldiers who died in WWII
And collapse the metro tunnels of M1, 3 and 4 with the extra weight
No thank you
>It would have made for a fantastic space, and location to be repurposed into a museum documenting the ills of totalitarianism, and the symbol of using that building would have been immense
Agreed
Same goes for Buzludzha
Although
I kinda like the openness without it and the possibilities for a fully pedestrian Battenberg Sq
The subterranean levels of the Tomb are still intact and they can be used for something
Also
And this isn’t nearly as relevant
Buzludzha is an amazing looking building
It’s space ship in the middle of the wilderness
The subterranean levels of the tomb are actually a fallout shelter with the additional infrastructure for preserving the museum's mummy
As the structure above is already destroyed for good, the fallout shelter was abandoned but preserved
Currently the municipality is turning it into a [mixed structure] with an art gallery and a historical museum
Yeah
But you should definitely destroy the ugly Lenin statues and create one big statue of the great Reagan in front of the Kremlin
After all it was him who destroyed the Empire of Evil
Just to remind you every day about the criminal and primitive regime that you had and the (literally) human cost of sustaining it - GULAGs, repressions and wars
The regime you couldn't take down yourself so that the Americans had to do it for you
I know the architect researcher who made the proposal
I haven’t heard that they are starting to work on it tho
This happens here as well but mostly at less known pubs where 90% of the customers are just people from the neighbourhood :D
All police here have pistols,  but it's quite rare to see someone with bigger gun like rifle or other weapon
Every cop is armed here
However I have never seen a police officer drawing their gun
I have never seen a real gun firing - I've seen gas pistols and firework guns fire tho
The Americas are two continents
Oceania is not a continent - Australia is and Oceania contains Australia, the Pacific islands and New Zealand
The Indonesian archipelago is considered as part of Asia
I was touth about North and South America,  Australia and Oceania
I don't know if it is changed in the current educational system
They taught us both geographical definition and topographic in the early 00s. Greenland is still Danish, but it is considered part of the North American landmass
We were taught that Australia encompasses Astralasia, Micronesia, Melanesia and Polynesia
In bulgarian I guess the only weird thing that I can think about besides double negatives, is that we describe forest with the word гора (Gora) and mountain with планина (planina) which kind of doesn't make sense when you think about it
In general slavic "gore" means up or heigh, so it makes sense it should be used for a mountain which is generally up
For whatever reason we saw that usually lots of forests are on mountains, so we started calling forests гори (plural)
But planina I have no idea where it came from
Sounds a little like the English word "plane" which just means the direct opposite of mountain
Similar, but not the same, Bulgarian такова (standalone it can be something like "like that")
It can be any par of the sentence and almost any part if speech
Most of the Khans and the Tsars
Basic stuff like:
* Asparuh - the Khan that founded Bulgaria
* Tervel - the Khan that saved Byzantium from the Arabs
* Krum - the Khan that made a drinking cup out of the Byzantine Emperor's head
* Boris - who converted Bulgaria to Christianity
* Simeon the Great - who commissioned the Cyrillic alphabet and almost captured Constantinople
* Vladimir Rasate - who tried to stop the Christianisation and Boris (his father) blinded him for it
* Samuil - the Tsar that died of a heart attack when he saw his 10000 soldiers returning from war blinded by the Byzantine Emperor Basil II Bulgarochtonos
* Boris III - who refused to extradite the Jews during World War II and most likely Hitler poisoned him for it
I've given four historical figures from three separate "eras" of Bulgarian history: Revival (before liberation); first Bulgarian kingdom/empire; modern Bulgarian state
I haven't included the second Bulgarian kingdom or anyone who participated in the many liberation movements and many of the people listed below can be switched with other equally known people
Vasil Levski,
Hristo Botev,
Goce Delchev,
Ivan Vazov,
Han Asparuh,
Han Krum,
Tsar Boris I,
Tsar Simeon the great
Tsar Ferdinand I,
Tsar Boris III,
Stefan Stambolov,
Todor Zhivkov
Also Vasil Levski, Hristo Botev, Georgi Rakovski, all of them were revolutionaries and Ivan Vazov, who is the most famous bulgarian writer
300+ wars with Byzantium and 4 with Greece since 681
I've read about multiple such cases in our Black Sea resorts, particularly Sunny Beach
Really sad but, after all, being so drunk is a choice
Definitely a thing in Bulgaria - well known cheap booze destination
I don't really like it tbh
We have a saying in Bulgaria "soup with grapes" meaning it's a bunch of different things that don't really work together and I think it applies to English
It's a Germanic language, where half the words are from Romance languages
I prefer Bulgarian because it isn't "soup with grapes" and I think this mainly comes from the fact that it has been perfected and revised for a lot longer than English
Bulgaria is experiencing it's second wave right now, we reached 10 000 cases (4689 active 5585 recovered) and 347 dead on Monday so people are kinda worried
The Ministry of Education said they are prepared to continue virtual schooling as long as possible but are operating under the assumption that schools will open up on 15th Sep as usual
The kindergartens were opened at the end of May, so parents have mixed feelings about the whole situation - at one hand, opening the kindergartens went well, on other hand - schools have less control over students than kindergartens over toddlers
I'm laughing so hard at this right now omg
Least problematic neighbors, better at fighting corruption than we are
Older stereotypes of course boil down to "hahaha, you have more gypsies than we do".
The simplest explanation is ignorant people, basically
The PC term for gypsies is Roma,so you can see where the misunderstanding may come from
Another reason is,when for example a pack of 300 gypsies moves to a German/English/French town to abuse welfare after which you get the local medias writing articles about that
The article will say "Bulgarians/Romanians doing X or Y"  and show pictures of gypsies and so that's where the association comes from
I don't blame the medias too much honestly,they are Bulgarian/Romanian citizens so I get why they're reporting it just like that,but imho people should know that they're **not ethnic Bulgarians/Romanians**. They live in a parallel society to ours and the only thing we share in common is the country
Count us in on that,Bromania
With so many young people migrating west, if that isn't true, it soon will be
Well, it's not in the same country for hundreds of years, it's in the same lands
And even though they don't have their own country,the stark ethnic differences between the gypsies and the ethnicity of the country they reside can't be glossed over
In Bulgarian it's чук (chuk) , I think its a somewhat hard quick word
Млатя (mlatya) means “to beat down” in Bulgarian
Wow  , chukan here it's a verb,  like "hammered " "knocked " , it could be "fucked " as well , depends on the context
I'm my country you'd be switching people without a job with people without a job so not much would change really
I had an italian friend and ever since I ate pasta at her house I can't eat it any other way
Most people here like it mushy though
Spelling bees are pointless in Bulgaria
Our language is like 97% phonetic and with the Cyrillic being created for it, makes differences between spelling and pronunciation rare
Since we write what we hear, when I was a kid and watched movies about spelling bees I was always baffled, because the idea is absurd for my own language experience
Spelling Bee finalist here
I was in 7th grade (13 y/o) when I decided to go to the spelling bee in my school
It was something not many people talked about and I wasn't that excited to go, but my english teacher basically told me "You're the best in your class/year, so you gotta". I won 2nd place, which means I went to regionals with the 1st place girl
A few months after we go to the regionals and it's comprised of two separate categories - the people who won first place go together and then the people who won second
The rounds were just spell a word from the list you've been given a few months prior
So one thing led to another and I won in my category (the girl from my school didn't win), so I was basically going alone to nationals
What I didn't know prior was that every national contestant is to go to a summer camp with volunteers, where we will basically have fun for free
(There were activities like baseball, baking, talent show, treasure hunt, etc)
During nationals there were three rounds - 1st round is spelling a word from the list, 2nd round is the judges giving you a word in bulgarian from the list and you need to translate and spell the word in english, 3rd round is unknown words from a separate list you don't receive
I have very fond memories of Spelling Bee, but it wasn't because of the competition, I just made a friend that is still one of my closest friends to this day (we went to high school together)
Apart from that, I was happy I did it because I got to be a mentee judge in high school and it was a really cool experience
Also we went to Hilton for free and my teacher still greets my dad on the street because of that
This is true if you speak Bulgarian "correctly". If you speak with a thick dialect and for some reason haven't listened to standard Bulgarian much, maybe it will be harder
Somewhat true
But as long as you attend school and watch TV, you'll be exposed to proper Bulgarian
We vote for parties and each party gets a proportial number of seats in parliament
However, Bulgarians mostly identify parties by their leader so it's not too different from a direct vote for a leader
And our parties are strongly hierarchical, so our PM can directly take control of any decision even when he doesn't have the jurisdiction to
No one even bats an eye
Our parents/grandparents badger us constantly about it, but realistically they know that things happen slower than they did in their time
My dad had 2 kids and his own home by 22, that's unfathomable to me from an economic standpoint, even now in my 30s.
Hey isn't it true that old Bulgarians live in Banat
Nazis
In Germany
Still
should the rest of us be worried
Solar highways, sacre blu what a stupid project that was xD
Interesting
It's just what it is: on Friday night you and friends get in the car and three hours later you're on the Greek shore, eating dinner in Thessaloniki
Sugar
Why
Surely sugar can't cost *that* much
In the US, a garbage disposal “In-Sink-Erator” is super common
Basically a motor connected to rotating blades down your sink drain that allows you to put food waste down the sink instead of putting it in the trash where it may start to smell
Maybe you see so few of these in Europe because of the different plumbing
In Bulgaria, many homes are still heated by a Petchka, wood burning stove
This is for oven cooking, has a few hobs on top and can also heat the entire house by heating water which is circulated to radiators using a pump
In my city we can't have a metro because every time they start digging they find something considered heritage and can't keep going
Even though we had mass protests this summer nothing will probably change in the upcoming election schedualed for march 2021, since if not for the ruling party the socialist(previous communist) party will be in control, something a lot of people don't trust
We have the same tradition called “koleduvane” so it’s likely a remnant of a pre-christian era
Sadly, today it’s pretty much dead in the cities and only lives on in some villages
I remember being a kid ~20 years ago and “koledari” coming to our village house and singing on Christmas eve
Fun fact, in Bulgaria we even call Christmas “Koleda”.
That’s easy
[Moya strana, moya Balgaria] by Emil Dimitrov (My land, my Bulgaria) is definitely like an unofficial anthem to Bulgaria
Everyone knows it, everyone gets patriotic and emotional whenever it plays
And even though it came out during the Communist years, when immigration was not really a thing, the lyrics talk about Bulgaria through the point of view of someone coming back - quite the heart-wrenching topic considering Bulgaria is the fastest shrinking country in the world and 30% of Bulgarians live abroad
The only other non-folklore song I can think of that may come close to that is [Edna balgarska roza] by Pasha Hristova (A Bulgarian rose)
The rose is the national symbol
As far as folklore songs go, those hold a special place in our popular culture and are the true mark of Bulgarian patriotism (to the point of stupidity, sometimes)
The most iconic one I can think of is [Koy ushi bayryaka] (Who sewed the flag)
The lyrics talk about [Rayna Knyaginya] an almost mythological figure from the late 19th century, a revolutional who sewed the flag that says “Liberty or death” for the April Uprising
We literally have a town called Златоград, or zlatograd which means "golden city". It's located in Bulgaria so I'll leave it up to you to guess whether there's any gold or wealth there
Sofia (our capital) is Greek for "wisdom", and given this is the place where our politicians reside I find this the last place I would attribute any descriptor for intelligence
Isnt the Royal form of Mann
As in just meaning "people"? If I'm not mistaken in old germanic both women and men were a form of man
For weoman remained women and whatever men had as a prefix was removed
Still can be seen well in the English language as in the mainland germanic languages you now have "frau or vrouw" for women
Maybe describes the population
Indeed
The devil lives in the Vatican
>The European Union is full of American military bases
The US has around 60 000 military personnel in Europe and there have been numerous proposals to decrease that number or remove all of them
>previous American leaders have always been very pro-European
You can't rely on the whims of the American public during their latest election to always be in Europe's best interest
That's madness
>The import tax rate is only 2
5% outside the EU, i.e. bread crumbs
All important taxes/tariffs have an effect, no matter how small
>The EU protecting is a joke and the Americans and the Chinese laugh when they hear that a strong EU will protect European markets
Yes, because the EU doesn't have the power to stop them unless the member states agree, and they won't when China and the US can bribe them individually
The only reason we're even in this mess is because people like you have been fighting against any integration and measures to increase the EU's power for years and now complain it's ineffective
The hypocrisy is just bewildering
July Morning
It started as a hippie thing opposing the socialist regime in the 60’s/70’s but it became widespread and is a very popular tradition to this day
On the night of 30 June, people gather at beaches (although those who don’t want to travel to the seaside go to the mountains, hills etc) and start bonfires, set up camps, party and sometimes famous people have concerts
At the end people watch the sun rise
It’s a very cool tradition
More info here:
Most foreign: either Kurdzhali (about 65% ethnic Turkish, right at the border with Greece) or Sofia (the richest, most western and progresive)
Most normal/ typical - any town in and around the Balkan mountains (Kazanlak, Koprivshtica, Gabrovo, etc
I must say, Sofia
I come from the seaside and I feel like the city is terribly mismanaged
Also no sea
Everything is written the way it's pronounced
That's a plus
We are the fastest dying population and nobody speaks our language
Big minus
For: it's Slavic and phonetic, meaning it will be easier to pick up for many countries
Against: it's never really spoken by the official standards, outside of the news on TV
Grammar is optional most of the time
Jokes on you our alphabet was based on yours ez pz lmn sqz
Also you can randomly rearrange the words in most sentences without losing any meaning
That's another minus
Grammar is rarely important
>You need a rational langage, so all southerns one are out
The fuck does that mean your language makes no sense
Roma Invicta
Our entire language has Greek origins so yano
Wait you can
Ayyy, you'll be able to join the club of 5 people and a cow
I don't know about grammar being easy
With being Bulgarian becoming rarer and rarer, you'll enjoy those perks even more as time goes on
Yes but you'd do it angrily
It's okay, English with a German accent is also very sexy
Че може, аз не знаех.
They said without problematic history
Честно казано то тва и в английския работи пък и не виждам как е минус.
"That you can do that, I did not know"
Idk I haven't heard anything about Czech being hard or Bulgarian being easy
The only impression I have of Czech is that it makes women sound very sexy, but that might just be because of the context I've heard it in
Tell me about it
I didn't want a slavic accent so I learnt English from my babysitter at the time (foreigner, native speaker) only to realise, wait, slavic accents sound kinda scary, I wanna be scary
Sad gamer hours
Mention North Macedonia and she'll get scary, trust me
Getting greedy for land after the first balkan war and thinking we can take on all our neighbours
We lost everything in the second balkan war because of it
As (to my knowledge) it isn't finalised yet, what do you think the reprecussions are going to be
I don't know man, given serbias history with their neighbours I'm not sure they should talk about backstabbing
But I will agree that we were greedy and should have put diplomacy above some useless lands and quick profit
Yep, same here
First mention of the Bulgars is somewhere in the 430s. There's like 50 theories on the stuff before that
The Thracian link is also pretty hazy in places
[Chelsea] logo always looks noble to me
Officially, as we like to call Ruse "the little Vienna", it should be Johann Strauss' Vienna Waltz
Unofficially, it would be some classic chalga song like the infamous "A white Mercedes chases me in life". It can be heard often enough on our streets, so it's already something of a backing track here
We have the friendliest angry people of Europe
I think we could be useful militarily
Today i read about it and how it probably derives from when we were enslaved
It was something about the idea of confusing the Turks so that they won't know when we say yes and when no
I have never actually been inside the Boyana church
But have you been to SFRJ Club Vienna
Granted that it's not the same thing but I've been to Belgrade a few times and I've never been to New Belgrade
Maybe once but it's like we just crossed a bridge said "yay we are out of the Balkans" and went to the old part of Belgrade again
Education, it will be almost impossible for you NOT to get a job, but you'll have to find a private school to teach at if you actually want money
All but "too much rice" and "half-dose" are usual in Bulgaria
Also a bit of garlic with the onion for rice
Never been in Bulgaria
Inside smoking has been banned for years and yet at least half of the places will allow it
In Bulgarian, if you are asked an obvious question you can answer by doubling the opposite of the answer, usually with some interjection
'Eh, Yes - yes' means 'No, obviously' and 'Eh, No - no' means 'Yes, obviously' (I am not sure about what punctuation to put between the doubling, but is is definitely not a comma)
Nobody mentions Bulgaria
Look at OPs question again
Who thinks Turkey is innocent
I mean our king was German so it makes sense to be fair
Plus we refused them soldiers for attacking Russia and we refused them any of our Jews
Plus they promised us our lands back so it makes sense we couldn't really complain about Germans taking the Jews from those lands
No, as far as I know we don't have autonomous regions
No - by Constitution we are a unitary state and autonomous regions within Bulgaria are impossible
Prolly [Alexander Nevsky Cathedral] for Bulgaria
I would have said [Alexander Nevsky Cathedral]
or that bridge with the dragons
e: shit that's not a building
I was in Chernobyl last August, one of the best moments of my life
Radiation levels are ''OK'' at most of the places in Pripyat, except near the Hospital or the Red forest
The guide told us not to step on moss as the moss contains the most radiation
Chernobyl itself (the villiage) was super chill compared to Pripyat, we even had an ice cream in the local babushka store
Birmingham, although it's not a tourist place at all but it's a very industrial city that I'd rather not visit again
Brussels, Skopje and Bucharest are also up there - sorry, my fellow neighbors
Outside of Europe I'd say Los Angeles disappointed me the most
For me it was Brussels
I really didn't like it
But I'm willing to try it again one day
I can't really judge it on just one day
Yes, I was visiting some friends
The one and only reason I went there
Way too much traffic and public transport is almost non-existent
I had to either walk a lot or spend a lot of money on Uber to get around
I've done that a few times (in different bars) and there was no reaction, the barman was just " here you go boys, have fun" . So , I don't think there will be a different  reaction than this .
Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Persia, Greece, Rome
That's about it
And of course Thracians
Here History is just one subject (aka we don't have World History), so it's pretty hard to cover a lot of cultures
The few we do are covered pretty deeply, though
When I was in school, we studied Ancient Cultures in 7th grade
During the first semester we studied the civilisations from Mesopotamia (so Sumer, Akkadia, Babylonia, Assyria, Hittite, Phonecians) and Ancient Egypt
During the second semester we studied Ancient Thrace/Dacia, Ancient Greece (or well, the Minoans, Ionians, then followed by the various Greek city-states such as Sparta or Athena), Macedonia under Alexander the Okay and its fall, and Ancient Rome and its fall
We also had talked about the Persians but I don't remember when we studied them
It might have been one lesson, or mostly in relation to the Greco-Persian wars or Alexander the Fine Lad conquering them
We learnt a bit about the tribes that ransacked Rome but less about their history and more about the ransacking
So although we say, studied the Huns, it was mostly in relation to Rome
Outside of the "the Bulgars were the Huns" theory
In 9th grade we continued with Medieval history, and that was very Europe centric, ignoring the Ottoman Empire
Otherwise, in Geography we studied different religions
I remember making a project on Shintoism when we studied Asia
But granted, it's only for modern surviving cultures
(And is probably a disservice to countries like China that was influenced by Taoism, Buddhism and Confucianism)
And even then, Ancient Mesopotamian, Egyptian, Greek and Roman religions were studied much more in comparison
I'm going to be terribly clever and say that H in Cyrillic is a normal N [n] sound
Press your tongue to the roof of your mount and make a (slightly nasal) sound
I was hoping to be the first Cyrillic-bro to answer and confuse them, but you beat me
Bit more disclaimer for Latin-based speakers - in Cyrillic we use same-written "H" character for our ["En" letter] not like you for [/ˈeɪtʃ/] .  Also our equivalent h/ch/kh sound is for the [Х letter] (which amusingly is again used differently from Latin, because Cyrillic [originates from Greek script mostly]
I would visit them all
I'm curious, which are those countries that you feel would instigate an international scandal because a low-level employee wanted a bribe
Ehm, no
EU citizens travel freely without a visa to all countries in green on this map:
This map states that all the countries in green do not require a visa for EU citizens
The UK is lumped with the EU and EFTA, because until the 31
2020, free movement of people between those three still exists
Depending on the outcome of the deal, the EU may lose its free movement priviliges with the UK (and vice versa), therefore some kind of a visa would be required for EU citizens to go into the UK
That means there will be a difference between how EU citizens visit the UK and how they visit the countries in green
I shared the map because you said that surely visiting the UK in the future will be the same as visiting the non-EU countries and it would just require a visitor visa
It won't be the same, as non-EU countries currently don't require any kind of visa
We have a couple of very colourful expressions
We say in it's mother's (or ant) pussy or in geography's ass
In Bulgaria, specifically plovdiv, we say "на майната" (na mainata) which probably has some weird etymology
It means something like go to fuck yourself but it's used to refer to some distant place where one has no business
We say "at its mother's pussy"
Bjørk
I honestly don't know
Some years ago there was this case where a guy opened fire on another guy
The shooter claimed self-defence but he was convicted for attempt at murder regarless
The general rule is you need to respeond with the same level of aggression, which is insane
So, supposedly, if you're attacked with a knife and you shoot, you're not self-defending
Although - very few people have guns here anyway
Such a personal union has certainly been proposed before, although I'm not sure if it ever happened
The only good monarchs are dead monarchs
My home town Dolna Banya (Down/Bottom Bathroom ) have 5 mineral water springs,  one of which was used in the roman bathhouse , after which the town is named
I don't know for my current city, but the name of the city I where I was born and raised translates to loud/noisy
Not even some old forgotten word that means that, it's our modern day word for it
Lower Bathhouse would be a better translation
They go мър-мър, verb: мъркам (мър - muh-R, like the u in umbrella)
As far as I know one of the conditions of getting into the EU is that the country HAS to adopt the euro at a certain point (that point being fulfilling five(?) major rules)
But before that it would be a catastrophy for the country's economy
Some countries deliberately don't fulfil some of the requirement in order not to adopt the euro (Sweden)
The only state I know of getting around this rule even though they are eligible for the currency is Denmark
EDIT: TIL UK as well (thanks kind strangers), however Danish kroner are pegged to the Euro via ERM II
Switching to the euro now would annihilate the entire Bulgarian economy
It would be a catastrophe
Bulgaria doesn't have any dumplings
Can't think of anything like that in our cuisine
I don't think we have anything close to dumplings
Closest I can think of is banitsa, but it's more like a dish, than small serving portions
You use doughy sheets (like with baklava) and wrap a mixture of cheese, milk and eggs
EU one, thank you
Never heard of it, I don’t think there is a Bulgarian version
Edit: found one, but it’s definitely a recent forced translation of the English one
It’s definitely not part of the classic children’s songs here
Same objects, but different order: Rock, Scissors, Paper
Not all of Southern Europe has low unemployment
Bulgaria has had a 4-6% unemployment rate in the last 20 years or so and it's because we have a semi-decent mixed economy and we've stayed away from full on Keynesean madness, unlike Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece who all just loved to borrow and borrow
With the above I am simply answering the question
Of course our living standards are below all the other mentioned southern countries and of course we have a lot of "working poor" people who can barely afford food & rent despite spending 40 hours per week at a job
Things are improving, though, and people are rising to the middle class as of late so let's see for how long we'll be lagging behind still
No Soviet-Bloc country was ever independent
I said Soviet-Bloc, Yugoslavia was not a part of that
If they get citizenship
It's really not that hard in Bulgaria
Depends if they intend to stay for the time the elected officials are in office
I'd say i can easily communicate with Macedonians, Serbs, Croats and maybe Ukrainians (if we really try)
I'd manage in romance language countries (not you though France) if they speak very slowly
Slavic countries would be more or less easy to manage (not you though Poland)
You'll manage in Bulgaria as well
You'd manage more or less with Russians as well
How does a Dutch guy learn Bulgarian
Bulgarian gf or something
That's interesting, because I'm a Bulgarian, I speak Italian and I passed a Spanish test having never studied Spanish in my whole life
It said I should bypass levels A1-A2 and should begin a course for B1
I've never been to Spain, never spoken/read/heard Spanish and I've seen Spanish only on TV for like a bit, a couple of phrases or something like that
For an outside learner it is really close to Italian, trust me
The nuances native speakers can see in the languages are something non-native speakers can't see until much later on
When I did my Erasmus in Milano, the only people in the advanced course for Italian, outside of people who had studied it before, were Spanish students
They went to the language test and it placed them in the C1 course immediately
They struggled more than the others, of course, but they definitely caught up way faster than is normal
Ah that's nice man
It's a nice country for vacations
Especially with that fat Dutch money :P
[In Bruges (2008)]
Great movie
"Fuck off Ken, they're filming midgets"
Waffles,European Parliament,Atomium

North Macedonia mostly
Macedonia
They are the Bulgarian Belgium
Tell me some about the Bulgarians :P
I thought Germans don't make jokes ;)
21-22C - Thermostat is set at 22C, but don't think it's uniform around the whole room
I usually keep it around 20-ish during the day, because sun makes me feel warmer, even though it's still around 20C inside actually
16-17C and lower is a cold room for me
If it's 18C I'm still pretty much ok (I am a hot-blooded guy though), just put on a thin fleece jacket or something
But lower than that I just can't keep my hands and feet warm (which is funny because I'm usually ok at 13-14-15 outside, as movement keeps me warm there)
This thread reminds me I should buy a room thermometer
Anyway since I don't feel cold or hot it must be between 23 and 27°C. That's my most comfortable range
My dad, however prefers 17-21°. I don't understand it
If they joined, they'd get voting rights on the rules they have to follow anyway
If they stay out, they don't have to participate in the common fisheries policy
The Norwegians decided that the strength of their fishing industry is more important than having voting rights, so they stay out
Once/if this ever changes, they should'nt have too many troubles getting in
If norway ever stops doing well without the EU, it's always welcome to join in my opinion
Until then I see them as friends and European brethren
That's what's so odd about brexit, they not only want to leave the EU but also make it sound as if they don't want to be a part of the continent in cultural terms
Wow, is that really the entire country of norway
About a third of your population does want to get in
As for what the point is, I've just stated it, voting rights on the rules you have to follow
Kindly refrain from twisting 'the cons outweigh to pros' into 'there are no pros', cheers
Even if you were dirt poor and the EU was doing fine
Lol yeah right
Thx Mr president of Norway
It's slowly getting better
In an ever steady incline since we were robbed blind by our own politicians during the change
The slope of the incline is so low because our politicians are still corrupt as hell
Oh well
As a young man, I've got no problem walking around most of my city alone at night (with the exception of certain neighbourhoods, going through which even in brought daylight is considered a bit adventurous)
Of course, my female friends have it a bit tougher
Most of them would only go out past dark if another person is accompanying them, preferably a man, but certainly not alone
In 2016 we made a survey with some 6000 respondents about night life in Sofia
The most popular reason to be worried about your safety reported were: being dark and tripping over something you didn’t see and homeless dogs
So, I imagine most people feel safe here, which is nice
The authors Bulgaria would consider its most significant like Hristo Botev and Ivan Vazov have at this point been dead for so long that their work is most likely in the Public domain
I could be wrong though
The word към in Bulgarian means towards and it is pronounced just like the English 'cum'. Also той (pronounced 'toy') means he
That
doesn't work very well when you have a different alphabet
Just respect the local culture
For example, if visiting a monastery in Greece, don't wear shorts or take one of the cloaks they offer
I've actually had positive experiences with Americans and there was only one case of a very annoying guy, who, after the landing of the plane, stated screaming "Hallelujah" and "Thank the Almighty God" and then wanted that everybody sing with him some sort of gospel song
Well, nobody was particularly fond of him and he was disappointed, because in the US he would have been (supposedly) applauded for this talent
Just don't do those kind of things
Stay away from the cycling lanes, if you go *anywhere in Europe*  (unless you are riding a bike)
We're still trying to teach these magic powers to some of the locals here, no need for tourists to join in
Tarator = Bulgarian summer soup
&#x200B;
Tzatziki = Greek salad
I'm Dutch in Bulgaria and it was really bizarre for me to get used to this Bulgarian thing where people are almost fighting each other to be the most noble person
It's ridiculous
Some have it worse than others, but I've seen it almost devolve beyond yelling at each other in public
So you go out together, have a drink and a meal in a restaurant and then when the time comes to pay the bill you'd better brace yourself because blood will be drawn before someone let's you pay
It's kind of annoying because it becomes a whole thing to do something nice for someone there
I think they're just very proud people or something
It's funny because I as a Dutch guy don't care who pays, I'm used to splitting the bill anyways
I did get into trouble with a friend once over this passiveness of mine
We went out to a amusement park and this friend of mine told me I should pay the tickets because this other friend of mine wasn't that rich
I had paid a bunch of stuff for all of us before that so I assumed my "debt" had been sufficiently paid
Regardless, we arrive at the entrance and I walked up to pay
However that poor friend sped up and reached the desk before me and already had money on his hands and already ordered the tickets
I was like lol OK
Turns out, and I actually got into a fight over this, I should have somehow forced myself in front of him and taken the money out of the cashiers hands and replaced it with my own money, and then argued about it with him in public like a bunch of lunatics
This was a big thing for me to get used to in Bulgaria
I was visiting my girlfriend's family in Malta for the first time last year, and I was surprised to see people living in houses keeping the front door opened
at all times, even during the evening
Oh, and they are extremely religious, especially the older generations
Oh and to add to Dutch/Bulgarian differences, I'm having difficulty matching the eating speed of Bulgarians
They eat really slow in the evenings and will stay at restaurants until past midnight eating cold food
I try to match it but I'm always too hungry, so I will usually have finished my meal a long time ago
To be fair I like the Bulgarian way of dinner far better than the soulless "eat and get out" style of the Dutch
OMG yes,you made my day, thank you
> Not using clacson
This is the first time I see this word used in English
I swear it's so fucking weird seeing it like this
Which stereotype about Europe do you hate
That Europe = Britain
I like how you didn't even mebtion the whole of the Netherlands, just Amsterdam
Painfully accurate though
Everyone being rich, cultured/rude, racist and probably more I've heard
Interesting
I've always heard it the other way around
Bulgarians are considered gypsies too sometimes, I get you
You know corruscant from star wars
those scebes were shot in amstherlamds, the whole coubtry is just one megapolis
A mansion the size of the Buckingham palace
I live in Ruse, my country's 5th largest city
Here in Sofia
- A large 150sqm flat in the most expensive areas - [example]
- A 403sqm house in the suburbs - [example]
- Four one-bedrooms (~70sqm) in an average area - [example]
- Six one-bedrooms (~70sqm) in a poor area - [example]
It's really confusing
We have it both ways, haha
The floor above the ground floor if the building has stores on the ground floor, otherwise - the very first floor above the ground
Houses follow the same rule
Same here
The ground floor is ,,партер" (parter) and then the one above is ,,Първи етаж" (1st etage - pronounced as in french)
Let's see
Bulgaria invented the Cyrillic alphabet used in a big part of the world
We're also proud that the inventor of the first digital computer is John Atanassov, with Bulgarian descend
Also the airbags in the cars (which saved a lot of lives) and the first aerial bombardment
which didn't save a lot of lives
The first digital electronic computer
The oral contraceptive pill
The cyrillic alphabet
Contributions for the creation of one of the first digital wristwatches
Yoghurt (not the Greek variation, although similar)
No, Santa lives in Lappland which is a region located within three countries(if I am not mistaken) - Finland, Sweden and a small part in Norway
In Bulgaria people put mustard/ketchup/mayo all over their pizza before eating
Dipping garlic sauce does not really exist, or if we do, we put it on the top of the pizza
Pro: really cheap
Both living and property
If you're a EU retiree, you can live like a king here just from your pension alone
Con: language barrier, low standard of living outside of big cities
Cons: low standard of living, bad government,the peoples are toxic af
Pros: I cant remember any pros in living in Bulgaria nowadays
We had beautiful nature but we are destroying it fast, We had great education but we dont have it anymore .But at least we have 1300 years of history at least so we can remember about the lost Bulgaria
Pros: Beautiful nature
Cons: Very incompetent politicians, Corruption, Extremely low wages, high taxes, a lot of iliterate people who can be very aggressive, Not a lot of historical places and such(because during our 500 year long ottoman rule we were slaughtered our houses burned etc
) Very very polluten
Conclusion: The country is in a serious crysis right now
Sorry for bad english also
Pros: Nice weather, amazing nature, nice beaches, rich culture and nice food
Cons: Low wages, corruption and the streets are awful
Not to mention the pollution in some of the bigger cities
Most of the problems will disappear if our politicians disappear
They really are
Sofia's GDP per capita PPP is already on par with France
The same stat for small cities is on par with Namibia
The villages are even worse
The Romanian national anthem
There is even a fantastic [Lebanese] version of it
It's a great song
Bulgaria isn't transcontinental, we are pure mongol
I watched documentary film about this
Rose jam
Sure, smells nice (to some, for me it's like eating soap) and if you like it then maybe you have a forgotten jar at the back of your cupboards
But there are so many great jams out there so why buy the more expensive novelty one
Not to mention a lot of people make their own and good luck with tryna make a rose jam
And most importantly, even if you wanted to have it a lot - you can't! Eat too much and it will give you the shits
If you're eating something sweet and you dont share it with someone who wants some
Their dick falls off
What folders
Just toss that shit into the backpack and search for it the first 15 minutes of each class
Holy fuck, that's beyond creepy, extreme only begins to describe it
How is this possible in the capital of country in the heart of EU
Is there no police there
Some dodgy neighborhood
Don't want to trigger people, but curiosity begs - what kind of people are we talking about - recent immigrants
I can't imagine anyone else being so out-of-touch with societal norms and culture, but I haven't been in France so I might be missing something
Here its dark in 17:40 ~ 17:50 and we are almost on the frikin Mediterranean
So, sadly, seems part of the culture in some circles there
Weird, I've been to other big capitals, always seemed enough police in central zones (probably due to counter-terrorism) to deter any bullshit
I'm keeping notes for a potential vacation :P
For us as a region the Rhodopes, for the city I'd say plovdiv
I'd say Plovdiv
Plovdiv, maybe
English
I want other people to be able to read and understand the code too
In my country (Bulgaria) they sell good things with good quality, and it looks like they are going not for the big countries but for the medium type of countries,  that don't have very good economy and at the same time they don't have the worst
Lidl has different strategies for east and west
In Bulgaria they have huge nice good quality stores whereas in the Netherlands they actually are small and they are marketing to poor people or people on a budget
A mixture of ало or да.
If I’m tired I may accidentally answer the phone like that in English also
There’s a certain portion of Bulgarian society that may answer with кой, which is who
I’d say it feels closer to answering the phone by saying what
If that happens it usually a sign you’re in for a more amusing and or frustrating call
It’s well fairly rude and unprofessional though I’ve heard it used by a government service before
It was founded for the first time in 681
So if you don't count the two centuries it was part of the Roman Empire and the five centuries it was part of the Ottoman Empire, Bulgaria has existed for 1339 years
>part of the Roman Empire
Uhm
You mean the Byzantine empire
Byzantine Empire = Eastern Roman Empire
Delivery or if in Sofia (the capital), you can take one of the cargo Sparks - [electric trucks] for rent
There are also hamali (movers) - firms, specialised in moving heavy stuff
They employ young guys, they come with their own truck, they carry your stuff, load it, move it and unload it
Nobody uses drywall, but I get the question
You fold down the backseats and see if it fits if it doesn't you drive with you boot open
How you may ask, we'll get some straps and tie everything down as much as you can to try and keep it in your car
Yes, we cooked an egg omelet once
Like many of the people who comment I'd say that speaking the language should be a requirement for citizenship
Not because I think that my national language is the best in word or our of some nationalist sentiments
No, it is because if you want to be a citizen, this carries some rights and obligations
And to be a fullfledged member of the society you need to speak the language on a decent level
Administrative work, voting, and being able to familiarise yourself with and obeying the laws are some serious points in my book
And in my country, you won't have an easy time if you do not speak Bulgarian
Your book
I'm gonna need a name :)
That's a figure of speech
I haven't really written a book
Ooh
Hever heard it before but hey learnt something new
:D Almost thought someone had actually written a book about migration in Bulgaria
Haha, sounds too good to be true
10 min walk + 15 min by tram or about 20 min by bike
A third option will be made available to me in May, when the third line of our metro opens, which will be 5 min walk + 10 min by metro
About 30 - 40 minutes by a nasty, smelly tram, or close to 1h 30 minutes by walk
Too cold for walks still :(
15 - 30 minutes by car in city traffic
Sometimes more or if I leave at 17 30
Don't put your hopes on the metro, so you'll be surprised if it actually opens on the new deadline
It will open *at some point*.
I know Dutch people who moved out in their early teens 16ish
I also know Dutch people who pay rent to their parents since their 14s. Meanwhile in Bulgaria 30 and still with your parents is relatively common
Wearing tracksuits
Gypsies
Fun fact: that Russian alphabet
We invented it
fun fact: it's true, read more ya greekz
It literally is though
100% fact
Not the current official Russian alphabet as it is now ofcourse but the general cyrillic alphabet was invented by the Bulgarian literary schools based on the preceding glagolitic alphabet invented by Cyril and Methodius and symbols commonly used in the Greek alphabet
Hey you're right in one thing
Cyril and methodius were from thessaloniki which was not Bulgarian at that time
However, they did not invent the cyrillic alphabet but the glagolitic alphabet
Don't worry, it's a common misconception
If you're saying the cyrillic alphabet was inspired by the glagolitic alphabet because that's the alphabet the Bulgarian literary schools were working with before, then yeah sure
Still makes it Bulgarian though otherwise the Greek or Latin alphabet doesn't exist either :P
Try the Rhodopes if you're into nature hiking and stuff, it's fantastic
Really depends on what kind of stuff you're into
You could check out the St George rotund Church if you're interested in your own Greek history
Otherwise there's vitosha if you're into hiking
Boulevard vitosha is great for shopping
If you're looking for alternatives to Sofia I'd advise veliko turnovo and plovdiv
I'd rather not tell you cause no matter what I say greeks and turks under my comment will argue whether Greeks or Turks made it even though I'm talking about the Bulgarian version
[Garash cake] and its walnut deliciousness
I am sorry but Lol
That Khan Krum destroyed all vineyards
The people who believe that also believe he used Emperor Nikephoros' skull as
wait for it
a drinking cup
I guess they think that he drank only lemonade from it, no alcohol whatsoever
Also that Saints Cyril and Methodius were Bulgarians who invented the Cyrillic alphabet
Neither of these things is true
Very common in Bulgarian towns and villages, less common in cities
Woohoo, we are pretty proud of our empire
But the thing is that it was one thousand years ago, so it's not a political matter in present times
But yeah, we're pretty proud
We also have a "meme" kinda phrase - "Bulgaria on three seas
" Sometimes to joke with the nationalists, sometimes like a nostalgia in a funny context
Even if not empire, Finland is awesome on so many levels
For us Finland is saunas and Simo
Fuck yeah
Hokkaido is my city
Possibly Volen Siderov - he's the leader of a far-right party (ATAKA) who's agenda is very hate-based, and his hobbies include getting into fights with university students
He's a fucking joke, as are most of the pathetic neo-nazis in his circle
They appeal mostly to nationalists, who often overlap with football hooligans
That whole thing is a can of worms but the guy is not taken seriously by a lot of people, even his mannerisms and general behaviour/speech is ridiculous
That being said, our Prime Minister Boyko Borisov isn't the most popular among people and his public image (as a man of the people, for lack of a better term) has mixed reception - mostly positive, perhaps, at least for the "uneducated masses". As for the people who are strongly opposed to him - he's a good focal point of a lot (dare say - all) of the corruption within our political and judicial system, but I can't call the people preaching for other politicians more educated - just *sick of his shit*. We hate all our politicians though
It's Delyan Peevski
In 2013, when he was announced to lead the "Bulgarian FBI", DANS, tens of thousands of people protested for months
He appoints the General Prosecutor by a fake vote from the High Judicial Council
He controls the prosecution and a large amount of the judges
He controls the Prime Minister Boyko Borissov, receiving millions of euros in official state and European funding programmes
He controls most of the media outlets in the country, one of which is the most watched television, Nova TV
Bulgaria is #111 in the Freedom of Speech index
Last in Europe
In 2013 the 4th biggest bank in the country was forcefully bankrupted by the state under his command, so that he wouldn't have to return his loans and he would be able to steal the bank's assets
The prosecution "couldn't find" a link between him and the bank
He is the face of the state mafia and the country is going straight to a shit hole because of it
Cheap labour and a place to have your company if you don't like a lot of taxes
Bulgarian communist party secretary intended to make Bulgaria the 16th republic of the Soviet Union, the plenum unanimously approved Todor Zhivkov's proposal
If that happened Bulgaria would have been the first country voluntarily joining to the USSR
So it think that the period 1944 - 1989 is full of such betrayals
Our judicial system says that the General Prosecutor of the country is to be elected for a seven-year period by high-standing judicial people like judges and e.t.c There was only one candidate and he is "morally flawed". He was "elected", but our president put a veto on his "election". They did another "election" and he was once again "elected". The democratic choice of the only candidate
There are protest now against that and people want a new procedure with more candidates
Used to be 30%,  more like 1
5% now but culture remains very heavily influenced
Before WWII the name was Министерство на войната (Ministerstvo na voynata) or "Ministry of War". After WWII, it was renamed to Министерство на отбраната (Ministerstvo na otbranata) or "Ministry of Defense".
I know that during monarchist times it was named "Ministry of War" however at some point between 1944 and now it's changed to "Ministry of Defence"
Let's hope so
I like liberal societies which protect their citizen's civil rights and freedoms
Also I prefer a president that looks like a business executive over a mafia hit man
I hate [Moussaka] and [Shkembe Chorba]
Тъмна Индия ми е. - "That's dark India to me
" - extremely foreign, unfamiliar
Развод по италиански. -"Divorce the italian way
" - signifies that the only break up in the situation is death of one party
Френска любов. - "French love
" - oral sex
Седя по турски. - "Sitting the turkish way
" - sitting on the floor in a lotus position
But by far the most popular are:
Лъжа като дърт циганин. - "To lie like an old gypsy
" To lie naturally, often and with no remorse
Оглеждам се като обран евреин. - "To look around like a robbed jew
" - to be standing around and looking around, optionally with suspicion, and not doing anything
And most Slavic languages refer to Germans as "nemtzi" and other variants of that
A literal translation could be "mute
" It comes from labelling their language as "gibberish" centuries ago, and it just stuck, transcending borders between us
> I don't think these negative comments are because of racism but bc of their behavior as a collective
Yeeees
Thank you for this
It's not some "white power,people with darker skin are inferior" thing
It's a "my only interactions and experiences with them were bad" thing
Also political correctness is not a thing here
You can't expect me to not speak my mind and act like everything is all roses and sparkles so that I don't upset someone
> And if that is the case, we should find a way that does not hurt people so everyone can enjoy the holiday
You can never appease anyone, unfortunately
It's a Dutch tradition and you guys are entitled to it,American SJW's be damned
I really don't like this trend of American political correctness being exported to Europe
I'm not advocating to be an asshole,but there should be a line to political correctness,often it's too much for my tastes
This one about [Bulgaria] is really well made , I've watched it a couple of times and everything in it is pretty accurate
Especially since it was the local Romanian and Bulgarian populace that was the subject
Good engineering
Have faith brother, it was the same in Bulgaria but people really started oppening up to Board Games in recent years
Still DnD and Warhammer are not that popular, but now you can at least explain the concept and people will start to understand you
I'm sure that its going to be the same for Croatia soon too
Same here
Eat so much fast food
I can only think of this [one]
I want the commission president to be elected directly
We learn about it in Bulgaria, but not in huge detail, of course
Maybe a page of the history book and 10 minutes of a lesson would be dedicated to it
Wait, did you not study Geography
We had to learn where every country in the world is, what its capital is and some basic facts, including climate and exports
Of course, most teachers in most schools don't bother making kids learn the countries and capitals in Africa or Oceania for example (Bulgaria is poor, our teachers are paid low wages), but in Europe
We needed to know everything important about every country
Yeah
If that's how it is in rich and powerful countries, no wonder a lot of people there think very highly of themselves
And considering it's a lot worse in the USA, I get now the millions of people parroting how their country is the only important one, the greatest in the world and so forth
> that French history is already so rich and complex that we just don’t have time to study the History of countries
This is EXTREMELY not true and if that's the case in France, you are in a bad need of education reform
Exactly
I've studied a lot about European countries - geography, history, culture, etc
, I've been to a lot of them, of course
And I feel close to these countries - when somebody says he's European I don't immediately think he's a foreigner, like I would for an American or a Japanese
My first thought is "he's like me, he's European".
Jesus
How is Bulgaria better than France in education
I my country wasn't in the Soviet Union, but it was in the Eastern Block
And I have never seen a real cockroach in my life
But I heard my parents talking about how many there were before
Considering not much ancient architecture survived, but modern one is either nice small scale, derivative middle or fugly-Communist big-scale, my best guesses are some of the old-but-not-ancient architecture examples:
[Rila Monastery]
Some of the old architecture reserve towns like:
Koprivshtitsa: [1] [2]
[Tryavna]
[Zheravna]
[Kovachevitsa]
Thus the birth of one of the funniest memes I have ever seen - the Chinese woman shouting "This is killing
" And the added picture of a goat underneath her (killing in Swedish means the child of a goat or something like that)
It's actually a joke I came across sometime ago, but also disturbingly true
You're not a Bulgarian if you don't have:
A plastic bag full of plastic bags
A 2l bottle of Coca Cola full of Rakia
An ice cream box  full of [sarmi] in the fridge
Well, when it raged, half of Europe was isolated behind the Iron curtain which limited travel and therefor slowed the spread there, but then again, once it got through the curtain, the lack of information and awareness made it spread faster
Bulgaria registered its first case in 1986 and up to this day we have 3173 cases
The authorities are allocating funds for prevention and control, the confirmed cases have access to antiretroviral therapy but still on last estimate 95% of the confirmed cases are on it
Wut, I didn't know that
I know there is a strong campaign in Bulgaria about prevention
But is this therapy free for thr inflected or they have to pay for it
Therapy is covered by the state
If you are a confirmed case, you are sent to a specialist and you are asigned checkup schedule, treatment plan etc
Your contacts are also given to foundations and social groups, dealing with HIV+ people, that provide psychological help to deal with the shock and fear
The National Refference Laboratory works with HIV/AIDS cases and each patient that goes there to be tested can talk to a psycologist on sight
Every haematology cabinet, gynecologist practice, GP and sexology practice has brouchures and information about it
I know all this because two years ago I went to have myself tested and the test came out possitive, so I went through hell for two months before the refference laboratory confirmed my negative status with the ELISA and the WB tests
So, yeah
get yourselves tested, people
Wtf
Why did it come out positive in the first place
And after that negative
Doesn't it make more sense the first tries not to detect it and after that to detect it when the virus has spread more
How can you detect something which is not physically there
I'm confused
The quick blood tests that most laboratories use are hypersensitive, so they often result in a "false positive". They are designed like this to make sure that they will catch even the slighest infections, but when they missfire on a negative person, they tend to scare them a lot
Ah, ok, that makes sense
Italian
I love Swedish
I get excited when I hear it every single time and I don't know why
Vad spännande
I don't care about insults about any country including my own
But if you make a wrong one get ready for a debate boyo lol
Not as many Russians as it used to be tbh
Though the number might be the same but many other nationalities started vacationing here so the Russians are not as noticeable
But yeah pretty much correct
We joke about Brexit you should not feel bad joking about our government lol
Well, first of all my father's name translated to "Wolf", so everyone, especially his coworkers, used to call me "the wolf cub". My parents also called me "bear cub" and later I was very impressed with some documentary about deer and I'd walk around roaring like a stag, so mom still calls me "stag".
Yess
That is not explainable but for some reason when I hear it makes sense
No idea how
Thankfully it didn't happen much but my dad sure called me "dad" a lot
Yea , exactly,  especially dad calls me "тате" (tate) all the time , mom , not so often but still calls me mom .
It comes from a possessive form, like "maminoto" (mommy's [kid])
I've heard almost every kind of relative call a kid affectionately by their own
degree of relation to them: mom, dad, aunt, uncle, grandma, grandpa, big sis
Big brothers have been an exception, strangely enough
Also can apply to pets
My aunt used to call her cat "mamo".
u/Acctforlnsub below says it's called inverse vocative
It originated as "mom's kid" or something
It didn't happen a lot that my mother called me "mom".
Idk, here "bate" or "batko" ("big bro") is used as "bro". Like, *puts on glasses* informal communication between two young to middle-aged males of similar social standing
Yeah, monsters go to Russia and get depressed
In Bulgarian, there are rules that determine the gender of the word
All words ending in -a are feminine, all ending in -o or -e are neuter and the rest are masculine
The only exception I  in the word for grandfather - дядо - it ends in -o but is treated as masculine
There's never confusion about the gender of a word for that reason, so we know what article to use
There's some confusion when it comes to 'the' - in Bulgarian, that is added to the end of a word
For masculine words, there are 4 different versions of the - 'a', 'ът/ut', 'я/ya' and 'ят/yat'. Which one you use depends on the role of the word in the sentence (if it's the subject, you use the versions ending in t) and of the word itself
People usually confuse when to use a subject 'the' and when to use a non-subject 'the', but it doesn't depend on if the word is new or not
Bulgarian is actually an exception as it's a Slavic language and we use articles as well but we have no case system, only remnants of it (there used to be one but it was abolished some time ago)
That's why I find it difficult to wrap my head around the concept of cases and even more so the absence of articles
One I hate: that we're all sly, stealing gypsies that go around Europe to basically cheat the system over and over again
No work ethic whatsoever
One I enjoy: that the women are gorgeous
I completely agree, in school I was in a class with 24 girls for 12 years of my life
Six of my classmates won beauty pageants
They were and still are absolutely beautiful
funny thing is, most people here see the backstabbing incident as you (Serbs) being greedy for territory during the first war, while we were the ones actually fighting the Turks, so a Bulgarian stereotype about Serbs is an imperialistic dream that never comes true
But that's just kinda how nationalism works
In Bulgaria, no doubt [Vasil Levski] is considered the greatest man, he was a revolutionary fighting against the Ottoman rule in the 19th century
But we have many heroes in our history:
[Hristo Botev] - also a revolutionary and great poet
[Georgi Rakovski] - same
[St
Paisiy Hilendarski] - the author of "History SlavicBulgarian", very important book for Bulgarians
[Ivan Vazov] - "the Patriarch of Bulgarian literature".
Also many Tzars and Khans from our history - [Tzar Simeon The Great] [Khan Asparuh] [Khan Krum] [Knyaz Boris I] [Tzar Kaloyan] and more
The list is very long of poets, writers, painters, clergymen, generals, prime ministers, many
many revolutionaries and so on
Vasil Levski - He had an important role for our liberation
(not sure how to add Bulgarian flag in my name so take note I'm talking about Bulgaria)
Vasil Levski: this is the main guy, during ottoman occupation we had all these ruffian "haiduks" that occasionally showed some resistance to the occupation, but this dude was an intellectual who united the intelligentsia of the country into committees
He was heavily influenced by the French revolution and the American revolutionary war and organised resistance in Bulgaria
He's the main hero because he had very social political ideas
Paisi hilendarski (paisius of the Hilendar monastery): so first take into account that Bulgaria was under Turkish occupation for 500 years
Even the most stubborn patriots start to become assimilated after such a long time of suppression
This guy went through all the ancient libraries of all the few Christian monasteries of Bulgaria to try and find some historic info on who the Bulgarians were
He had a pivotal role in reigniting the cultural identity of the Bulgarians by reacquainting them with their history
Hristo Botev: poet, teacher and revolutionary fighter
This dude is almost as famous as levski
He didn't start the whole organisation but he did organise the uprising effort from Romania with all the Bulgarians that had fled from Turkish law/violence
Khan Tervel: The king of the first Bulgarian empire, made peace with the roman empire and helped them defeat the arabs who were going up take Constantinople
If you think you're lucky that the French yeeted the arabs from Europe, you should definitely know about this guy
Khan Krum: defeated the romans and actually managed to kill the first roman emperor
Made a cup out of the dudes skull
He also made the first laws of the Bulgarians and won us thrace if I'm not mistaken
Tsar Boris: this guy got us Christianity, which some current Bulgarians are happy about, but he also got us the caesar title (that's where tsar comes from, Russia take note)
Kliment Ohridski (kliment from ohrid): you know that weird Russian alphabet
This dude invented it together with some colleagues
Due to shoddy edution most people think Cyril and Methodius made the cyrillic alphabet but they made the glagolitic alphabet
Don't know why but tsar simeon wanted another alphabet so the Preslav literary school made the cyrillic alphabet named in honour of their old teacher Cyril
The main known guy to have been part of this creation was Kliment
Tsar Simeon: this dude was one of the most successful tsars in our history
Its during this time we began heavily contributing culturally though a large bit of it is lost because the ottomans like destroying things
Kaloyan and the Asen brothers : these guys are famous for creating the second Bulgarian empire after we were taken over by the Romans
It took varangians, the Kiev Rus and the byzantine romans with the most legendary General they have ever had in their entire history to finally kick our assess
Nonetheless the Asen brothers created an uprising and we were free again
Then Kaloyan continued after them and defeated the Latin empire that had taken over constantinople
Polkovnik serafimov: Polkovnik is something like colonel and his last name was Serafimov
This dude is a hero because when we had the first balkan war this dude refused orders from above to abandon some villages in the Rhodopes knowing that the Turks have a bit of a sick history with what they do to innocent villagers and he fought against far greater numbers and still managed to win the battle and save these villages
X voivoda: I'm leaving the name blank but voivoda means leader of a haiduk group
This is a band of rebels or bandits
Technically they weren't always good guys but the really bad were eventually called kurdzhali and generally most celebrated haiduk voivods are the ones that never did anything bad
These are generally seen as resistance fighters or partizans who fought against Turkish occupation
The ones that actually did are the ones people actually mention whereas those that robbed and killed anyone are generally forgotten
In a way the haiduti are the pirates of the Bulgarians and the voivods the captains
I don't know about Italy, but in Bulgaria, Garibaldi is very respected, he inspired some of our own 19th century revolutionaries like [Georgi Rakovski] and [Captain Petko Voyvoda] One of the main squares in central Sofia is named after him and there are a few monuments in his memory
He's more of an anti-hero
Left out are: gotse delchev, ljuben karavelov, todor alexandrov, georgi benkovski, peyo yavorov, etc etc
It's all of them dying and the take over by the communists why we're currently so bad off
We have a whole cathedral named after him
I have great-grandparents that took part in both Balkan wars and the first World War (not sure about the Second)
Some of them were part of the [battle and capture of Odrin (Edirne)]
Interesting when Bulgaria was released from the  ottoman empire it was separated in to two parts one is the kingdom of Bulgaria and the other was East romelia so the Turks called us Romans for 20 years
Simeon I held the title "Emperor and Autocrat of all Bulgarians and Romans" and we used to claim that Tarnovo was the third Rome
So there's that
Whether we have is [up for interpretation] but personally I wouldn't say Bulgaria's claim to this is the worst one out there
Trajan's rule was remembered in these lands until the medieval period, and up until the 11th century (which is when we became a East Roman vassal for 100 years) our rulers actually claimed the title Emperor
The ones afterwards did too, to varying degrees of validity
I'd say we tried our best to cosplay as Rome
I see lots of polish people at my work and for me it sounds like I just had a stroke
Like  I SHOULD be able to understand it, it sounds almost like Russian
but for some reason I don't. Most of the other slavic languages are the opposite for me - they may be easier to understand but they sound very different
Taxis near the airports
I can see how this can make a scene but how can they force you to pay without beating you up
In which case .. why bother the theatre with the wallet and not straight up beat you
All the Dutch are so quiet
Come on, don't act as if your education isn't a shit show
It's really messed up, most teachers in public schools get less than 1000BGN (about 500EUR) a month, then there's the constant changes of how school works then there's the НВО after 7th grade which changes every year, 7th year itself is hell, and much, much more
This system sucks
A lot
No wonder people go to better countries later on in their life
Here it's almost the same but luckily no religion
Millions to religion
I'm really worried about Poland
Damn, most of this also applies here,too
That's criminal
That money could be used way better
Now it's just thrown in the trash and actively promotes the decrease in intelligence of your population
That's real bad
Goulash - the first thing I ate in Prague in a restaurant called "U Parlamentu" in Stare Mesto
That is the best thing I have eaten anywhere else abroad
Ever
Wait
Raw cucumber
How else do you eat cucumber
Do you cook it
I knew it
I tried it in Bulgaria years ag, cooked by a friend but didn't like it at all
So when I went to Czechia I ordered it out of interest and I really liked it
I have never EVER eaten cooked cucumber
We pickle cornichons here, but they are not the large cucumbers we call
[cucumbers]
The ragout
Most of the time i just say a random tongue twister to impress them
"No I will not" or just some random sentence for greeting someone
So, sorry mate, we just wanted our territories back as they were before the Ottoman empire
Also, who doesn't like to have another sea where to go sunbathing and chilling
Yeah, we did have a dispute with Turkey, too but not anymore
I think, at least for me it's FYROM - it's a very difficult talk and we are trying to build again a strong relationship but also I have been to the country and I saw and heard what are they thinking of us truly
It wasn't really pretty and I really can't understand the hate towards us
Не се сърди човече.
Не се сърди човече
We have the same game, the name is "Don't be angry, man
I know Presov and Komarno
I learned that last one when I was flying aimlessly in Google Earth around the danube and I saw on the Wiki that Komarno and Komarom were one city but then after the dissolution of Austria-Hungary one part was left in Hungary and the other in (Czecho)Slovakia
Австро-Унгария (Avstro-Ungariya)

That we are thieves
The communist apocaliptic poordom made it rather profitable
From corrupt Politicians (most communists stayed in power), Trough the gypsy minority that has whole self sugregated group of wallet thieves,
to the bulgarian (and romanian) cyber thieves that are constantly arrested for draining credit cards
Also **worst of all** there are the **Phone scammers** \- they call old people, using kids or teens and fake that fatal car accident had happened and unless they pay up, their grandchildren go to jail
So in moment of panic those people give away all their savings ! its heathbreaking story
The thieves oftenly use the money to build a lavish mansions, that oftenly end up burned to crisp by the relatives of those that had suffered
We are currently on our 4th Constitution:
* **Tarnovska Constitution** \- enacted in 1879, after Liberation it was the Constitution that defined Bulgaria as a constitutional monarchy, ruled by a Knyaz (after Independence - Tsar) and with a unicameral Parliament;
* **Dimitrov Constitution** \- enacted in 1947 and named after the National traitor and butcher Georgi Dimitrov, this Constitution defined Bulgaria as a "Pеople's Republic" with pseudo democracy;
* **Zhivkov Constitution** \- enacted in 1971 and named after the Communist dictator and a sock puppet come to life Todor Zhivkov it reorganised the country and established a single party system of which the Bulgarian Communist Party is the only legal legislative and executive organ;
* **The current Constitution** \- enacted in 1991, defining Bulgaria as a "Republic", declaring political pluralism, market-based economy and a ban on a party or entity ever declaring it's self above or indeed - the source of soverignity, which the Constitution defines as "the people";
* **GERB's Proposal for a New Constitution** \- after two months of anti-government protests and accusations that the current ruling government can't provide the change demanded by the street, the ruling GERB party and it's braindead leader Boyko Borisov, came up with the briliant idea to write a new Constitution
The Parliament won't be dissolved, you see - because the people want change, so this discredited Parliament and this discredited government will discuss the project for the new Constitution by the end of their term, so we have that one in the bag now too
According to the current Constitution, a Constitutional ammendment is allowed to be done by Parliament if 3/4 of all MPs approve the ammendment via the voting in of a Constitutional Ammendment Act
The sections of the Constitution that are in the prerogative of the Grand National Assembly cannot b changed by the regular Parliament
A new Constitution can only be written and enacted by the Grand National Assembly
A Grand National Assembly is like a temporary Senate - it holds 400, rather than 240 MPs, it can only be formed for the purpose to write a new Constitution, to change the territorial reach of Bulgaria, to declare wars etc
катерица / katerica
/'katɛrit͡sə/
Pretty easy to pronounce
Edit: As others said, it comes from the verb 'катеря' (katerja) meaning 'to climb'.
Катерица (Kateritsa)  from катеря   (climb)
Катерица (kah-teh-r-ee-tza), etymology suggests "creature (or object) that climbs".
Our entire language is impossible for foreigners but I feel like this word isn't even that bad
The ц fucks people up, and our Rs (р) are different than most (non-slavic) languages
I’ve never studied Russian but I’m pretty sure it is
The Bulgarian “ц” is like the English “ts”, German “z”, Czech/Serbo-Croatian “c” etc
Many
And the thing us that very often on international level our government would support some policy while domestically would execute exactly the opposite
I did, but few can afford it
I needed math for the university entrance exams for what I wanted to study, and the things we were taught in the private courses were both not taught in highschool, and 100% necessary to pass even with the minimum
The only public highschool that teaches math like that in my city is literally called a mathematics highschool
I guess it's another way to gatekeep against the poor and make it appear as if we live in a meritocracy, when it's not even approaching one
People don't try to fix the system if they believe it's already fair
Yeah
People use it for the bigger exams like for 7th grade (before entering a high school) and before entering an university or 12th grade
For 12th grade some people start to prepare 2-3 years before them, at least if you wanna go to medical university
Very prominent, though in certain years
You won't see elementary students going to private classes
There might be a few exceptions but it isn't common
A lot of people start going in middle school
Some start in 5th grade if their elementary school didn't prepare them well for middle school
Others start in 6th grade to prepare for the exams in 7th grade
The students that get good grades in school usually start to go in 7th grade
For me, going to Bulgarian classes was necessary (mostly because I had only been in Bulgaria for about 3-4 years back then) but math was unnecessary - our school teacher taught us more than what I learnt during the private lessons
After that, it depends on where you want to go after high school
If you want to get in a good university with a good bach, some start going to lessons as early as 9th or 10th grade
I know a lot of people who wanted to study Medicine who took harder Biology and Chemistry classes from 9th grade to get ready for the entrance exams
In 12th grade, a lot of people go to private lessons for the end of the year exams then
I personally went to a Bulgarian tutor for the 12th grade exams and I went to courses provided by the university I wanted to get into for their math exam, since it is much harder than the end of the year exam in Math
Prepaeing for university exams in school is impossible unless your school is specialised in what you want to study
Outside of school, it's very common to sign up kids for language lessons
There's an oversaturation of English courses - every second Bulgarian that's my age that I've met has gone to some course
German is also very popular, followed by French and Spanish
We store eggs in the fridge
no Life is Life
Bulgaria doesn't have good train connections tbh
The farthest you can go in one train is Budapest, thru Romania(if it still exists, I know it did back in 2018)
Others are Belgrade(done that, can't recommend), Thessaloniki and Istanbul
As I said I've done only one and it took something like 13 hours to do the ~450km route from my city to Belgrade
The part in Bulgaria wasn't that bad (did 140km for about 2 hours) but Serbia honestly has third world level of railways
If I am driving without stopping I can easily go to Austria or even Germany for those 13hrs
To answer your question - I draw the line at about 100km in our neighboring countries
After that I prefer busses/planes/cars etc
Man you should visit the Balkans
I learned at 21 years old
Most people, locals and foreigners, are very shocked by this
I was just never taught, and never owned a bike past the age of 5 or so
Never got to the point where they take off the training wheels
I'm not very confident while riding a bike but I'm actually glad I taught myself, despite loved ones trying to teach me (and giving up) over the years
A game where you are a bulgarian rebel (haidutin) who fights the ottomans
Something like wolfenstein but not Sci-fi
There was an obscure FPS that came out 10 or so years ago that was kinda that
You played as a time traveler from the future who went to the Roman Empire, the American Revolution and some other periods that I don't remember now
Edit: it's called Darkest of Days
Mix in some Mongols and it's complete
Anyone have nicknames for Bulgarians
We call Romanians 'Mamaligari' - basically eating mamaliga (maize poridge)
We call Serbs and pretty much every Slavic nation on the balcans 'Brate' - brother
Italians are called 'Jabari'. That means eating frogs
I think it's more appropriate for the French, but it is what it is
A nickname for Macedonians is 'Máke'
Very wide spread and derogatory term for gipsies is 'Mangal'. It means а vessel for transporting ember, fire or coal
We sometimes call the Germans "шваби" which in Bulgarian means people from Schwaben
It is not offensive or something just a "smart" way to talk about Germans without using the word Germans
Bulgaria
One of my Finnish friend claims that Swedes call Finland "Sweden's retarded little brother".
Doesn't that just mean "goodbye" in German
Tow periods come to mind:
Bulgaria during the rule of Tsar Simeon
The Bulgarian state had 3 seas at its borders, so they say stuff like "Bulgaria on three seas
The Balkan wars since we had just gotten our Unification and independence and we were beating armies while at disadvantage
Also during that time period we managed to besiege and capture the Odeon fortress, which was deemed impossible to capture by the Germans - and we did it in 3 days
The awakening era
You'll see these idiots putting pictures of levski and botev all over the place without even knowing they were socialists wanting to create a Republic
Additionally they always brag about our medieval history between 600 and 1300
wait you mean you guys were also SHIELDS AGAINST THE MUSLIM HORDES
From a personal experience: Pleven (I have bad memories from there)
Dimitrovgrad, Kardzhali, Pernik or Targovishte these are the cities which i will say are the worst
Ah, Pernik, so many stereotypes and low-quality memes
Yes they are but I try to talk as hard as I can
I come from a region in South-Eastern Bulgaria known for its very soft pronunciation
As my Ukrainian teacher said once people didn't notice she is a Russian(don't fight me she is indeed from a Russian family, raised in Ukraine) and people assumed she was born in here
Sometimes I just slip up
As for foreigners  - they just assume we are talking funny Russian and don't make difference between different dialects I think
I'm from Eastern Bulgaria or " the province". I mean, they call everything the province except the capital Sofia
When I lived in Western Bulgarian, a lot of people mocked me because of my accent and pronunciation
Everyone told me that I said every emphasis wrong
While in Eastern Bulgaria, we think the Westerners are those who can't speak
I think they are legal
Altho they shouldn't be and nobody should work for free
NOBODY
I've graduated and am working in the construction engineering sector in DK
Internships in it are an absolute must if you want to graduate - min
6 months (or one full semester) is required, and finding a position is entirely up to you, but companies have strong policies in favour of interns
Unpaid internships are not illegal but extremely rare
Companies usually pay a rather symbolic sum (around a third of what you would normally get as a junior employee) to interns
The choice whether you would like to extend your internship (either continue in your previous company or find another) is also up to you but not opposed by the university
If you do, then you are officially a student worker, with a slight increase in your payment plus a possibility to get SU on top (depending on the amount they are giving you)
If you reside and work in country A, but come from country B, country A is responsible for your health and social security
As a resident of country A you get the same rights and the same access to services, natives get
But if you've worked and retired in country A and after retirement move to country B, country A is responsible for your pension, while country B - for your health and social security
This is why many Brits retire in Bulgaria
Or at least
they used to before Brexit
They receive their British pensions and live in the countryside of Bulgaria where they can't spend much, because everything is cheap or they grow it themselves
Definetely chalga(turbo-folk in other slav countries)
Some prime examples of emberassing songs(but still very popular that we all listen to) include [Azis-Sen Trope] and [Azis-Ledena Kralica]
It's a music genre that was full with cheap music videos, absurdly funny and dumb lyrics and overplayed imstrumentals
Nowadays it's still the same, the music videos have become quite good though
For modern chalga that's popular/good:
Here's an old school song I love:
Also this one:
And here's a song made from a rapper in 1 week, which is somewhat of a parody of retro chalga/kyucheck:
And here are some modern chalga songs which are emberassing:
Gosho ot Pochivka and his ''fiesta of swear words in his songs''. Like the guy has at least 4 swear words in his sentences
isnt she Ukrainian lol
There's so much stealing/buying of songs in this genre it's honestly hard to keep track of everything
I know of a Romanian version of Sen Trope that was released after Azis's, but there could be a Serbian one too that I don't know of
About the origin of chalga, I think it's generally accepted that it was invented alongside turbo-folk, although some sources like Wikipedia state chalga was first and that the citizens of Yugoslavia copied it
In Bulgarian, it's fatherland (and there are st least two words that mean that) and mother's tongue
Not at all in the UK
Most houses are old, moldy and with old windows
But then, any recently renovated house will have these advance windows
I've barely ever seen windows that are not like that
Though, it depends on the age of the building
All new buildings have them, but if you see some unrenovated old ones then they likely will just have simple ones
Generally, the less urban, the higher chance of it being something else
Also generally the furhter east you go
Your experience may vary depending on the country, but overall in europe, they're more or less ubiquitous
Hmm I don't think there's anything good on Bulgarian YouTube sadly
They are a lot, but mainly two: The Clashers and 'Айде БГ. The latter make top 15 lists and challenges, and The Clashers makes tech reviews and stuff
Only reason I don't watch the other YouTubers is because they are pretty immature and make stupid and unfunny jokes
Maybe one exception is Tsvetoslav Tsonev
Yeah he's amazing
I shake hands with men that are not within my ring of closest people, and the same goes for women as well
My closest people - we hug out for greetings and for departures
Edit: mistakes fixed
I m a cat person, but most people here prefer dogs, and in my opinion the continent will be 50/50
Personal: As James from TheOdd1sOut would say: I'm bisexual for animals
^(wait)
Country: The impression I've gotten in my 21 years of living here Bulgarians seem to favor dogs
Continent: I don't know
While the official language is Bulgarian we do have a significant minority of Turks who speak Turkish if that counts
Sure, Kone doesn't sell to the avarage consumer, but I wouldn't say they are unknown
You see their brand on a lot of elevators and escalators in public places
Edit: same with ThyssenKrupp, Schindler and Otis
I'm curious, does Carl Zeiss make any products for B2C or only industrial products
Isn't Weber part of Saint-Gobain
They have products for B2C. Every big hardware store would have their cement mixes
Bulgaria: have one, but don't really need it
Use it maybe once a month for big stores like Ikea or for a day trips to places around city
There are plenty of buses, you can walk almost everywhere and work is 1 min walk from home
Russia: had one, used it quite often but mostly when with kids
Lots of people prefer cars, lots of people prefer public transport
Moscow is huge and though cars are more comfortable and convenient if you usual route is unusual, public transport is way more reliable
If your public transport commute is 2 hours that's it, always
With a car it could be 1 hour one day and 4 hours another
Porn is illegal I think
Criminal Code, Article 159:
A person who produces, displays, presents, broadcasts, distributes, sells, rents or otherwise circulates a pornographic material, shall be punished by imprisonment of up to one year and a fine from BGN 1,000 to 3,000
Anyone who distributes pornographic material by means of information or communication technology or in another similar manner shall be punished by imprisonment for up to two years and a fine from BGN 1,000 to 3,000
Which city in the Balkans do you consider as the most important and why
Why people tend to exclude Greece and European Turkey from the Balkans
They are literally defining the borders of the peninsula
Istanbul
Capital of the Eastern Roman Empire and the Ottoman Empire
Used to be a center of Orthodox Christianity and currently the center of Islam in Europe
Currently the most economically important city in the Balkans and from a historical pov is one of the most important cities in the world
I wouldn't call it the most important but Ohrid is underrated
Most people consider Greece more as Mediterranean same with Italy and Spain
They are part of Greco-Roman civilisation and usually especially before the financial crisis Greece was way richer and part of western world unlikely the rest of the Balkans
Also for Turkey many people consider them a mix of Middle East-Mediterranean people that speak a Turkic language while rest of balkans speaking indoeuropean language so this difference make many people to exclude them
But geographically both countries have a proportion of their land in balkans
It makes no sense to exclude Bulgaria from the definition
Geographically and culturally it is firmly situated in the Balkans
The Balkans are named "Balkan" after Bulgarian mountains tho
Most of the Balkans: are in Bulgaria
Westerners: Bulgaria isn't in the balkans
Okay
Interesting
Ohrid
Veliko Tarnovo
Instanbul
Athens
All better choices using your criteria
We learnt it different
Geographically the mainland yeah it is but usually Greece included with the rest of Mediterraneans like Italy and Spain
Mainland Greece is nearly a quarter of the total area of the Balkans
Isn't 90% of the Balkan range in Bulgaria
Anyway people often say that Bulgaria isn't in the Balkans
Americans specifically think Yugoslavia = Balkans and even calls the Yugoslav wars "The Balkan Wars"
Why wouldn't Greece be part of the Balkans
It is one of the 7 countries which has 100% of its mainland in the peninsula and accounts for about 23% of the Balkan territory
Hmmm nope
All their islands are not part of Balkan Peninsula but yeah I understand your point
I think especially northern Greece have more Balkan vibes but the south is more Mediterranean to me
I get it
As others have pointed out, the definition varies, whether you talk about culture or geography
I myself only know the geographical boundaries of the region, as I am also not familiar with cultural delimitations, if any
That is why I said 100% of the **mainland** which is 88% of the area of the country
I just never heard people define the Balkan peninsula around 'vibe'.
To be honest Greece especially the southern part I feel that has much more in common with Italy or Spain than North Macedonia or Bosnia
But that’s my thought
Greece has more Mediterranean vibes than the rest of the balkans
So that’s why I prefer to go for vacation there than the Black Sea and basically that’s the reason I usually consider them more as Mediterranean country than Balkan
If you asked 10 people in the Balkans 10 of them would
And I doubt any would include Slovenia
I have been to Greece many times and has big differences than the rest of neighbours like NM, Serbia even Romania
If I have to categorise Greece I would put them as Mediterraneans
They are slightly darker skinned than the rest and also they are somewhat more western than us
Also Turkey despite have land in Balkan Peninsula I wouldn’t consider them as that
They are closer to Middle East
But that’s my opinion ofc
Are we categorising people or a geographical location
By that logic, if Bulgaria was richer and spoke a different language, it would automatically be excluded from the Balkans
Why are you shocked
As an example Many People consider Czechia as Eastern Europe and Austria central or western despite geographically is more eastern
Is the first time ever you hear it
I wish
Just Yugoslavia
We're always left out :(
You might find some Roman ruins or some Thracian gold
But you might also find a shell bomb from ww2
I think it's quite common
More than you hear about it about Bulgaria
For example my dad found some old weapons
turned out it was a large battle from more than 300 years ago
Not that dense in some cities
We got bombed to bits and had our capitals burnt and got bombed again and then communism
I live in Stara Zagora, Bulgaria
Every day on my way to my university, I walk through a park filled with remnants of ancient monuments and columns with all sorts of inscriptions on them
In the university basement they have excavated a neolithic settlement with a few dwellings which are more than 8000 years old with some old stone tools and clay statues in them
Same in Bulgaria, we've been struggling to build in Thessaloniki because we haven't had it for like a thousand years now
One day, one day
The most common here is "zele" (cabbage) , but I've heard "marmalad " (marmalade) and "usmivka" (smile) as well
"Зеле" (meaning "cabbage") is traditional
However, "сирене" (cheese) is also a popular option
Usually it's whether we are or speak Russian
We're not and we don't. The other thing is, we usually get asked questions about the Yugoslav war or some bullshit about "the powderkeg of Europe". It gets old considering we didn't take any part in the Yugoslav war and haven't been in a war since WW2
There was this English guy who tried super hard to convince me that I speak and understand Russian after I told him I am Bulgarian
And told me that I was in denial and I was just pretending by saying that I don't speak nor I understand Russian because I have never studied it in my life
Then he started testing me by asking me some basic Russian words (idk how he knew them) which were very similar to Bulgarian and I knew them, and with that, he became absolutely convinced that I was pretending and lying
This was like asking 'Do you know what perfecto, dramatico, economico mean
YOU DO
OMG YOU SPEAK SPANISH WHY ARE YOU PRETENDING THAT YOU DON'T SPEAK SPANISH
> Bulgarians are particularly annoyed by the phrase "Russian alphabet"
Oh yeah, that one pushes all the buttons
> happy liberation day
Thank you
I'm afraid I can't even fake out ones
Eh Bulgaria has the cheapest booze but same goes for salaries
It helps with tourism tho
Oh boy, Ottoman Empire occupied Bulgaria for nearly 500 years, was separated in two after it split from it, had to get independence separately, then had two balkan wars on opposite sides and communism pretty much separated Bulgaria and Eastern bloc from the rest of the world so yeah if relations are improving, it's now
Created the Cyrillic alphabet
Hasn't changed its name since its founding in 681 AD
I mainly use potato for fries so if potatoes disappeared I'd just improvise with other vegetables and hide any weird flavours with mayo
In my country there is not a single place where they sell Doners without potatoes in it
Dont know how
Well i am from phone
I feel like it could be Bulgaria
Every sport in which we stand a chance (not many occassions though)
Well, the Balkans would either start fighting on the table, as we usually do, or get drunk with rakija or something and start dancing traditional dances to folk music
Imma be doing a sirtaki, as we call it
This is very accurate
I feel like that's the best description of the Balkans so far
No, Bulgaria is not 100% comprised of gypsies who will steal your TV
You guys really got the short end of the stick with "Roma" being a word
I will just take my leave,kind sir
10% I think
The last census was in 2011 iirc
Haha yes, this is trigger number 1
Хахаха, did I get your reply correctly
Gypsies in general
I don't know about the biggest ever but if we exclude anything politics-related (cuz that's a shitshow) then I think Pulev's harassment scandal was pretty viral
[Bulgarian boxer Kubrat Pulev kisses a journalist during an interview then she sues him for harassment
Well, I don't listen to pop, but was pretty shocked to learn "turn me on" does not refer to turning an engine, machine or switch on/ off
And he sings it like "champion" anyway
&#x200B;
Happy achievement
I myself could surely participate more
Sorry for that, but my time management still sucks
Anyway, I enjoy browsing this subreddit and learning about the other European countries so much
Greetings to all users here
Goddamn that's a nice salary
What do I have to do to earn this much in Finland
A moratorium on executing death penalties was introduced when the comunist regime collapsed but the actual Penal Code texts, perscribing the death penalty, were completely redacted to drop it, on 10^(th) of December 1998
Ironically, the last death penalty was executed 4 days before the moratorium came in effect
Yes, here if a holiday happens to be on Saturday/Sunday the Monday after it's a day off , but this year its a day off anyway because today is Easter Monday which is a day of by default
Yes, but the Orthodox Easter was this weekend, so we get the 3rd off and the 4th off as well because the 1st was on a Saturday
It is a day off, but not because of Workers' day
Last Sunday was Orthodox Easter, so we had a day off last Friday, are having one today and are going to have another one tomorrow
And, since this Thursday is also a major Orthodox Christian holiday (6th May - St
George's day), we are skipping work and school then as well
It transfers to Monday, but since Monday is already a holiday it goes to the first working week day, in this case Tuesday
So Tuesday, 04
05, is a day off because of 01
Knife
I would never trust scissors to be clean enough, even if I just washed them myself
As it should be done
Emperor Nicephoros, not a great emperor really, but a decent cup
Nikephoros I because we made a good cup out of his head
Pretty weird to pick Julius Caesar of all people as someone who was hard done by history
He literally wrote much of his own history and excelled at public relations
There are so many other emperors who were vilified more by contemporary historians
Caesar's reputation is so stellar that the titles Tsar and Kaiser were still used into the 20th century while not too many people know about the atrocities he committed during his military campaigns
Without having read the book in question, sounds like the author had an idea in mind and looked for ways to "prove" it, rather than honestly search for the truth
Our sources for the Antiquity are usually so few and brief that you can try to prove just about any thesis
The time of Julius Caesar's rise and fall is better documented than most periods prior to the High Middle Ages, sure, but it's still filled with humongous gaps, AFAIK
And now that I googled this Michael Parenti I see that he doesn't have a history degree and most of his books are about the twentieth century (and rather suspect, according to some posts on r/askhistorians as well) . Call me elitist, but I would rather trust historians with good reputation among academics, who specialise in the respective period
Anyway, a person can be a just reformer and a tyrant at the same time, many of the best known reformers in history were quite tyrannical indeed
I suspect the motives for the assassination of Julius Caesar were probably many and varied among his killers
Killing him to protect the oligarchy, never mind that the Populares were themselves a party full of aristocrats sounds to me like a very modern, rather forced reading of the situation but again, I am not particularly familiar with this period in history
Julius Caesar was a very complex and controversial figure, there is really no need to fully trust any single historian's view on the matter
We have a city named Pernik near the capitol, and people always joke that you"ll get beaten up if you go there
They also have a funny accent and drive VW Golf 3
Cinema center (Kinotsentar or Киноцентъра) in Sofia, Bulgaria
Its at the lower parts of Vitosha mountain and most TV shows and mainstream music videos are shot there
What can also be breathtaking is the air pollution in sofia
That's curious
In Bulgarian churka means "a small dick" as in a diminutive to the word
Never would have thought it would be a slur in Russian
Bit late to the party but most of Balkandji songs perfectly fit your criterua
[this one is my personal favorite]
Well , I nominate [The Black Sheep] from the band Ahat , the most famous Bulgarian metal/rock song .
I really like this [one] . I hope you like it too :) , sadly it doesnt have a national instrument involved in it
One of the only Bulgarian rock songs I know [Черната Овца]
There's a solid rock/metal scene in Bulgaria, a couple of classics are  [The Black Sheep by Ahat] and [Diamond and Glass by B.T.R.]
For Bulgaria it is chervenkov
He was our version of Stalin
The case that ruled ДПС constitutional is fascinating
ДПС is predominantly an ethic party, which is illegal under the Bulgarian constitution but they claimed that they were a liberal party to get around this
On the day of decision, two areas were considered for the first, 6 judges voted it was unconstitutional and 5 that it was
They are 12 judges in total, the other one was sick
For the second, it was claimed that the documents had not been submitted in time and it ought not be considered
This resulted in a non-verdict
The courts since refused to hear other cases arguing the matter is decided
ДПС has gone on to have a very colourful history in Bulgarian politics and participated in countless corruption scandals while acting as a king maker in politics
Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg
They used to be the precursors of the Shengen, because they generally had cross-border agreements before it (not sure about that)
Wealthy nations, especially Luxembourg, part of the floodplains of the southern edge of the continental ice during the last Ice Age
I know that Belgium has administrative division, based on ethnicity with each divisin having their own government and Brussels had this weird division as well
Belgium has 4 (?) official languages, Netherlands and Luxembourg have three (?)
More people work in Luxembourg than live in it - many people work there but commute to Germany or Netherlands where they live, thus the state's GDP is benefiting from that
The people of the Netherlands will save Bangladesh one day
Yes, Bulgarian has singular and plural "you" and "thank" is just a verb
You can add a pronoun or not
Probably it is more common to just say "blagodarya" but if you want to be more personal, you definitely add a pronoun "blagodarya ti" or "blagodarya vi".
If i understood you correctly, then here how its in Bulgarian to thank someone when speaking for yourself :blagodarya благодаря: and if your speaking for your group its :blagodarim благодарим: and then add :ti ти: (if you are speaking to 1 person), :vi ви: (if you are speaking to more than 1 person) and :Vi Ви: (This is for both if you are talking to 1 or a few people formally and yes its the same as when you are speaking in a casual conversation but with :V В: being capital) Also sorry if you had a stroke trying to read some parts of what i said
Rakia in case I get sick, need to clean something or want to get piss drunk
Flag to remind of great mother Bulgaria
My dog cuz otherwise the world would be dark
Potato
Soap
Deck of cards
Swiss knife
Baseball hat to hide my ugly head
Book
Phone
And maybe in would yet money or clothes or some other needles things if I had the space
You'd be surprised to find anything other than a crew cut or a buzz cut here tbh
Same thing here lol
Everything, to the word
I don’t think that’s true but I guess it might be where you live
I used to have long hair in my teenage years and I think the reason it’s a lot less common than short hair is because it takes much more effort to maintain and during summer it just gets way too hot
>Богомолка
Bogomolka
It means "she who prays to God"
The Mystery of the Bulgarian Voices - they've been touring the world since the 70s.
Assuming I work a low-wage job in a high-pay country just because I'm Bulgarian ... smh
yikes
Help WESTERN Europe
Four or five
I work about 25h a week at an art store, I get to use the wifi and read books when it isn't busy
Every employer is required by law to insure you, so I've got that covered, I get insured on full-time but I get half the yearly paid vacation because my hours technically qualify as part time
There's a coffee machine, and that's about it
Pretty good compared to most jobs in the entire country
It is perfect actually, I love it haha
Yes, we have paid sick leave
You can take up to 10 consecutive days from your G.P, anything more (up to six months) requires a sort of "medical council" with more than one doctor, I think
Your first few days off, your salary is covered by your employer, the rest is covered by insurance
This has happened to me in Sofia
I wish people would feel this comfortable and friendly even when they're not drunk
The coming of Cyril and Methodius' students to Bulgaria
Tsar Boris asks them to create literary school in Ohrid and Preslav (Pliska at first)
This event is important because with the creation of the Cyrillic alphabet and the development of a Bulgarian culture, during the time of Simeon, the Bulgar nobility is completely assimilated into the Slav population, creating what can finally be called Bulgarians
Edit: or the revival period, from Istoriya Slavyanobulgarska (1762) to our "independence" in 1878
During this period authors like Ivan Vazov take up the task to recreate and modernize Bulgarian literature, grammar and spelling
Interestingly enough a sizeable chunk of what is said in literature from that time can be applied to modern Bulgaria
The songs, poems and books had a goal in mind when they were written, to awaken the Bulgarian people and light the fire in their hearts for freedom, this is a tough task - trying to make people want freedom when they know the cost of blood that will have to be spilled, having been enslaved for 500 years and having numerous failed rebellions
I would add the April Uprising of 1876 as it helped Bulgaria to finally gain recognition and on the fact what is really happening in the Ottoman empire
Also the Unification between East Rumelia and thr Bulgaria Kingdom
Two words: DROB SARMA
It’s popular, it has liver, it’s nasty and can make me vomit by simply being near me
I dont think its a popular food but I absolutely despise mish-mash
Its got my vote for the worst food maybe in the history of Earth itself
> there is a tendency to stereotype every European cuisine other than France, Italy, Spain, Greece and Portugal as horrendous and bland
This makes the Balkans cry every time
Liver smells horrendous to me
We call that pacha in Bulgaria
I remember looking it up and so many countries have it all over the world and I cannot understand why the fuck its a thing
It's so disgusting
I love the taste of mish mash but the texture is too soft on it's own
It needs something to make it not feel like eating vomit
>One of my favorite foods though are dolmas, which are Greek I think
A lot of countries have that dish not just Greece
But every country has their regional variations on exact ingredients and their ratio
One of my favorite things to eat is pasta with butter and feta (but the Bulgarian version that is very tangy)
In the US the most popular known version is the Greek one for sure
But things like musaka, spinach pie, baklava, feta, gyros/döner/etc
, tzatziki, souvlaki, etc
are part of the cuisine from the Balkans to the Middle East (and some occasionally found elsewhere)
But there are regional variations and they're sometimes called different names
Cool thing is if you like one of them there's like 10 different versions of it you can try lol
People drawing graffiti everywhere, even monuments
There are 28 in the whole country - 17 in Sofia, 3 in Varna , 2 in Plovdiv , 2 in Burgas,  2 on Trakia highway, 1 in Sunny Beach,  1 on Hemus highway
There are somwath popular in Sofia and not as much in the rest of the country
There are quite a few of them in Bulgaria, at least 4-5 in Sofia
A shame we can’t get some *better* American fast food here, like Taco Bell or Chick Fil A. I think Taco Bell would be wildly popular here
And that is exactly the reason why the UK is one of the most obese nations in the world
The average income in the capital is almost twice as high as the rest of the country, so life in Sofia is more expensive as well
That being said, prices for basic stuff like food etc
aren’t that different
The biggest difference is the almost crippling shortage of kindergartens and nurseries
The deficit is in the thousands and the problem is so serious people protest it regularly and some parents have formed communal kindergartens in order to cope
Currently you can call the Ministry of Interior affairs and ГДБОП (specialised police) our drug kingpins
I'd guess Kurdzhali province, since it's right at the southern border and it's populated primarily by ethnic Turks
I mean, the government would have to fuck up pretty badly for this to happen, but if any place were to secede, Kurdzhali would be it
None really, although there is a province in the southeast part of Bulgaria with Turkish majority but those don't seem to be inclined for independence/integration in Turkey
Other than that in the southwest province of Blagoevgrad there's a NMacedonian 'party' which makes a fuss about secession every now and again, but their number is a few hundred which compared to the 320 000 living in the province is nothing
Btw there was a protest movement in the Northwest to have three provinces join Romania because of the alleged "ignoring" of the region when it comes to funding and development
It went nowhere and was largely seen as a joke/protest here
Unite Bavaria, Austria and Switzerland and have the ultimate Alpenrepublik
You wouldn't be too happy if California suddenly decided that it isn't a part of the US anymore, would you
I'll waste a few leva or volunteer for the Slovene army if it comes to fighting the Austrians
Yes, there are stray dogs everywhere especiallyin big citiessuch as Sofia, Plovdiv,  Pernik etc
, but even in my small 5k town there are 2 packs that most of the time are harmless but some times lash on people and scare children
Oh we have a shit ton, not a city or village in Bulgaria where you won't see some sorta stray animal
Yes, both
In sofia it’s terrible
In Burgas there are probably only a few stray dogs but a lot of cats
I don’t know about the country as a whole but the town where I live(Pirdop, it’s a fairly small town about 80 km to the east of Sofia) has a fairly large amount of strays
I know my mom was once bitten by one and my brother got scared by one
I don’t spend much time in Pirdop because of School and Uni, the current pandemic situation not withstanding, but I haven’t had any problems with strays
All kinds of stray animals in Sofia, mostly cats
If I had to guess it's about a 10:1 ratio of cats to dogs
It's worse in smaller towns, I think
Stray dog pack do a lot more than scare children
In the last years there are more active efforts to castrate them, so at least there are no fatalities recently
Yes, thats what lash on people is there, my grandfather was attacked and bitten a few times 4 or 5 years ago
And yea , the castration is more active than it was years ago
Here blue pens seem to be mare used than black , or other colors
No, usually the dialects are considered not correct
Open faced sandwich with meat and/or cheese, topped with fresh cut tomato and some 'colourful salt' (popular mix of herbs and spices)
Commonly referred to as a "princessa" but some parts of the country call it a "strandjanka". This is a topic of debate and heated argument, whether they are different, how so, and which is correct
Probably going to be what our next civil war is about
I'm a subway boi
Uh we aren't bankrupt yet
Fiscally Bulgaria is actually in a pretty good spot
Privacy who needs that, right
We're kinda in the same situation
Says who
Boyko
The data
Country has 20% debt to GDP ratio which is one of the lowest in Europe
From 2016 to 2018 our budget surplus has grown by 1 percent per year
Our credit rating was upgraded last year
Country is farthest from being bankrupt since the creation of Modern Bulgaria
I don't trust Boyko's data
Shady as fak
Here to travel with train is the cheapest,  but also slowest transportation,  I personally enjoy it , there are a lot of people hating it . So,  for example one way ticket from Sofia to Plovdiv (around 160km
/2h 30m ) is 9
15 leva (~ 4
60€) whitout discount ( 50% off for school and uni
students) .
And probably one of the longest in the country  Sofia - Varna (around 510km
/8 hours) is 23
35 leva (~11
70 €) , one way,  whitout discount
Here in Bulgaria trains are kinda slow (130km/h on main lines, realistically more like 60-90km/h on most lines, so usually slower than car, about the same speed as a bus, and the rolling stock is quite old (they have recently began to refurbish trains along main routes and adding more conveniences like power outlets and dining cars) but they are also VERY cheap
Stara Zagora to Sofia (250km, about 3:45 by train) is about 7€, with a discount it's €3,50
Free discount cards are issued to all students (incl
university) and pensionners and anyone else can buy one (€25 for 1 year)
Children under 7 travel free and bikes and pets are allowed on all trains (bike ticket is 1€ regardless of the destination), and there are also various other types of discounts like return tickets, small group tickets and so on
Sofia-Varna (520km, 8h travel time) with a sleeping coach (there are options to reserve a cabin for 1-3 people) is €17, about 10euro with a discount card
So yeah, train travel is very affordable
I have a 50% discount that costs 35€ which allows me to buy return ticket to the other side of the country for 17€
Dirt cheap
The trains are old and very slow, but the prices are very low, even by our standards
And there is a 50% discount for students and retirees
For example: a ticket from my hometown to Sofia (the capital), a trip that typically takes about 4 and a half hours by car, would take 6 hours and 10 minutes by train, but would only cost about €10, or €5 with the discount
Edit: forgot to mention: the trains are extremely comfortable
They are quite spacious as they are (waaay more so than a plane or a coach), and they are often also half-empty
So, a train is the best way to travel if you value your comfort more than your time
Same thing here
It's Bulgarian literature so nobody cares but the one I had most difficulty with was nikolay haitov - divi razkazi, or wild tales
I haven't even finished them so maybe I should revisit it
For Russian the toughest read is life and fate by vasili grossman
Just very long and too many characters where it switches too often between them and you lose track
For Dutch I'd say Harry mulisch - the discovery of heaven
Found it a bit pretentious
I read all of them, but this one killed me
Only read 1/3 of it
Not sure if any of my classmates finished it
Lol no, it's already a Bulgarian word since ancient times
It's just generally slavic
No man, the Dutch are just a bit xenophobic so they come up with all kinds of nonsense stereotypes for other countries
Not all Dutch people of course, but this seems to be one of them
All my money goes to taxes and bills
No money left for anything, my salary is considered good here
För me it is Swedish
I believe the photo is taken at Schloss Nymphenburg in Munich
See [here
To me, this sounds great
I'll try to be as active as possible
Reading some of the replies here makes me think we don't have it as bad
I think for us is the national TV which is probably the least bad of them all
БНТ1, the state's channel, followed bTV and Nova
БНТ (Bulgarian national television) has surprisingly kept its prestige even after the fall of communism and now has an array of four channels that feature the news, sporting events, TV show, movies and a lot more - it's pretty good in that regard
It's part of the big three broadcasters in Bulgaria, the other two being Nova and bTV
From a political pov they're all equally shit at being objective and you're better off even using Facebook or chatting with people to inform yourself about politics
Edit: I'm not sure whether the question was asking about the channel when you hit 1 on your remote or the best channel
I answered the former
church services
dang
oh wow, that's surprising
Here almost nobody cares about the church except some nutjobs and nationalists
It's instant Balkan scenario literally
I thought that the marijuana sold in coffee shops in the Netherlands is being grown by the government
Well, recently I found out that I was completely wrong
I remember asking dad if Aachen was in East Berlin
>like the Chechen, get massively oppressed
The same Chechens who drove out all Russians out of their republic and now run it practically as an independent country with generous subsidies
If the Chechens are oppressed, it's by other Chechens
>Sometimes also exterminate
What minorities were exterminated in Russia
This is deportation, not extermination
There are those things at Bulgarian tables too but we don't care lol
Me too
It made me feel kind of insulted lol
Each number from one to ten has a unique name, the numbers between 11 and 19 have the “надесет” (nadeset) suffix which means “ontop of ten”, so they are three on top of ten
Each consecutive decade of numbers follows the pattern: двадесет (dvadeset), meaning “two tens”, followed by “и {number name}” (and  {number name}”) and like this up to a hundred
The hundreds have a unique name - “сто” (sto)
So 400 is четиристотин (chetiristotin) followed by the decimals etc
Thousands are хиляда (hilyada) for 1000 and following the same pattern
In addition to gerginborisov's answer the rules for reading them out have nothing special 12489 would be read as twelve thousand fourhundred eighty nine
Pretty straightforward
In my city (Stats Zagira, Bulgaria) a former military base has been made into a public park, with a skate park and indoors sports arena being constructed right now
They kept the name Artillery park from the former military brigade that was housed there
Not really :(
Freestyler as well
Antique were pretty big in Europe
If by international OP means Balkan-wide fame, then the list is much longer and is primarily pop-folk, Vasilis Karras and such
If someone said hi to the people in the bus, they'd be considered crazy
I mean
that only works when you enter a train compartment and ask if the seats are taken
We've forgotten the crackers
They've become pretty popular here too in the last 10-15 years
Most men who can grow one, do
In the 90s and especially in Communist times it was either frowned upon or people were straight up told to shave it by their boss
I am really proud of my country taking measures and deciding not to play because of the pandemic
Of course, haven't you seen the results against Switzerland and Italy
For us human rights are more than crucial
Italian  My mom is a huge Adriano Celentano fan so I grew up listening to Italian music
Still want to learn it to this day
Basil II the Bulgarslayer is the most obvious example I can think of
There are streets named after him in Greece, for example
>Gotse Delchev
This is surprising
I'm not aware of him doing anything against the Greeks
The Bulgarian-Greek conflict started after his death
Haiduts ... Bulgarian outlaws that lived in the mountains and robbed ottomans during their occupation of Bulgaria
And of course someone mentioned cossacks
those guys were fucking cool
They looked fucking [cool] too
Tbh, now
Living standards are best todays, most peaceful time
If I had to pick it would be still somewhere in the 21th century
Comments here give the impression that PiS is a party made up of a bunch of triple-Hitlers that eat babies for breakfast and shoot gay people for sport in the afternoon before torching some immigrants
The way Poland has been going, I'm willing to bet they're going extreme far right
Pretty ironic for the country that holds the location of Auschwitz within its borders
You're not allowed to hope that, it's reddit
And on the spectrum (or compass), are they up or down
For reference, down is Liberal and up is authoritarian
1 in Sofia with showrooms in Varna and Plovdiv but are planning on building a new one in Varna
We have one in the Capital
Edit: There are also some small stores in the larger cities
To be fair, a high percentage of homes in a lot of countries are IKEA
The best way to define where your country is is by at your neighbours
Taihumian Republic - definitely Sahelian, with maybe the North being considered Saharan
Mumbambu - very Persian gulf-esque, but the majority Pastafarian population puts it culturally closer to Jamaica and Papua New Guinea
Kingdom of Acadia - quite tricky to determine, but I'd say it's more South American than Siberian, but some might say it actually belongs in Northeastern Australia
The despotic people's dictatorship of Hafaria - Arctic by nature, Antarctic by culture
So, I'd say that Montenegro is definitely Middle-Near-Far-West-North-Eastern Afro-South-Americo-Asio-European, with a few Polynesian and Martian hints
Hope this helps
Yes, and I'll never be convinced that it's not stupid to leave your dirty ass shoes on while home (or god forbid laying on your bed/couch with them on, which seems to be a thing according to American movies)
I've got house shoes (sandals) for indoor wear, which I thought was the norm
Boyat nastana to me is a song that could have been or anthem
Well i would say Turkish
Its mostly spoken in the Southeast, alongside the border and especially in the Kardzhali oblast/region and also in the Northeast in the provinces of Razgrad, Shumen, Targovishte, Silistra and some parts of Dobrich and Varna have it as their mother tongue
if we somehow qualify we are screwed
I don't understand comments like this
What support
The EU countries' support
The support of every European country
Do you really think most people in real life give a shit or have an opinion about Scotland's independence
Comments like that are cringy as fuck
It's a reddit thing, nobody gives a shit in real life
No, you are cringy
Pop folk- a.k.a. chalga
It was chosen to be in the centre of the Bulgarian lands but now it’s at their western edge
You can say " Ne mi puka" or "Ne mi dreme"  they both can be translated as I don't care
You can use " Prez kura mi e " witch literally means It goes through my dick
We have expressions like "не ми пука" ([it] doesn't pop on/with/whatever me) or "не ми дреме" ([it] (presumably the problem) isn't napping on me)
The affirmative forms "пука ми" (It's popping on me) and  "дреме ми" (it's napping on me) emerged from the negatives to mean "I do care", but are now used mostly sarcastically, so both the negatives and the affirmatives mean "I don't care".
Not really, it just originated as sarcasm
"Meh, [as if] I care".

Check out [International Dialects of English Archive] I've linked to the Bulgarian accents but you can check out your own country's, too
I suggest this one:
It's probably the best thing ever written by a Bulgarian, apart from poetry
It's... incredible
I absolutely recommend it
In our language just about every name has several nicknames
They can end in vowels or consonants depending on the name itself and don't follow tendencies of any kind
Perhaps that's because our names come from several different origins (there are native Slavic names, Greek ones, newly introduced American ones,  Russian ones that were popular during the Communist regime, Turkish and Roma ones for our main minorities, etc)
There's no tendency, no suffixes, no rules
There are just several nicknames that just 'sound right' for every single personal name
Oh no anything but that
This sounded like great news until I remembered we're leaving the EU
LoL, like is that supposed to be a legitimate threat by FB
"If you don't stop regulating us, we'll
, we'll stop offering you our shitty service that only middle aged women use
Oh, no
How else will my mom share pictures of her favorite soap opera and follow Gokberk Demirci
Lol, I can understand not fully having Turkey in the picture but cutting off Istanbul like that is dirty
500k is too few for its own site
Dark Humor and memes had a couple millions (if I remember correctly) and the site they made was more inactive than the discord server (which the mods abandoned one by one and eventually one of the new guys on the team nuked it
Fuck that lad it was the funniest shit)
Please don't use the S-word if you don't want to alienate all of the eastern member states
Yes, their problem is that they don't have the financial capacity for an advertisement campaign
Is it ban evasion if you make your own thing though
It's not like you were banned from the entire internet
Cheers
I will drink to that bro
Point is that the population still loves welfare, healthcare (just don't ask about taxes) and government regulation
They just don't like anything associated with the old system, especially the term it used to describe itself
Nice, now do the same for laptops please
Well USB C is already on it't third major USB gen and it has flexibility and room to grow even more
(USB 3, USB3,2 and USB 4)
Also this directive just says that A standard needs to exists not WHAT the standard IS
That is up to the USB-IF to decide
They do not count under Radio Equipment so probably not
But USB C can supply most common laptops and we can probably have a USB 4-C x2 that has double the power lanes for the really power hungry ones if it is really needed
Cause Apple
Remember the Great Charger Soup of the 2000s? Yeah how did that stifle innovation
Last I checked the USB standard introduced to stop it by EU demand is on it's 7th major version
It is because until this directive started to be drafted Apple was using it's own shit so they can sell you a dongle
With this no future Apples can screw the consumers by making their own speshul ports just so they can charge you extra
(Yes I know Lightning is good but Apple lost it's chance to beeing the next USB standard by charging a nice sum per port)
Like it slowed USB inovation when they demanded common chargers
I mean it is not like USB is on it's 7th revision:
USB 1
USB 2
USB 2
0 Revised
USB 3
USB 3
USB 3
USB 4
Reason is so people who use apple can use public utilities provided in the EU like charging ports
Why would we
Type C is actually designed for what it does
Unlike the old ones that were not meant to go on phones but for niche applications, before of course they had to standardise
And while yes there have been multiple revisions on Type C (5 total so far), so has the previous one
Those are not gags
Try again
And you can do so with power sockets
Still annoying to have the extra 20 adaptors that you do not use 99% of the time but they had to be manufactured and the resources wasted  and pollution created
By that point the only way to go is wireless
As the old ones are not significantly smaller if at all
I hate this narrative
Those cars are used by other *people*, you know
great, geoguessr will become even harder
They're so normal that I'm not actually sure if there's ads like that where I live
No need for /s, Poland needs to get its shit together
What are they proving in the middle of summer
They do this at a couple of places in Bulgaria too
This is widespread in Europe, they do it as far east as Bulgaria
And it's not new
People with celiac disease or thyroid conditions probably love that
You mean they'll get some kind of allergic rash just from touching pasta with their lips or what
It gets in the water
Well, she's an idiot
Football is an entertainment industry, so whoever gets people entertained gets paid more, and people like Ronaldo entertain people a LOT
She isn't paid the same as Ronaldo because there are many biological researchers and there is only one Ronaldo
In the labor market supply and demand regulate wages
There could be a great demand for biological researchers, but there might also be a great supply of biological researchers, so wages dont go above what companies or the government are willing to pay for them
Sure you can do that, but that's not what she's saying
She trying to imply that football players are more valuable than researchers
What system would be better
Capitalism isnt perfect, but it's the closest thing we have to an automatic evaluation of how much we should pay for something
Governments in the eastern bloc tried to control these things and we know how that turned out
Of course a single person who is popular like Ronaldo will get paid a lot because there dont seems to be so many people like Ronaldo
Its not like if i become a football player i will be paid a million euros
I don't think the state should have control of industries
Let's say the vaccine research industry
The state could offer a sum of money to any company that finds a vaccine for the coronavirus, this way there for sure are going to be companies willing to develop a vaccine because of the reward and the competitiveness of the market would still be there, so costs would be low
Well looking at the number of players La liga has, its not that large - 485 players, and second league is 533
So around a thousand people
Sure you can talk about how large their salaries are, but there arent that many, a LOT less than there are researchers
And btw a biologist in Spain doesn't earn 1,800 euros, from what i can find online its 3,000 euros minimum
&#x200B;
Everything you're using right now is a product of competition
In every industry, companies are competing for either your money or attention and have been doing so for a long time
So why isn't Britain offering them to an EU tour
Imperial twats lol
As you can see, Greece has kept 5x of the cargo just as safe
I guess the famous ISIS invasion of Greece missed them
It can still have being stolen as a part of its history in Greece
I love how you're questioning Greece's ability to preserve a statue under a picture where you can clearly see not one but five statues of its kind perfectly preserved
In Greece
Can I judge
Not even sure with Bulgaria's military history what atrocity I'm gonna learn about next
I mean, it's kinda your fault if you leave your car in a state that's easy to steal
What's her name
What are her political views
What are here proposed policies
These don't matter do they
..why
Because it is staged and the smoke makes the situation seem more dramatic than it actually is in real
Even if the lady in the pic happens to be a lesbian, that doesn't stop her from caring about a right that primarily impacts straight women
And it impacts her too because the right to abortion is for all women, no matter their sexual orientation
One doesn't really need to personally benefit from a certain right to care to protect it
most of those (at least in Bulgaria) say that max vaccination during a pandemic is dog shit, not to mention the measures taken to "control" it
What cause
I just learned about this on the morning news
This is heartbreaking
So bulgaria isn’t in EU now
Well played sir
I cannot believe this just happened
Didn't even realise till halfway through the song that I've been rickrolled, I'm not even mad
I fell for it 5 months later
*NordVPN intensifies*
Update, works just fine with a Bulgarian server
The fuck is with this whoosh on my comments
Why
No mercy for noobs
>Have you seen the size they wanted Bulgaria to be after we gained independence
You mean the treaty of San Stefano
At that point in time almost all of that land had a majority Bulgarian population with the exception of parts of Macedonia (Greek)
Largely thanks to all the Turks that were forced to vacate it during the Russo-Turkish war
I've just done a month touring the Netherlands in a camper (working my way around all of Europe over a few years) and The Netherlands and the Dutch are by far my favourite place in the world; I feel home sick for The Netherlands when I don't feel homesick for my native UK
If you're visiting don't bother with Amsterdam; it's become just another pretty European city, instead go East for Utrecht, Muiden, South for Hellevoetsluis, or North for Giethoorn
Naval history, amazing fortifications, beautiful mix of old and new architecture, a pretty church, lovely people, tall ships, historic Dutch barges, delicious food, awesome locals, free parking, a yatchs on the lake, even the police were cool
If the owner of the multi million dollar luxury yacht "Erica" choose to moor her there it's got to be good
The sad part is that even these jokes give her more credit, than she has
Yeah, the transparent plastic gives it a trashy view . The cat is classy enough to go above that
Who fucking won
Our first representative was a socialist lol, but he wouldn't have lived if the socialist dictatorship he lived under had their way
Actually, he witnessed a dear friend of his sacrifice himself to save him, all avoidable if it wasn't for the tyranny
I bet he was so proud to be a socialist as he sat at the open casket funeral of his burnt and mangled friend
I bet he was even more proud when he recalled about how it was very preventable
Shut the fuck up
Soviet socialism was shit, people died, Gagarin went to space as a human, not as a puppet of some commie dictator
And I sincerely hope that "soon to be Norway" isn't because you heard Americans call Scandinavia socialist, because you'll be very disappointed once you go there if that's the case
Does it really matter
More than a few Turks are epic dudes
Bro I literally don't give a shit about your country
The USA was never even mentioned lmfao, don't get your panties in a twist because we dare have a discussion where we don't jerk off the US
No, country responsible for millions of deaths bad
We both come from the Balkans, we love our war crimes, and both our countries combined still have a better track record in hundreds of Europe than the USSR did in less than a hundred
Wasn't as easily preventable
They were volunteers
Sorry for forgetting that every time a Russian takes a shit a Serbian has a meal
You're worse than one of the worst
What do you think my point is
She's still not the longest-reigning monarch in European history
That would be Louis XIV, who sat on the throne for 72 years
Kinda helps that he was crowned at the age of 4
Her reign is also shorter than that of King Rama IX of Thailand and Johann II of Liechtenstein
She'll have them all beat in 4 years, though
looks like a civ leader screen
We all know she's gonna live forever lmao
Най-накрая виждам някой друг от България
That seems like an arbitrary distinction to me
If we're going by actual political power, does that not rule out Elizabeth II
This is terrible for the truckers
I don't live in the UK but I order stuff from there through a third party shipping company because it's cheaper than a courrier like DHL
The service actually stopped accepting packages after the 19th with the last truck leaving then
The trucks usually take 7 days to get here, this last one is still in the UK 4 days later
Shit must be wild
good thing my father is in the other half of the continent and in the opposite direction

So Muslims can't draw the Prophet or God but the Devil is fair game
Talk about blatant discrimination
There needs to be reforms to Islam, if Christans and other such religious can change to live in today's society, so can Islam, and I'm pretty sure there are any abundance of sects that are more progressive but have been condemned and silenced by a extreme part of Islam
> Romania OK results
Reeeeeeeee
Bruh, Greece 2 levels above Bulgaria, Turkey, Serbia etc
Otherwise it's pretty spot on haha
I believe that switching Ukraine and Russia's colors would be most accurate
Looks about average
hey hey hey Bulgaria is in the OK graph come on
I'm not biased of course
I'd put Bulgaria in worrying results
also portuguese deadass sounds like polish/russian
Tbf Slovenia and Greece in usually in most maps and indexes way better than the rest of the Balkans though
But I agree Turkey shouldn't be in same category with us
They would have been at least orange
Compare to EU yes we have to be orange or red, but compare with Europe as a continent no we are in the correct category
Also Turkey have to be in orange category for sure
Right back at you Ireland
Hahaha, how nice of you

You get your money back long term - the health benefits are obvious, you are creating a better market for electric vehicles so there is more incentive for competition and lower prices for the consumer, if im in a neigbouring country its entirely realistic to travel to Norway to buy such a car, which could insert more money in the economy
We have the same in several cities
Works just as well
800 comments and no one has noticed that this is total BS
You can't reliably distinguish closely related ethnicities from one another like that and there is no evidence that this is actually real
Traditional gowns and braids of the Pomak village of Startsevo, Bulgaria
Cool, I would have liked a picture of the full dress, though
That is
interesting considering I am from Bulgaria and I have never heard/seen a custom for having Rapunzel level braids
Not surprising considering the mongrel that I am
ITT: DAE People saying cultural appropriation bad
Hey, sorry, couldn't find other pictures of the girl on the right in this exact dress (ran out of time), but [here's] another one of her in a different top dress that is somewhat similar
There are more photos of her on Facebook for sure (I remember seeing her in the albums from 2016-2017) that were uploaded from the [Zheravna Festival] in the exact dress that OP posted
Edit: Found more photos: [1] [2]
I think these photos are from the Zheravna festival that happens annually (not counting 2020) in Bulgaria, where people all wear traditional dress that was typical for the 19th century
All kinds of traditional dress are welcomed, though since it's a festival in Bulgaria the vast majority of people wear the clothing typical for Bulgaria
For the most part only approved photographers are allowed to take photos (modern devices like cameras  and cell phones are banned) and the photos are then upload on Facebook after the event
I posted a link to the page where you can find more photos in a comment a bit higher in the thread
I think this is from the Zheravna festival
You can find more at @photozheravnafest on FB
You can check the gallery of the [Jeravna festival of the folk costume] \- this is an annual festival celebrating the Bulgarian national garb (and not only Bulgarian
) taking place in Zheravna
As far as I remember the hair is part of the ornament
It's real hair
Basically women would save their hair, braid it and later pass it down the generations to daughters and granddaughters
I wonder if analog cameras would be welcome
I'd love to take some shots with my zenit in a place like that
I agree with this
I think it stems from white Americans having very little culture after their ancestors decided to move away/reject the culture they'd been part of for thousands of years
Black people in america have endured ethnic eradication - they never really know their origins, their ethnicities, their native languages
Colonisers took that from them and for centuries they were nameless slaves
This is the reason "black culture" exists, but white culture doesn't.
White people have the luxury of not having their skin colour tied to their origin
Every white person in america can tell you exactly what kind of european descendant they are
So being proud of their "whiteness" comes off as racism, instead of being proud of whatever their actual origins are - german, irish, polish, italian
Black american people aren't saying white people have no cultures
They're denying the existence of a unified "white culture".

Close enough to the civilized states that it might call itself one, surprisingly rich, lots of weird religious people and a desire to break stuff on days of celebration
Idk man, I'm freezing up here in Scotland
I just love British weather maps
Especially how you don't have the capitol of a 20m country but have Burgas, my hometown of 200k on the map
Sunny beach weather more important I guess
Let's cranck it up babaay
With any luck winter will be totally gone in a few years
It really sucks as it obviously shouldn't be happening but I have to admit I am enjoying all the sun and warmth we've been getting in Bulgaria
Why is this map showing our 4th largest city when other countries are either missing a city or have their capital and another
lol
Does anyone know how that would affect yield
Same down here
There are days there's no point in turning on the heating at home
If this keeps up I don't want to imagine what July will feel like
Worst of all it's dry as hell
Some rain here and there, but for the most part nothing
Where I'm at it snowed for a total of 3 times this winter and the snow barely lasted a day before melting
Me too
I hate cold so much
People downvoting you and comments related to yours are truly pathetic
This might actually be the best 'winter' of my life
Not walking around with a jacket during February would've been like a fairy tale for me before
Sure, nobody's saying it's *good* but there's nothing wrong to like it lmao
You have to admit tho, that's a pretty gangsta move

He was very badly poisoned so if the Russians don't kill him themselves, the poor conditions and the after effects of the poison may finish him off
Paradoxically, a Russia that returned Crimea to Ukraine would not be Democratic since it would be in clear violation of the Russian constitution and against the will of the people

". The fuck does that even mean and are you 12 for believing it

No, they're people of their word

I don't see how getting goods and services for cheap if you are poor is a fundamental right at all
My country's infrastructure is really depressing
This calls for an EU-wide company that should regulate this project

That's not a thing
Literally nothing to do with rights, at all
It's the definition of a privilege that you want for free
Luxembourg is an outlier so far out and so weird that giving it as a model for something like the EU shows that you oversimplify your views to the point of false equivalences not even phasing you
You don't have the right to travel because you are a worker, you have the right to spend the money you were compensated for by giving your expertise and time for whatever you wish
Do I get the right to a weekend at the Bahamas because I work 40 hours a week
The answer is obviously no
The only way for this to happen is a specialized tax, similar to how we do health care
Which BTW will cost everyone money, nothing is free
The train system is expensive, goods and services require resources and someones time
I am against such a tax because it will actually leave poor people, who are living month for month, a privilege that they will probably not be able to take advantage of(because they are poor I fail to see how the smallest expense in a holiday will help them afford said holiday or even time off) and in the end leave them worse of
By your logic I'm also entitled to a hotel as a fundamental right as well as an Xbox since well, I worked for 40 hours a week and rich people can afford it too
It's totally an absurd concept
You need to flesh out your arguments more, simply saying because I think so does not allow me to understand your position and opinion better
That doesn't cost money
At least nothing beyond buying the fuel

Next the EU functions nothing like the BeNeLux
Because it's a union of very different states and a lot more people
What works there does not work for the whole union, you give a baseless statement
The weirdest thing is that Dutch public transport is not becoming free in 2020, so I fail to see how saying BeNeLux means that free transortation is coming to Belgium and the Netherlands
So even if what you said is true, and BeNeLux is a 1 to 1 homomorphism to the EU, it does not actually support your claim
There is also a difference in infrastructure cost between public transport defined as metros and bus routes etc, and traveling between cities
I don't think all these things are as comparable to each other as you make it seem
I see no plans or push for EU wide taxation that allows free public transport, in fact, the way the current administration works, there is no framework for the EU to even impose taxes
From the EU website
>The EU does not have a direct role in raising taxes or setting tax rates
It's because of Trump's support of Poland and particularly PiS, especially against Russian interests
Of course, Trump has consistently supported Russian intrrests in the past 4 years, but these people rarely use logic
So go back to the Middle East where you belong

Population here is concerned mostly duo to the fact that our health care is almost non existent even in peaceful times and it would easily collapse if something like Italy happens here
So a lot of people are isolating themselves
Still, our cases are growing

[I still remember Trump threatening europe with terrorists] Good riddance you stupid bastard

Merkel calling out Bulgarian prime minister Boyko Borisov for wearing mask wrong
"We know what to do about COVID, just give us funds
Seems legit
And we embarrassed ourselves again
We are the joke of EU
This idiot is making our entire country look bad
Oh no, the man who has systematically been destroying every single good thing in the country over the past decade and even more is wearing his mask wrong
How horrific
Of course it's Boyko, he's a legendary meme icon in our country, something like Trump to americans
This is the most of Bulgaria I've seen in a while, and it's all bad
Make sense though
Our Fatman can't even get that thing correctly
That's why the country will be blowing up anyway
It's no secret that Бате Бойко isn't the smartest of individuals
Shes actually worried and he's so stupid he thinks shes just teasing

Nah, she usually refers to him as just 'Boyko' :D

I've heard on the news that Russia is considering to offer millitary help to Lukashenko
I would say that thats certainly a lot less than the euromaidan
I feel like the flag is more symbolic of hatred towards Lukashenko who has done everything to stop it from being used, rather than actual anti-russian sentiment, even if in the historical sense it most certainly was used as such
Anyways, the protests don't have a position on western integration, the sole EU flag in front of this massive demonstration shows that the pro-western sentiment isn't widespread, which, I'd argue, is a good thing, nobody wants a repeat of Ukraine
Looks like it's coming along great

You can tell where the Internet propaganda machine has had succes
Its more propaganda I believe
They have been filling their heads that the UK is essential to the EU, they think that we are worried tf we going to do without them even tho most eu citizens forgot about Brexit
Tbh I think they will have no deal because Eu wants to flex so no one else would think  of leaving
If they cancel Brexit it would leave them with a cheaper pound and destroyed pride
Am I the only one who fucking hates this mark
It's ugly and it gets hairs that I have to constantly plug out
Even Europe is starting to ackowledge the situation (There was a debate in the europarliament today related to the situation in Bulgaria, 2 weeks after the hearing in LIBE, in which the chief prosecutor made a lie that he called for the meeting which he didn't even attend, debunked by LIBE themselves)
Borisov just has less and less reasons to stay and the earlier he resigns the better for himself
Love you guys; so happy I returned home this month and was able to take part in these
I hope they do lead to some good changes this time
Wow this post is really interesting because in the comments you have actual Europeans supporting the protesters and then you have salty Americans - half of the Americans are supporting peaceful protests and the other half want us to burn our city
LOL
You heard of Covid
They're not all mobsters, he said yesterday that some of them are contrabandists too
Don't feel bad
The protests in Serbia were one of the things that inspired the Bulgarian ones
So  your attitude actually helped a lot
We are accustomed to protesting for months on end every few years with questionable (unfortunately) results
He's actually resigned twice already and got reelected both times
Current polling shows him winning the next election as well (by a slim margin)
Elections are in a few months anyway
I mean, if what I'm hearing is true and big boy Boyko is trying to set his deals with the Russians so nobody can reverse them after, he has all the reasons to hold onto power
After all this is the guy who already left twice during protests
Makes you wonder what's so different this time, no
> corrupt ass oligarchy
This
They are way too incompetent to be Orban
Both, although Borisov himself isn't too keen on the nationalistic speech
But the smaller party in the ruling coalition are nationalists, so they get some favors as well
Bright side - our next elections are in March 2021
BTW nice username, Outlander
Yes, the system does need to be changed and even one government with good majority can only start to undo the actions of the mafia but not destroy it
It has dug too far into Bulgarian politics
However, I also think that the protests are very important because they show that people won't tolerate being played around
And we also can't do anything useful with the current parliament
That's why people are protesting
Boyko is not the only one the protesters want to resign
There are also the chief prosecutor, the director of BNT and most importantly, the bosses of the mafia Ahmed Dogan and Delyan Peevski
We need restart of the system but that won't happen with Boyko
We need lustration of the people responsible for the mafia during the transition and we need to start from somewhere
Yep, the EU has been calling for a specific reform since 2009 - make the Prosecutor General accountable and take away his ability to stop investigations by his subordinates
The PG's role is mostly to act as an "umbrella" that protects mafia interests from any serious investigation, or just conducts botched investigations so that they fall apart in court
He left once during protests and the reason was high electricity prices, later turning political
The second time he resigned because Rumen Radev won the presidential elections not because of protests
He had a bad candidate there
These protests are directly against the mafia, the rule of law so that's how it differs
The current government is with less than 30% (both GERB and UP included) yet he's trying to waste time with grand national assembly
You're right that he has his reasons to stay in power but we're not sure what they are exactly
He could be making last deals, could be looking for someone to replace them, find a way to make sure he isn't prosecuted
But if you think about it, if he resigned earlier he could have had bigger chances to win more trust but now that he's just driving around the country and calling protesters mafia is fully incompetent and won't turn out well for him
That's not everything
You're forgetting that he bought the europarliament too and most of the foreign media which costs quite a lot too

We also have a ton of Chinese food shops and we don't post stuff about China, right
Are you dumb or something
Even if there are more Turks in Germany that does not mean that turkey is a European country
Your point has nothing to do with the subject and does not change the fact that Turkey is not a European country
But what are they opposing or what to happen
Such western superiority, wow

Seriously, climate change denial is crossing a line
Fucked up immigration policies and threatening to ruin relationships with major political powers is bad
At the end our lives are momentary, and we'll be just another era of idiots even if we die in the process, big deal, but dooming the planet is just a dickmove, and something that obviously doesn't concern the most powerful man on Earth
Edit: Weirdly I got several replies with the exact sentiment in under five minutes, from different users as well
Yes, we are not destroying the planet, but ourselves and the flora and fauna
I agree, it's an important distinction to make
Also, from browsing some of the pro-Trump subreddits and comment sections, I see a lot of whataboutism and pointing fingers
Yes, almost every country on Earth has to improve a lot, that's the whole idea of this agreement
Also, it may not be perfect, but literary all but two countries agreed to it, before Trump decided to do what his father never could and pull out
It shows an ambition to solve *the biggest* problem humanity has ever faced, and threatening not to cooperate because it doesn't help the US economy or the "poor" American workers (not that he cares about them) is just a pisstake
We deserve it, the future generations don't.

I'm form Bulgaria and I pay 15 euros for 1gbps internet
I would link my speedtest but I'm too lazy to get out of bed and go to the other room and use the Ethernet cable
On wifi I get about 450-500mbps
How much do you download with ?
I pay 5 euro for 100 mbps LOL
Wtf and that's in the capital
> If you go to some african countries with 100€ you can basically own the entire city
what are you on about
30 leva for 1gb
Which provider
A1 but I think the offer was temporary and has expired since It's no longer on their website
It's technically 40 BGN for just 1gbps internet
However if you get it with the lowest TV package which separately costs 10 BGN it's still 40 BGN total so I get the internet for 30 and the TV for 10 either way
Personally I don't watch TV but my mom wants to have TV when she comes visit and I was planning on getting some basic TV plan anyway so it's a win/win for me
Edit: Nevermind
The offer is still up, I just wasn't looking at the right place:
Looks like a bargain but I've heard some bad things about A1
I completely forgot that coverage might be an issue
I live in Sofia so I kinda don't have to worry about it since a substantial part of the city has fibre coverage
Not gonna lie
I used to have a lot of problem with them back when I was on Megalan, than Megalan was bought my M-tel and then M-tel was bought by a1 but when I switched to fibre I've had literally 0 issues which happened about a year and a half ago

We still have to make sure this doesn't pass in September
I understand that this law will help artist such as musicians to get better payment and royalties by tech giants, but this **should NOT come at the expense of free speech, sharing of information, free fan-made creation and memes
YOU DON'T TOUCH THE MEMES
They are the soul of the Internet
VI VON
I just found out about this yesterday
The news channels in my country haven't said a thing about it
But I'm gonna make sure I spread the word about it till September
I get that the whole "save the memes" thing kind of ended up backfiring, but I think the whole point of it was to show that the proposal was so ridiculously broad that it would end up effectively banning memes, or at least make posting them such a headache that most people wouldn't even bother
I mean, could you imagine having to go through a roided up version of Youtube's Content ID every single time you try to post a meme
Problem was, of course, that there are a lot of people could not give less of a shit about memes
In the future we should probably focus more on the effects it would have on social media and wikipedia, which FAR more people use and care about
Fan content in general, too
They probably just don't understand how the internet works
We know that automatic filters are really, really bad at discerning what actually constitutes copyright infringement, but if you're just an old guy who can barely send an e-mail you'd probably think "check uploaded things for copyright infringement
Sounds good to me
I don't get what these internet pirates are so worked up about
I mean, to a point I agree with you, but the entire point of a party is to say "Everyone in this group of people will push the following issues, vote for us if you're interested
Yes, of course
That was part of what I was trying to say
Obviously there are actual reasons why this could look good on paper, espacially since this contains a lot more than just articles 11 & 13
But internet culture is in many ways inherently derivative, and I don't just mean memes
I'll also openly admit I'm biased, since I generally have problems with copyright law, anyway
I'm just saying that the idea that an automated filter can accurately determine the legality of something or that a link tax would lead to increase in revenue and not the opposite can only make sense to someone who barely uses the internet
Good job neighbors, fuck 'em, send them straight to jail
This is so good to see
Greece went through a lot and it is during such times that nazism rises
I'm really happy to see the people reject it
What about not using this crude form of whataboutism
> But all this time from 1938 to 1939, until the very beginning of the  war, the USSR called on European countries to unite and prevent a  possibility of war
No one listened to them but tried to gain personal profit by entering  into alliances with the Nazis
The USSR is the last to conclude a  similar treaty
Declaration and frontier pact is a little difference than alliance
The USSR agreed to supply the Nazis with vital materials and divide Eastern Europe between the two of them
Britain and France did a lot of dumb moves at the time but nothing like that
Hitler very much wanted to ally with Britain but the Brits refused
And gee, I wonder why no one trusted Stalin
maybe because he had a penchant for stabbing "allies" in the back
Hypocritical
Can't you just have a day to hate the worst regimes that have been created
They outweigh the deaths of what capitalism has done
And even if you want a day for it this is not the place you try to get it
It's like a person advertising a funeral of someone at another person's funeral
What system would you propose to capitalism, no one says it's great, it's the best we have
I agree if we maybe switch the focus on profits to well being it will be better
Facism caused WW2, Cold war was between 2 ideologies
And I will take capitalism instead of communism any day
Imagine having not only little money but when you go to the store the shelves to be almost empty
Imagine being forced to work for free now . Imagine waiting to by TV even if you have the money

Can only imagine the level of education in Norway if people there would rather study in a 3rd world country like the US rather than Norway
It's a post shitting on the US while admitting that many students prefer traveling there over other places
It's a fake editted post regarding how the US is a 3rd world country that has irony in it because it basically admits that students do travel to the US(making it not so much a 3rd world country) rather than staying in Norway
Yet people still migrate in mass to the US

Ukraine at the very least knew that the rebels had access to a Buk system and didn't do anything to notify airlines flying over the war zone about this
Now it's probably speculation whether they expected or hoped something like this to happen, but at the very least there was gross negligence
Incidentally the rebels which shot down the plane though that the air space had been closed - which it had been but well below the height at which airliners usually fly
So we're experiencing a Euricane

Top searches in Bulgaria (in Bulgarian) currently: most of the results are "how do I sew my own mask" or "how to stay safe during COVID/grippe" and then
3rd one is "how do I know if I have magic"
7th one is "how do I make my own sanitizer"
12th one is "how do I force a period"
Top searches of all time in Bulgarian:
most of them are literally just "how do i", with nothing else added (top one is just "how") and then there's "how do I force a period", "how do I get pregnant", "how do I kiss"
Top search of all time in Bulgaria in English: how do I look
so there's that

No, the reason people do not live in cities is because of price

Bulgaria got severely lectured about building the south pipeline so we abandoned it in 2014, next thing we know Germany is approving the North one and saying we should build go back to building the south one, you know after turkey already takes the fucking deal

I wish them good luck with these protests
Remember that even if a protest doesn't succeed with its most ambitious  goals it can still change things for the better by forcing the government to tone down some of its unpopular measures or abandon future plans to make things worse
I hope they succeed
I'm tired of half the parties in my parliament being paid by Russian gas money, and caring only about what Putin and his origarch gang say, rather about what bulgarian people say

Bulgaria and Serbia support this protest
We're doing the same thing now and we shouldn't stop until we win the fight

It's always been interesting to me how we trade some sharp words or expel Russian diplomats or something every couple of years for one reason or another, yet relations never deteriorate beyond that

HOW THERE THEY

Bombing of Yugoslavia
Russians saw it as the western powers ignoring it completely when deciding how to handle the situation, circumventing the UN security council and using NATO as an aggressive alliance
Ever since then they have been mistrustful of both America and its European allies
I mean back then it was the logical choice
Russia was a humiliated and ruined great power
Who could have thought they'd come back so fast and be so malicious
Yes, but by their perspective you have been much more of a friend to them than us in EU/NATO

Serbia has been much more of a friend to Russia in the last 100 years than us or the Baltic states

Fun fact: This summer Greece made it mandatory to have a PCR test to enter there and there was kilometers of cars waiting at the Greek border, but not trying to visit our seaside (even though a PCR test costs ~€60 here)
I really hope they improve on these things in next year, because we could have much better tourism than now

Hahaa this about Macedonia and Bulgaria is true
I don't want them to be a country, because they only steal from other countries

Bulgaria and Macedonia are the same nation (at lest some years ago) so I don't think that they should fight each other

As a Bulgarian I feel pretty embarrassed by our role in this one
Our prime minister - whom we have been protesting against for 2 weeks now - is bragging all around how we got more money than last time even though the overall budget is lower
I can assure you that if nothing changes here, most of these funds will not be spent transparently but instead sink into a circle of businesses close to the government
It also feels pretty undeserved getting this money in view of the state of the rule of law here, which is virtually non-existent
So it feels like we're like some kind of happy beggars, graced by the undeserved kindness of rich EU nations
Edit: I do appreciate the fact that EU leaders have been able to reach an agreement, though, it felt like a pretty tough fight
I have lived through all Bulgarian governments since communist regime, and current one is actually the least harmful one
No wonder people repeatedly vote for it in the last 10 years
Despite some scandals, there were many improvements in infrastructure and also we are one of the countries in EU with the least debt (  - at least they are not taking debt to loot it, so I hope the majority of the new grants will be used again for infrastructure, energy efficiency (a lot of apartment buildings were insulated with government aid in recent years)
I would not be surprised that despite protests, majority of voters will again vote for Borisov to avoid risk of getting someone way worse again
I am excited to see young people on protests trying to improve our country
But we 40-year olds have to take care of so many things (children, old parents, etc, expenses) that we are just happy to have some stability (and not having banks fail)
Couldn't have worded it better
Edit: I forgot how to properly write in English
Not only that, my unicorn friend, but the money sinking into mafia pockets will actually make things worse here
The oligarchy will just become more powerful and entrenched
We are still the poorest country in the EU, the runt, the laughing stock of the whole union and this guy is bragging as if he won a football match
With actually competent leaders we could be so much better after 13 years of membership
Yeah, someone has to be the poorest, and it was probably always going to be us, the quality of life and healthcare could have been so much better
But hey, our guy builds highways, eh
Highways so good the asphalt probably won't last a decade
We definitely don't deserve the money because they'd just go into the pockets of oligarchs
Personally I wouldn't mind EU sanctions if there are misuses of funds in Bulgaria, and there sure as hell are
I emphatically and vehemently disagree with such attitude
Firstly, the 1997-2001 government, corrupt as it was, brought the country of deep crisis, made economic reforms which in spite of flawed privatization led to a decade of unprecedented GDP and income growth, opened the road to EU membership, switched the currency and monetary mechanisms which guaranteed currency and banking system stability, built (I believe, need to check) more highways than Borisov during any of his mandates, without any comparable EU funding and without bragging and holding ceremonies for newly completed every 10 km
Also, that government, corrupt as it was, was **IN NO FUCKING WAY** nearly as corrupt as the current one
No private business was taken away and gifted to friendly oligarchs, unlike the lottery and the "Eight Dwarfs" recent affair
The Chief Public Prosecutor wasn't essentially a player on the government's team who could be used against any opposition or businessman that the government doesn't like
I don't think media has been controlled by the government and its friendly oligarchs since the end of communism
What we have now is not stability, it is a slow but steady decay and desintegration of the state
Today they are hitting large and middle businesses, tomorrow it may well be you and me, unless you're on friendly terms with someone in power
If this government doesn't go away, or if GERB get reelected, most of the young people supporting the protests right now are going to leave the country and not come back
Ok fair point, in my language the word that translates as 'brag' doesn't mean that what one claims about himself is not true, if that's the case with English, I should have used another word
Maybe 'boasting'?
Which is why we are trying to ги изринем.
Which is also why it seems to me that if the current protests don't reach their goals, most of the younger participants in them will not be staying here much longer
Maybe Kostov and some other early Prime ministers did well, but the situation left after communism was just too bad
You could be right about that
Media like [Capital
bg] and [Dnevnik
bg] are against government
BTV is owned by a foreign company
And I see all the bad things about the government on most Bulgarian media (like apartamentgate, etc) so I do not think media is oppressed
I watched the "Eight Dwarfs" last week
If it is true it is indeed extremely bad
And I would support prosecuting all involved and Geshev should resign in this case
Unfortunately only proof was the story of this businessman and I do not believe him 100%. His actions are not very logical
He constantly agrees to sign ANYTHING he is given by the corrupt prosecutor like a moron (if he were such moron how he made such a big business)
And why did not he take his family feud to court and instead went to the mafia
Could he be the bad guy and not his family as he claims
I liked how Geshev started to prosecute several rich oligarchs (something unseen till now)
Could this be in fact just a plot to take these businesses from the owners and give them to Geshev's own friends
Yes it is possible, but I do not know for now
We need to see what happens to these businesses after their owners are stripped of them
Actually instead of giving the Bozhkov's multimillion gambling business to someone else, GERB and Patriots voted a law that forbids private gambling (BSP voted against
What a surprise - if they were really the mafia (as protesters claim) why dissolve such a lucrative business instead of stealing it
And Geshev's efforts were in vain - what a pity :)
What  bothers me is that all this activity - Dwarves, Rosenec, Borisov room photos - happened exactly when Bozhkov was charged
It almost looks like he organized all these things
I do not know what is actually true and cannot form an opinion at the moment
When we do know I am all for wrong doers to go to prison
Even if Geshev is organizing all these bad things, I still do not understand why the government should also resign - what did Borisov do wrong
(phone and photo compromats could be fabricated)
Elections are in 7 months
Why should Radev/BSP rule for 3 months
They always do a lot of harm to Bulgaria
What about the rights of all those people who voted for GERB + United Patriots
4 million people voted for them
Now several thousand protest and government should resign
Democracy means that majority rule
If 1
4 million come to the streets to protest, then  the situation will be quite different and resignation should be immediate
Otherwise why bother to go and vote in elections if later 10 000 people can demand resignations and change the government as they wish
To be fully honest, I am ashamed by some of the things Borisov says from time to time
But I think he is not a bad person and actually wants to improve Bulgaria
Yup, if we don't turn the trend into a positive one, I'll probably leave in 2021
currently this is no place to run a business or have children
How did they give us more money when the overall budget is smaller
Well I guess it's EU solidarity at play
Bulgaria is the least developed and needy nation, and also it's a pretty small economy
The increase is only 1 billion euro which is by no means tremendous as compared to the entire deal
But it's a fact that it's there
Misleading - what about the offshore territories

That's such a shallow view of how a democracy as large as the EU operates
Firstly, if the average voter doesn't understand how the system they participate in works, the problem isn't with your average voter, but with the system you have in place
It's not a matter of education or political engagement, it's a matter of complexity level
Secondly, that's a matter of "is" vs "ought". EU citizens don't understand how the EU operates
You say they ought to understand
The first part of that statement is a fact, the second part is just wishful thinking
Those are two very different things
You can't sit around, arguing that the problem is that people "don't understand". Newsflash—no matter the importance of "people understanding" is, no matter their responsibility, in the foreseeable future voters won't begin to understand how the EU operates
You better accept that, and don't vote stupid regulations that alienate EU citizens from the institutions of the European Union
TL;DR: Your comment is how you create EU skeptics
Yeah, there isn't exactly a whole lot of copy right protection down here
Pretty much everyone I've ever met has pirated things
Movies and TV especially
> Same thing happens in every country, but sure
Jesus fucking Christ, would you stop repeating that already
It is simply *not true*. It doesn't happen in every country, and even when it happens, it is nowhere near the astronomical scale it happens in the EU
Not to mention that *even if it happened* everywhere else, your argument boils down to pure whataboutism
News flash—the system is broken elsewhere as well
Gee, thanks, I didn't know
We DON'T need a broken record telling us that
That is ***NO EXCUSE*** for what just happened today
And even with the system broken elsewhere, people can exert much more control over their national governments than over whatever this voluptuous, amorphic beast the EU has become
What a myopic shit propaganda regurgitator you are
> But it's still not the EUs faut
No matter how many people think that, no matter the reason
Yet you fail to provide an argument to backup your claim
The truth is, EU is not just "an international framework", as you claim it to be in your other comments
It is very much what the average voter perceives it to be, and currently voters perceive it to be a corrupt lobbyist machine, incapable of solving any real issues
To put it in other words, the EU is precisely what "many people think" it to be
> And I'm doing my part to explain how it isn't.
No, you're not
You are going around telling people they are wrong, and that they shouldn't be mad at the EU for one of the worst decisions the EU has ever made
That is how you create euroskeptics
And, listen, even if we agree the EU is nothing but a framework which corrupt politicians exploit, none of that would have been possible without that framework
It is that framework that enables directives such as this one to be passed; that framework that relegates too much national sovereignty into the hands of a corrupt few
The corrupt politicians aren't the disease, but the symptoms
And believe me when I tell you, as an Eastern European, they aren't the only symptom
The EU needs to change, and needs to change *fast*.
What part of "but what about other countries that use a similar system" isn't pure whataboutism
> One simple analogy: The Bulgarian state passes a shitty law
Who do you blame
> The state of Bulgaria
Or the politicians
Over the last 30 years all kinds of shitty laws have been passed in Bulgaria
Politicians of all walks of life and all ends of the political spectrum have enacted 'shitty regulations' of all kinds
Plain and simple, it is obvious the system allows for corrupt politicans to exist
You might cut out the weeds, but the root of the problem is the system which allows for corruption to exist
I blame the state
Bear in mind, I am no delusional revolutionary who just wants to tear down systems and revel in the ensuing chaos
I don't want to *tear down* the EU, I want to *change* it
And I want drastic, sweeping changes, but none of the changes I desire would serve to undermine the basic principle of the EU—that is, an union of States with one common market, freedom of movement, and an unified European idea
But if I had to decide right now between 20 more years with the same "EU framework" that you talk about, and the dissolution of the EU, I'd chose the later
Corrupt politicians have allowed the EU to become an absolute disgrace, and today the "union" reached the lowest point in its history
You are hopelessly brainwashed, aren't you
The choice between a lesser evil and no evil must always be the no evil
If people say they "want" reforms, but prefer what they currently have over nothing, then nothing will change
If they prefer nothing over the EU, then the EU will change
Amazing

Masks are obligatory and very widely worn in the Metro, trams, busses or other public transport

Western Europeans: Win war, leave the victims to be de facto conquered by a genocidal maniac

Come on now, lads, no need to pretend that Eastern Europe is nice but there's also no reason to pretend that you don't know the reason :)
Bulgaria always the strongest
Why does everyone think it has anything to do with religion
People against same sex marriage are a lot more than people who are actually religious
But that might be the case only here, I don't know
Communists were surprisingly discriminatory for people who supposedly wanted the ultimate form of equality
Oh yeah, sorry, the government was appointed by blatant election fraud supported by the EU
That better
Balanced is not misused at all
Balanced doesn't mean good, you're applying your own biases to the word
[51% of Bulgarians identify as religious, the least in the Balkans
] (
[39% support equal gay rights, 93% of parents will be outraged if their child has a same sex partner]
It sure has same effect, but it is not the one and only cause, like people make it to be
I don't know many deeply religious peoples in my country but the few that I know are very involved with various kind of charities, community organizations, nature preserving and non have denied science or hold really conservative values
I know many are not like that but just calling them stupid or unstable is quite unfair
Even if they are they are probably still doing a lot more than most people, me (non-religious) and maybe even you
So maybe understand that there are nuances in this world
Couldn't care less

This looked to me quite a bit [like the Bulgarian flag] I took it in Armenia though
Well if you believe "Not in the 30s it wasn't" is funny enough and delivered properly
I think your attempt failed so not that it's too soon - just not funny
I think it's more that the European people (and American) have failed Ukraine (to which they obviously have no obligations)
The EU can't do much when besieged by other crises and when people don't want confrontation with Russia in the interest of "stability".
If there were big protests everywhere in solidarity with Ukraine and calls for the governments to do something, more would have been done
Of course no one should be blamed that this didn't happen
That's too much, but it would have been nice if it happened

Goddamnit that's how the cordyceps infection started
Omg a politician does something normal
i dunno i personally wouldn't have a problem with a politician using a car, just like i wouldn't have a problem with anyone else doing so
Tbh if it wasn't for your current situation with the toxic rulers I think you'd have been already in the EU
It's just that a lot of powerful lobbies don't want a united Europe
Those aren't "British" funds, the moment they give them to the EU, they're EU funds
*disappointed Bulgarian sigh*
Although Bulgaria is having a nuclear power plant, it still produces ~50% of it's energy from coal, why ?
So we're the only EU country where coal has grown over this period
Damn
IIRC We screwed ourselves over with the contracts with the fossil plants
We basically can't touch them until they start to be up for renewal in like 2025
This is screwing the rest because we can't shut them down and we only consume a finite amount of power
Hell we have excess to sell
Now this is a real protest
Not the pathetic 1000 people - first to gobble up Russian anti-government propaganda and pretend to be "the entire nation"
I felt bad that we're sticking out on the Balkans (except for Turkey), but then I saw Bulgaria is at 25% and Greece is at 24
9%.  We're not fat alone

...but the richest 1% is way more wealthier than the rest, and the middle class in Sweden has a better standard of living than the other middle class
That's because Reddit doesn't load all the comments
Sort by new and you'll see at least a hundred triggered people talking about rape and ignoring everything else
Funny thing is because Sweden has the loose definition of rape that they have it's actually impossible to compare them to other countries
My friend is living in Sweden and he described the amazing heating systems many houses there have
Swedes seem to have figured it out about heating
Italy wtf man you literally fought on the nazi side how do you not remember
How do you deny the whole thing happened
We have tons of pictures and documents from the time, countless witness testimonies, including people that were in the camps and are still alive, mass graves, the buildings
It was documented by both the Germans and the invading Russian and American armies
Neither of those governments denies the Holocaust (unlike i.e. the Armenian genocide)
What more proof does a denier need, a time machine
I can understand someone denying the magnitude, or the reasoning behind the whole thing or whatever other aspect of the Holocaust due to antisemitic beliefs, but deny the whole thing even happened
That's even weirder than the "moon landing was fake" conspiracy
>Another example that always fascinates me is the perception in France of  who helped the most in ending the war during WWII
That's a very disappointing data set
The first poll is in 1945 when literally half of the French population is supporting some kind of socialism but the second is in 1994, after the USSR itself had collapsed
It would be incredibly interesting to see how it changed during the Cold War, especially in such key moments like 1968 and the 80s when the French socialist party adapted more "right-wing" economic policies
Coming from the other side of the iron curtain, I remember my father complaining how before 1989 he war was presented as almost 100% Soviet effort with no mention of things like the North African campaign and the war in the far east

I learned on QI that death of cyclists went up after the invention of th seatbelt
People who feel safe in their cars with their ABS, seatbelts and other safeties drive more recklessly
Death tolls on the roads were decreasing until the mid 1980s.
The person driving safest would be the one most afraid about their well being and dying
We people are selfish and stupid like that
Peaceful protests are boring and that's the truth
Well I just went on youtube and everything that is from Bach is playable so I don't know what you're talking about
In Bulgaria at least it wasn't allowed to build churches higher than an ottoman soldier on a horse
So they built them 70% underground with only the top and entrance at ground level
So these churches are real, and while I cannot be 100% sure about the rule, but I also don't see any other reason for the weird churches
The truth is that he did it on purpose, because he knows his fellow asocial countrymen would love it
I bet he played some Simon & Garfunkel too
Knowing how much air governing bodies hate fun, this is pretty great
One of my biggest gripes with Bulgarian politics is that there is no individual will amongst the MPs
Each one votes for what they've been told to vote for
Basically it's like having a dictator in charge
To think that the chain reaction started my some dudes from the secret services pushing some other political dudes away from state property which is free for all
ok, this thing won't go our way without violence
the pig was also cool
and few others
we **need** a blood bath
I felt the urge to just say that not all 7 million of us are part of these protests (in fact is a very small percentage of the population) that do
I'm not saying there's no corruption, and we shouldn't express our *rights* in the democratic process - but that these protests began after a legitimate investigation concerning our president having classified documents in his posesion - while not having the respective military clearance
He WAS a military general, but is now a president (and out presidency is nothing like USA's) There really are *many* layers to what's currently happening, which are buried under the simple "they corrupt - we protest"
Setiha se nai setne
You wish, ha
Seriously, most of the people are actually 20-25 yr old, so they have been living in the EU most of their conscious life
It is EU values such as democracy, freedom and rule of law that have led them to rebel now
So the protesting crowd (by far the larger part of it) represents the most pro-EU constituency here
I remember you recently had some pro-choice protests which were among the most inspiring protests in Europe I remember from recent years
This is where Lucio boops you off the map
Dude I feel like this was the longest winter ever
The restrictions added a lot of "winter" to the winter if you know what I mean
EU's efforts are wasted on Serbia tbh
Funny how China comes in, gives no aid, provides some small (relatively to European ones) investments that are also predatory and gets 10 times more goodwill from that
BEtter present some fucking proof for this
Because Serbia has ridiculously new and quality infrastructure her EU members don't have
Smells like bullshit EU propaganda
> This hypocrisy and ungratefulness is actually generated from the top
This is one of their president's tantrums against the EU
Totally
It's crazy how Vucic  marketed himself as pro-EU to Serbs and foreigners  when he doesn't act the part
In recent years he even received a sort of order of friendship from Putin
Looking at what Putin does to countries that try to join  the EU I can't imagine he'd be giving orders of friendship to a guy that's helping Serbia join it
Serbia is part of China's "Belt and Road" initiative, and CCP are exploiting that fact to the max
Few counties dare to speak about faulty testing kits, fake N95, medical equipment with quality of toilet paper, or the fact that the "free" donations from China have to be actually purchased (plus signing political deals with China)
Great for our neighbor Serbia, my country (Bulgaria) is next
> This image is comparing apples to oranges
It's comparing what people see as foreign investments ("aid") to actual aid in economic terms
Investment is not aid
It's a way of making money
And the EU has invested many times more than just 1
8 billion in Serbia
Yeah, that's more or less it
It sucks though because it's not   objective, cause it's widespread and because it's not some harmless little myth but something big that actually affects important political decisions and ends up hurting our chances at prosperity
> It is not that simple, friendly connection of Serbia with China (and with African countries if that matters) is older than EU, and Serbia does get at least some international support from China
Serbians do have positive feelings about Chinese
so what
Aren't there other countries you have long diplomatic relations with
India, Morocco, Argentina, etc
I'm sure there must be some but that doesn't automatically make you relations better does it
In Bulgaria I've heard the Chinese investment promoters say the same: we have long diplomatic relations, everyday people in China totally know about Bulgaria and like it very much, blah blah
They're just making up stuff to hype their "investments". And saying general nice stuff because that's what diplomats do
Google Obama saying country X "punches above its weight". Same shit from China but worse
>the only difference with China is that China is more transpatent about their expectations
China is the last country to be transparent with something
Is it not enough they're pretending to be doing anyone a favour with their investments that are actually loans paid to Chinese companies
People don't seem to realise how great of a business this is for China
Imagine you had a rich friend that loaned you 10k euros
But you had to return them with interest
And you were only allowed to spend the money for buying things in your friend's supermarket
So you friend gets the money back immediately
and then again when you return the loan
And if you didn't repay the sum you friend  got your car as collateral
That's what  China is doing
It's making crazy money from its loans
It's basically a social program for Chinese workers and companies that someone else pays for
China is not the one doing you a favour by investing in you with such  terms, if anything China owes YOU for giving it such nice opportunities
I'm sure Western governments would love to do the  same things as China but let's face it if they tried everyone would criticise it as neocolonialism
>Additionally, event if that is all free money it is not even close to amount Serbia lost and is losing on the actions of EU
Like amount of educated people that left
C'mon as if it's EU's fault for letting Serbs immigrate to it
What is it supposed to do, ruin itself to the point no one would want to move there
That's not just in Serbia
If you want to solve this issue make better EU rules and enforcement
We are all eagerly watching the new EU prosecutor
Did Mongolia pay for the project
If not then it's aid, just less ethical or effective as aid might be if you let Mongolia do the project itself
Of course  that's not perfect either as corrupt countries may simply pocket the money without doing the project properly
That's aid then, no
If you had sent them physical goods like food (not that they need it) or medical equipment wouldn't that be aid
You just sent them lamp post aid
Don't get me wrong, it's somewhat unethical and it is sorta similar to questionable Chinese investments (except China makes you pay for having their companies work in your country), but it's still  aid by definition
Could be better aid

> It seems like you can't really achieve change just by peacefully protesting and letting yourself be beaten
No, if the dictatorship is too confident and powerful it can withstand civil unrest without giving an inch
The only peaceful way to end such a regime is by somehow convincing the majority of people to strike
The violent ways are quite a few but ughh
yeah I am not going to encourage people to do that shit from behind the computer screen lmao
Defensive organizations like NATO, or economic ones like the EU are the future
If we work together, we are quite a lot stronger
Oh happy day from one union to another
I remember the millitary bases with US trucks and equipment in my small town village with goats and farmers as a kid
And of course the "intruders will be shot on sight" signs
only in English
Screw NATO , screw the Russians , screw Europe
All we got from this was brain drain and importing shitty food from Greece the same of which we grow ourselves far better in quality but send to Germany
Do you really think anyone would give a shit about Georgia if it meant a world war
no its based
Defensive as in like I've explained this over 3 times now
Those conflicts are too fucking complicated to boil it down as simply
I particularly disagree with the Yugo one
As the serbians were operating concentration camps, committing an impressive amount of war crimes to croats, bosniaks and the such
They were also murdering the peace keeping forces of the UN
I condemn the bombings, they were absolutely unacceptable, but so was the Serbian conduct
This is war mate
It's a grey middle
There is no good or bad side
All we can hope for is that a conflict like that doesn't happen ever again
Disregarding a few diplomatic blunders and the convoluted administration, the EU is quite good
I'm happy with it
The EU makes Europe a very strong power in international affairs, be it economic ones, political ones or social ones
Yeah you are right
> we literally give away billions of Euros each year to EU
Even without it being a requirement though your government already gives a lot more  to international aid   than to the EU budget
You don't notice that cause you've decided to do it but it puts into perspective that EU contributions really aren't that big
Plus since you're connected to the EU economies you support you also benefit from your own transfers to them, not so much  from international ones
Most importantly though the benefits of the Single Market for everyone are much bigger than EU budget contributions
[The UK has already lost more money from Brexit than its cumulative multi-decade EU contributions  ] and the whole thing has barely even started
Bulgaria was hit quite hard by refugees trying to go for Western Europe
But financial support and stability is the point of the EU
To make every participant strong, for the greater good
To forget pity personal conflicts
To make sure that, what we take now is given back to you in the future
To me, the EU having power over Bulgarian laws is actually beneficial, as Bulgaria being a post socialist "Republic" has incredible problems with administration and law making processes
Problems not fixed after 30 years because of the disgustingly corrupt government
However, I completely understand you not wanting to spend your money in a developing country as such
Ultimately, it's better for us all, but you have your own arguments and I can't say anything to that
>International aid and EU member fee is not the samething, at least it shouldn't be
No but I don't see why you're okay with paying international aid for others (one of the most generous countries for that) but then not smaller aid for Europeans, where additionally lots of  your money gets back to you
In Bulgaria  it's sometimes Austrian companies that renovate public spaces, Spanish ones build roads, French ones supply machines for factories, German ones build the metro, etc
And when we get richer, thanks in part to EU funds, we get to consume a lot more Western goods, stimulating their economies again
I can understand if you wish to be in the EU but not pay anything to other members
But exiting the EU because it costs money would  be a poor financial choice
You get a lot of benefits from trade aswell
International affairs are a lot more complicated than that
By being in the EU, Sweden gains a lot more from other countries
For example, Britain has lost more money in revenue since Brexit, than what it had spent on Europe in all it's years on the EU
You can't only get benefits
What ends up happening is that by everyone spending relatively little, they get a lot more back over time
And this is just the economic side on a very basic level
Point is, the EU gives europeans power and influence, while helping literally everyone in a way
I always liked to say kill one bullet with two rabbits due to how well it rhymed (or flowed I guess) in Bulgarian
Why is NE Bulgaria always depicted as speaking turkish on these maps
Don't get me wrong, there's a big Turkish minority here, but *I am from the region,* I can assure you the Turkish language is still not the majority language, and that's by an absolutely astonishingly huge margin

Вечна памет, thank you for taking us among the stars
And Bulgaria
If you ask our ruling party and the majority of their voters, this ranking and especially our glorious 111th position is a fabrication of the West because they hate Bulgaria and are jealous of the progress we've had
I'm not kidding, our press is *that bad*. Some people genuinenly believe that
haha, Boyko is the boss
and some say he is pushing for europe, democracy and other trendy words
oh no what have we done again
Damn
rip bulgarian press freedom
BRUH
Government-connected oligarchs bought most of the major media in Bulgaria in the last few years and installed puppets in the government owned media, who fired a lot of the good journalists that were working there
And it seems all major parties are in the same boat
It will be very hard to change something here, and it is getting harder every day
Press freedom in Bulgaria is probably going to become even worse in the near future
And yes, there are big protests here against corruption and oligarchy
We can still hope, at least
Well
Fuck
Nice
Е браво бе
Interesting but how do you measure that
Yup
It's fine, this ranking barely gets a mention in the mainstream media
Only the "untrustworthy, oligarch-owned media that aims to totally discredit our glorious government and the wonderful progress of Bulgaria" talk about this placement
Yup, things are that bad
Part of why tens of thousands of us are in the streets everyday
In spite of the pandemic
Yes, sadly
I hope this explains it a little better why so many Bulgarians are protesting every day all over the country
Wanna upvote you but you have 111 points right now and I find that to be very, very appropriate
Yeaaaah, you are talking out of your ass
> The possibility of criminalizing “insulting the state or its leaders” is again being discussed at high levels
every commie dream
true story
Really
[Here] is how the most watched media tries to discredit RSF
For people not speaking Bulgarian - RSF says in their report about Bulgaria that critical media is often under attack by the state and is discredited by judicial system and faces constant pressure such as asset freezing
In an attempt to save face, the video shows our pro-government media's (the most watched one) "response" to those claims - that this judicial attacks are due to "money laundering allegations" and bullshit like that
Allegations that never made it to court by the way
Because they are a complete fabrication
geshev fabricates evidence
boyko pays people to act stupid so that will spark the fire of protesters being not peaceful and they can unleash fury on them
2 guys got the brutal police beating that no one is talking about
I'm pretty sure if it wasn't for the people and cameras yesterday, those other 2 guys would have been kidnapped and beaten
Boyko is in mafia mode
I don't know if we are winning by being dumb slaves or not
Power from the mafia is taken only by blood
In my eyes Boyko declared war 2 times so far + those cops should be dead by now
Today, protest again
every day more epic than the last
like osman oktay said they will do anything to spark riots as excuse to lock everyone, shut down the country, no protest
they tried the ethnical approach
they will try more very soon
There were a few front-page posts from the protests im the last few days
Maybe you've missed them if you don't browse this sub daily
> majority of their voters, this ranking and especially our glorious 111th position is a fabrication of the West because they hate Bulgaria and are jealous of the progress we've had
This part is pure bullshit
Everyone knows about our press freedom and no one belives that shit
[Here is a comment thread from reddit from the last time this was posted
] Not everyone believes that but you can see a few Bulgarian redditors essentially claiming that we should be placed much higher and questioning the ranking
You can find similar comments every time this ranking is posted
Search for yourself if you don't believe me - this ranking has been posted many times

Uk wants to go on trading with EU as it is now
But does not want to: - be subjected to the same rules, standards and Regulations as the rest of EU, to be under the European Court of justice, to let other EU nationals to move freely on UK, to pay contributions ot EU
Basically, UK wants to eat the cake, every day, and EU to send 27 more cakes, every day
Interestingly, in Bulgaria we also use them for that
I have doubts about the Balkans where it’s says the average is around 30

You're going down the Weimar path and I assume you know what happened at the end of it
Homosexuality as in marriage or cohabitation is NOT legal in Bulgaria
1968 is the year the current and currently very outdated Penal code was introduced
This probably takes the lack of crimiminalisation laws to mean legalisation, which it's not
I specifically avoid saying "decriminalisation", because that mean that means that the powers that be decided something was no longer a crime
In this case there was no such sentiment
The thought process was - homosexuality was a crime that happened in  the capitalist burgueouase and in the glorious Communist state it doesn't happen, so it shouldn't be punished

Oh so you think 16% is low
Bulgaria's is 10% and has a health system and roads to match
Taxation has nothing to do with what our hospitals and roads look like
If anything because of the rampant corruption and amazing incompetency  a low taxation level is preferred
A person is more efficient at distributing his income than any central authority and can better match his needs than any government can predict or react to changes in that preference
Would you prefer to have a 40% tax
Imagine getting 1000 lev and only seeing 600 of it, but not only do you have less money, everything is more expensive now, cause corporate tax is higher, that means you have less money,higher bills and higher prices
Yeah sounds amazing
Bulgaria does not need more money, we are running a surplus,we need to actually spend more, borrow more and stimulate our economy
Increase of efficiency of using our current funds and increase efficiency in most government run sectors
Right now we have an inflated police force and jobs that should need one person,done by five
Just look at most university staff
Employees everywhere yet no one is doing their job or wants to work, might as well not have them
Increase the digitization of our bureaucracy,make it so you can due most things online
As  person who has lived in a high tax society I'm telling you, not only is it inefficient, it's frustrating and leaves you always wanting more
>I assume the government uses Bulgaria as a positive example
What a time to be alive
Yeah, places like the Cotswolds are really beautiful, more so than London even
If online games with loot boxes have taught me anything about life it's that the market will never self regulate itself
The supplier will try more and more questionable ways to squeeze money out of the buyer and the buyer will still buy like a sheep
Weird that we even have any
If I remember correctly it's forbidden to shoot porn in Bulgaria
I think porn itself is banned
It's just that no one tries to enforce the law
I wish that was the only problem
In a lot of cases both women and men are pressured to do things they initially didn't agree on
For example women are coerced into shooting much more aggressive fims, than they are willing to
Men are told they have to do one gay porn film so they go on to women, but then they only do gay porn
In addition human trafficking is also a huge problem in those countries, and many of those "porn stars" are actually victims of trafficking which were promised jobs as waitresses and what not, but had their documents taken away and now they can't leave
The EU won't want any exemptions probably, Scotland would need to join Schengen and accept the euro
Catalonia can't join
All members need to agree to someone joining, and you can see that Spain won't be best pals with Catalonia and they would most likely say no
That's why Macedonia changed its name again, so they can pleasure Greece and they wouldn't stop them from joining the EU
Macedonia also signed a friendship treaty with Bulgaria so Bulgaria helped them with Greece
They had to rewrite their history according to how Bulgaria views it
Catalonia would flat out be refused by Spain
BUT THE ECONOMY
"Due to unforeseen difficulties, the Genghis Khan exhibit will be replaced with Winnie the Pooh exhibit
Yeah, it really bugs me when people cite the Wikipedia figures for people killed by the Mongols as if they are gospel truth
Historians are still trying to calculate the number of people killed in much later conflicts like WWII and despite the extensive records kept by the belligerents the figures usually vary quite a bit
Going further back in the past naturally the variations become ever bigger
Historians can't even agree how many people lived in Constantinople or Baghdad or Cordoba at a certain point, let alone give precise estimates of the fatalities in any given conflict before the modern era
I mean, there is no doubt the Mongols were extremely brutal conquerors but there is no need to exaggerate and turn them into basically demons in human form who wanted nothing but to kill everyone they met

Thanks
I visited Bucharest last September for work
I had never visited before but I could tell a lot was going on and I can say that you are miles ahead of us, Bulgarians
It's not perfect but you have the direction right and I can only hope we will be able to catch up
Crying in Bulgarian
I'm a CompSci student in the UK and there are so many Romanians in the department that people joke that most students will end up learning Romanian from exposure in the 4 years of study
Same
Can you please do a large post with this data for all the EE ex-communist countries, so we can compare
It's not just that
Some of us choose to stay in shitty countries just so we can stay close to our families
Not everyone has that choice
I wouldn't say that my choice of Uni was due to the local ones being corrupt
IMO the difference between a good and a great Uni isn't the quality of education but the people you network with
I'm almost sure I'd learn basically the same stuff at a local Uni as I do in the UK but I wouldn't meet people as driven or as diverse
Also I think that living abroad for a few years is an experience that everyone who has the opportunity should try out
Laughs in Bulgarian
Yes, but people have also traveled or lived in another country for a few months
Example: I want to return to Barcelona
I want to move to Barcelona
I want to LIVE in Barcelona but I don't have that choice at the moment
Idk, I think that networking helps a lot
Every IT company I've interned at has had these "recommendation" systems where every full-time employee can recommend their friends
The friend gets to skip the first trivial interview stages that are basically time-wasters and the employee gets a bonus out of it
From what I know the more connections you have in the industry the more opportunities you have to job-hop and each hop equates to a pay rise
Since I started before the entire Brexit fiasco I'm eligible for a student loan from the UK government
Then a "poor student" bursary from my Uni covers my accommodation costs and the rest I pay off with money from summer internships
I've done one each summer since I graduated from high school, so I've basically not had to rely on my parents for financing anything
Why Germany
> Saw this on r/dankmemes and thought I'd pollute *other* subs with it
Fun fact, two reasons Iceland speed limit is so low
1) Snowstorms
2) Sheep often end up on the highway and if you hit a sheep, you have to pay for it, and the farmer gets to set the price
140 is indeed the maximum speed allowed in Bulgaria, but only on newly built sections of motorways and not all of them
So all in all about 100 km of roads in the whole country
My country never fails to amaze me
I thought 140 was the norm
Жули до дупка, вуте-е-е!
We have the best roads and the best cars in Europe
This is incorrect
All highways (~800km) have a speed limit of 140 with exceptions on some turns and tunnels, as well as a 60km stretch on one of the highways, which is in bad condition even for Bulgarian standards (so the solution was not to repair it but set the limit to 90km/h)
Technically you have to be at least 10 over for it to be punishable so 149 is fine and really they only start caring at 20 over because the fine for 10-19 over is only €25 so 159 is more like the real speed limit
It's mostly true for Bulgaria as well
Biggest problem is the condition of the roads imo, but of course we have a fair amount of idiots driving the wrong way on a highway because the missed the exit so it can't be just "infrastructure bad".
Not with these roads
At the service stations they have cctv set up so that you can look at from different parts of the highway ahead, so you can judge if it's safe to set off with the snow etc
They do
Only one and it is the ring road around the coast
"Intelligent Speed Assistance" is going to be mandatory on new cars in a few years
I wonder how many people will die as a result of older cars overtaking new cars driving the strict speed limit everywhere
We can't have memes in /r/europe but facebook boomer cartoons are ok
There are 2 groups
People angry about Brexit and people who think there are cultural differences between the nations in the UK
The Texas independence movement is literally a meme, meanwhile Scottish independence has pretty significant support
Americans don’t take these things seriously because they’re not serious
There has always been fringe weirdos talking about seceding from the country, but there hasn’t been any actual momentum, because they’re not real
However, Scottish independence has serious momentum, and is a serious consideration for them
Yes it does
Hypocrisy has nothing to do with this because they aren’t the same situation
In Bulgaria, "бира/bira" is used most of the times, but I've seen "пиво/pivo" used to describe an old-fashioned beer
GARAGARDOA
Tldr
: Beer
Cwrwadgsjkfhdhf
You're right
"Пиво/pivo" feels a bit more official if that makes sense
We use "пиво/pivo" as well, don't worry
They are interchangeable, but "pivo" feels more sophisticated and slightly old-fashioned
Its usage is more common in words describing beer manufacturing
For example, "пивоварна/pivovarna" means brewery
If she was young, it's entirely possible she didn't realize "пиво" is used for beer and not just any kind of drink
Younger people don't really care for old-timey words around here
Given that "pivo" is a part of the official names of a number of local beer brands (Shumensko, Pirinsko, Burgasko, etc), I agree with the other comments that you somehow found a singularly
ignorant waitress

Point to me a conflict like that in the last 20-30 even 40 years where the United states invaded it's neighbour because they were going to sign an economic treaty with a different union
Where did they annex a territory, where did they down a civilian aircraft, where did they attack passing trade ships, where did they deny doing it

Hopefully you Czechs and Slovaks don't have ill feelings lingering towards us
Bulgaria has a bit of an issue with the idolisation of historic figures
Having various czars plastered on first grade classroom walls combined with recitals of patriotic poetry are like a form of indoctrination and the history lessons are practically propaganda
Yes, it's creepy as fuck, I'm glad I'm not the only one scared by it
There's some really conservative people on that subreddit but it's definitely better
The new generation is a bit more disillusioned/perceptive
It's generally people who know foreign languages and who are more connected to the outer world that have a better chance of realising this stuff
I was really lucky to have good foreign teachers and history teachers who were adamant on approaching history critically
It was a watershed moment when a German teacher told us he's not patriotic in like the 8th grade
Like we are allowed to

It's already clear, NATO is a defensive alliance
And we stand with Greece and Armenia
Didn't only some NATO members bomb Serbia
Which would make it a voluntary offensive initiative not something NATO can force on its members and so similarly Turkey can't force NATO to assist its attack
They should if they want but why haven't they done it already if they so desperately wanted
Yes what about it
Because we want to help duh
I mean countries are legally required to help Turkey if it gets attacked
But not if it's the one attacking
I'm not finding what you're saying so give a link please
According to Wikipedia "Merciful Angel" wasn't even the official name but a Serbian mistranslation
I can't find sources on who did what exactly but apparently Serbia tried to sue 10 NATO members and it had 16 at the time so I'm assuming the rest weren't involved much
We'll see about that
Because it's not its primary objective
It's not like NATO forbids offence
Members are free to do that, other NATO members just aren't obligated to follow them
But they are obliged to do something in case a NATO member is attacked
That's how it's defensive
That has nothing to do with NATO members being forced to participate though
And another note although people were killed by NATO, it's participation still pales in comparison to the actual Yugoslav wars which killed 130k people
NATO killed one thousand
Well it's NATO, the most powerful military alliance to have ever existed
Naturally there would be few attacks on it meanwhile its members have lots of opportunities to attack
NATO's track record hasn't been stellar but frankly considering it represent a huge chunk of global military and economic might it could have been much worse
I could see this power being far more abused  if it were in the hands of many others
Look at for example what Turkey is doing despite being  a midget compared to NATO
Or can you imagine Russia with 25 times bigger GDP
If NATO were really offensive most of the world would be under it probably
> Countries were forced to participate, including Greece
Well  that's why I asked you a source
At the very least it seems others weren't forced
>How is war in Yugoslavia connected to Kosovo conflict
One happened in 91-95 and other one started in 98
It's considered one of the Yugoslav wars and besides if death and destruction is what you care about then it's only natural we don't only focus on NATO's part in those conflicts
>Nato has no legal morals,
Yeah
There's very little morality on the world stage and a military alliance is definitely not the first place it should be expected in
The argument is more like that NATO hasn't had more defensive moments because no one is dumb enough to be attacking it
The rest is  to show what a truly offensive NATO would look like
>Look, I don't think NATO is some bloodthirsty behemoth without any impulse control, and there is obviously a defensive component to the whole thing, but that's not all there is
Yes, alright, so it's primarily defensive
I think, especially in the context of a Turkey-Armenia conflict, that's what matters
> I don't know what that means
I'm saying that if NATO were truly aggressive we would be seeing that everywhere because NATO just has  opportunities and temptations to be aggressive that no one else has
>I wouldn't call it primarily defensive
Fifty-fifty at best, if assigning such a figure makes sense
I'd rank it better but  I think we're kinda talking about different things
I think  we should make a distinction between what NATO members do and what NATO does
Aggression from NATO members is more like an extra-curricular activity that some countries do on their own time
You have the most aggressive members in the US, UK, France and then you have more peaceful ones like Germany or the ones in the North and East
But the most peaceful ones aren't obligated to participate even if they sometimes do
In the end what really links NATO countries is that they have to support each other in the event someone is attacked, although like you said there's   leeway there if you don't want to follow the spirit of the treaty
Nothing says communism better then using tanks against your own people
great stuff
Greetings from Bulgaria
(our metro also expanding by EU funds)
4 New stations opened last month on Sofia
Thanks EU
EU has a lot of problems, but to leave it because of that is like cutting your foot to prevent stubbing your toe on a table
For a corrupt country like mine, EU is the only chance to have someone slap our politicians' wrist when they become too greedy
True
As a Bulgarian layman I always considered Germany and Switzerland Western Europe, Croatia Southern Europe, Poland Eastern Europe and the Baltics Northern Europe
Everything else is Uneurope
I can't speak for the other SE European nations but I've always seen Bulgaria as a less Eastern European and much more Southeastern, we share a lot of similarities with souther Europeans, most not good qualities but still
I don't like this map

How do people working in offices deal with the sweat from the bike ride
I would love to go to work with a bike even tho I'll probably get killed on our streets but the sweat is a no-no for me

In Netherlands, the bike is part of the formal attire
Obviously
Dutch people don't sweat, got it
That's what I expect to hear really, that basically everyone is wet and or sweaty but nobody cares
I was trying to find a justification of me going to work sweaty and with messed up cloths but I just cant, we are not there yet, not even close

Investments in public transportation, infrastructure, social services, education and science are up or at least have remained constant
France has an unemployment rate standing at about 9%. So yeah some people got a pay boost and because no actual reform can take place to make France more competitive, it was those 9% who made the sacrifice
They are the truly poor and they got fucked by low income earners wanting more for themselves
Instead of a creation of jobs thru reforms and lower corporate tax, they made sure that French labor is the least competitive in the EU
Germany had a similar problem and the Hartz plan generally helped bring unemployment down
Economist agree that the reforms in Germany made sense and were needed, the effects are obvious in that Germany now has very low unemployment rate while before it was as big as France has currently
Look at 2002 just before the reforms, 10% just like France
A TON of laws have passed SPECIFICALLY for poorer people ! Like higher (+100€) minimum pensions for the retired ? Like the transfer of social contributions from the retired (except the poorest retired) to the workers ? Like the removal of the local housing tax except for richer people ?The ONLY law that was passed specifically for rich people was the removal of the "Impôt sur la Fortune", which was scientifically a terrible, terrible tax which did not succeed at transferring money from the rich to the poor
On the contrary, the increase of the CSG hits the wealthy because it taxes CAPITAL gains, which is something I'm sure you're very happy about, right ? What about thr "poverty plan" ? It's seen by the social sector as one of the best social plans ever written by a government, because it really tackles the root issues of poverty in France .
France needs a progressive corporate tax system like the UK
Right now the 33
33% tax is not only higher than the maximum tax in the UK(30%), it doesn't help smaller businesses
For below 300k profits the tax rate is 19% for the UK
Even not putting a progressive system making the tax 28
8% is a good move
You need it to make it easier to start a business in France
Easy to understand tax code, easy to understand laws and websites by the government that are user friendly and explain all the necessary bureaucracy in a straight manner
Like the UK does
Why did I have to use to 3-rd party websites to get the information about tax in France
I think Macron was right wanting to remove some labor laws and try and boost the economy
The Netherlands, UK and Germany have lower benefits, had labour reforms but at the same time below 5% unemployment, so is it a coincidence that these reforms correlated with a decrease in unemployment rates
Reforms to the vocational-training system will help remove the barriers for hiring people
I know there was a law where a company could not slash jobs in France if the company was doing ok globally
This is a silly law and just removes any incentive to setup an HQ or factory in France
It removes their ability to do dynamic changes to be competitive
Reform of employment tribunals
If you can't fire employees that are bad, or make it very hard, overall a business will be slow in hiring new workers,especially youth workers
Macron’s overhaul of the labor code has helped ease those concerns, and hiring on permanent contracts rose 6
4 percent in the fourth quarter to 48 percent, a level not seen since before the global financial crisis
Improve training for the unemployed
This is obvious, a lack of skilled workers is creating production bottlenecks and snarling up supply chains
Macron’s government also plans to invest 15 billion euros in job training over the next five years
Increase spending on Research and Development as well as education
France needs competitive universities
The Yellow vest supposed(as said by the BBC) demand to decrease entry requirements is backwards
The better the schools the more talent will come
Help tech startups with some no tax incentive, they will hire young people from University and if they succeed they will bring more in tax over time than the initial bonus
>Pupils’ chances of escaping their socio-economic background are smaller in France than in any of the other 71 countries surveyed
His reforms are seen as positive both by teachers,universities and business
But yet French residents are against them, why, why fear change
What if it's a bit harder to get in to university if your education is overall better
>Government proposes 2% increase to research ministry’s cash allocation for 2019
It seems his doing the right thing here
>Despite spending as much on secondary schooling as other OECD countries, France no longer achieves corresponding results
Between 2003 and 2012, performance in international maths tests fell compared with other countries
The real shock was an international study of reading known as PIRLS, published in 2017, in which French pupils lagged in 34th position, behind those in Spain, Portugal and Italy
Their level had dropped by 14 points since 2001
The bac is an entrance ticket to university, yet too many students drop out once they get there
Fully 70% of undergraduates, says the ministry, fail to complete their degree in three years
>On February 14th Jean-Michel Blanquer, the education minister and a former director of ESSEC, a top French business school, is due to unveil his reform plans for the bac
>The new French bac, which will be awarded for the first time in 2021, will look more like the school-leaving exam in other European countries, where continuous assessment represents a big chunk of the final grade, and subject specialism, such as for British A-levels, is common
In France, though, the shake-up may well create an uproar
Many in the teaching profession fear that continuous assessment will kill the prized national standard, and in effect bring in a two-tier bac, with more prestigious grades being awarded by top teachers in top schools, rather than by national markers
Teachers of subjects that may become optional are worried about their future
Unions are threatening strikes
>The government hopes to overhaul an ailing university system, which international students have previously voted the worst in Europe
France has pledged to invest almost a billion euros into higher education over the next five years
>Macron has proposed to tighten the selection process for those entering French universities, while at present all French high school graduates are guaranteed a public university place regardless of their grades
>“The reform introduced the fact that the criteria used to select students is going to be based on the marks of their last years of high school, on their motivation and teacher’s opinions, and not at all on the baccalaureat,”
>Students across France have been staging protests against President Emmanuel Macron’s proposed education reforms, which would introduce tougher entry requirements for the country’s universities
It seems that it's not a matter of free university or giving you a social net that helps escape poverty
You need a good and fair education system first
But paradoxically at the same students are against any reforms that will make entry harder even if that means a reformed bac test, which would make it easier
So any reform be it education,labor or tax is met with unions,students or residents stopping it
Yet the same people then what reforms that make France greener,competitive,want higher wages, less tax but more social spending
It seems that a stalemate of the French social contract has formed, where reforms are wanted but not accepted
It seems that Macron's liberalization reforms actually did help the unemployment rate
Going bellow 2008 levels after he became president and started his reforms, as well as plans to slash corporate tax rate
France tried that and it failed miserably, currently it has a higher than both Germany and the UK corporate tax, and higher taxes on the rich, at one point going up to 70% of income
The bleeding dry argument has no merit if you actually bother to check the statistics
Investments in public transportation are up, investments in education are up, the science budget is up,investments in infrastructure are up
Nobody is bleeding them dry, this is just protestor propaganda at this point or a gross misconception that has naturally propagated across social media
France has an unemployment rate standing at about 9%. So yeah some people got a pay boost and because no actual reform can take place to make France more competitive, it was those 9% who made the sacrifice so that the current employed enjoy higher benefits
They are the truly poor and they got fucked by low income earners wanting more for themselves
Instead of a creation of jobs thru reforms and lower corporate tax, they made sure that French labor is the least competitive in the EU

Help tech startups with some no tax incentive, they will hire young people from University and if they succeed they will bring more in tax over time than the initial bonus
>Pupils’ chances of escaping their socio-economic background are smaller in France than in any of the other 71 countries surveyed
His reforms are seen as positive both by teachers,universities and business
But yet French residents are against them, why, why fear change
What if it's a bit harder to get in to university if your education is overall better
>Government proposes 2% increase to research ministry’s cash allocation for 2019
It seems his doing the right thing here
>Despite spending as much on secondary schooling as other OECD countries, France no longer achieves corresponding results
Between 2003 and 2012, performance in international maths tests fell compared with other countries
The real shock was an international study of reading known as PIRLS, published in 2017, in which French pupils lagged in 34th position, behind those in Spain, Portugal and Italy
Their level had dropped by 14 points since 2001
The bac is an entrance ticket to university, yet too many students drop out once they get there
Fully 70% of undergraduates, says the ministry, fail to complete their degree in three years
>On February 14th Jean-Michel Blanquer, the education minister and a former director of ESSEC, a top French business school, is due to unveil his reform plans for the bac
>The new French bac, which will be awarded for the first time in 2021, will look more like the school-leaving exam in other European countries, where continuous assessment represents a big chunk of the final grade, and subject specialism, such as for British A-levels, is common
In France, though, the shake-up may well create an uproar
Many in the teaching profession fear that continuous assessment will kill the prized national standard, and in effect bring in a two-tier bac, with more prestigious grades being awarded by top teachers in top schools, rather than by national markers
Teachers of subjects that may become optional are worried about their future
Unions are threatening strikes
>The government hopes to overhaul an ailing university system, which international students have previously voted the worst in Europe
France has pledged to invest almost a billion euros into higher education over the next five years
>Macron has proposed to tighten the selection process for those entering French universities, while at present all French high school graduates are guaranteed a public university place regardless of their grades
>“The reform introduced the fact that the criteria used to select students is going to be based on the marks of their last years of high school, on their motivation and teacher’s opinions, and not at all on the baccalaureat,”
>Students across France have been staging protests against President Emmanuel Macron’s proposed education reforms, which would introduce tougher entry requirements for the country’s universities
It seems that it's not a matter of free university or giving you a social net that helps escape poverty
You need a good and fair education system first
But paradoxically at the same students are against any reforms that will make entry harder even if that means a reformed bac test, which would make it easier
So any reform be it education,labor or tax is met with unions,students or residents stopping it
Yet the same people then what reforms that make France greener,competitive,want higher wages, less tax but more social spending
It seems that a stalemate of the French social contract has formed, where reforms are wanted but not accepted
> You can see this blindness clearly in your argument against lower cost university
Higher entry requirments doesn't mean higher cost for students
As far as I understand the reforms the government will still pay you to go to school
No one is talking, or at least I'm not talking and neither is Macron for the implementation of fees but for a reform in the bac, as well as fixing a standing issue of low social mobility thru education
>Pupils’ chances of escaping their socio-economic background are smaller in France than in any of the other 71 countries surveyed
This needs to be fixed but lowering your standing on the world list as well as your research output is not the way to go about it
It's simply the worst possible fix
Reforming the bac will do much more than simply lowering the grades for entry
Attack the problem not a symptom
>At no point did I hear anyone in France talk about competitivity of universities, except those who want to increase their cost to entry of course
You can also see this in your conclusion
But see just because you think my opinion is that of another person doesn't make it so
The reforms I linked are regarding entry requirements and modernizing the University system
“The reform introduced the fact that the criteria used to select students is going to be based on the marks of their last years of high school, on their motivation and teacher’s opinions, and not at all on the baccalaureat,”
They also propose to change the format of the bac to be more aligned with the rest of Europe
You can't tell me with a straight face that me talking about falling mathematics scores and entry requirements is the same as someone talking about increasing or more accurately implementing fees
This is the definition of a straw man and you just did it
>What I heard was : people want more public services, and don't want poor people to pay for it, because it's unfair
You skipped everything I said and how the poor aren't actually taxed more
Or do you mean the 6c eco tax that was well less for the average person than the decrease in house tax
The rest of your argument is based on emotional reasoning that really no reply can argue with since it isn't rational
You paint a picture of a stance I don't really hold
Pretty much 90% of your argument is strawmaning what I've said and what it actually meant instead of taking it at face value
I meant what I said and nothing more, nothing less
> let's take the money where it is
Was the ISF an absurd tax ? Maybe, but at least it was that : a tax on capital
But capital gains tax did increase
Taxes on poor people were removed and those on rich people remain
You are repeating your blind rhetoric without actually reading my original reply
>You're just justifying German or British policies, failing to remember that we're talking about France, a country with an egalitarian culture contrary to the other two
Economic policy of the kind I'm talking about has nothing to do with culture,egalitarianism or family values
This is yet another emotional argument that really doesn't mean anything
>And I think you're wrong
Yes, you have copied every single argument that we've been hearing in every big media since the '07/'08 crisis, and we've been applying it, result ? It failed
You mean when the socialist government was in power and then proceeded to tax rich people up to 75% of their money and gave out free shit to everyone and nothing improved in the slightest, instead both the education system and health system started to worsen in quality
This is the same reforms that are proposed today, really
Why are they proposing a new law that is the same as the old one, unless
you are full of shit and haven't even read the proposed reforms
Is this a joke or something
I didn't copy my arguments it's simply want is needed and it definitely has not been implemented since 2007 as you assert
>We've added the word equality everywhere for a reason, we aren't a liberal country and never will be
I fail to see how individual freedoms are against an equal society but ok
This is another one of those emotional arguments on how things are just too different and unique and nobody understands the perils of the poor French people
It's a stupid argument because it doesn't address any of my points but simply taunts a difference in culture to every proposed solution or reform, to the point where you said nothing of substance since you don't actually speak for the entire country nor do yo actually represent everyone's feelings
We can talk about subjects with studies and proposed solutions, the pros and cons of those solutions but if we just start blabing on about the emotional baggage of stuff the conversation comes to an end since we're not arguing about points now but emotional appeal
That is, you appeal to this rebellion ideal that doesn't actually manifest in these protests
I wonder if this is some kind of fallacy, appeal to ideal or something
>Did you actually heard workers saying they wanted to lower their paycheck ? Or who wanted to work more for less ? Or who wanted the hygiene protection service to go away ? Or who wanted each company to be able to abolish the law if they don't want to respect it ? Because I didn't.
>But protests have also erupted over other issues, including calls for higher wages, lower taxes, better pensions and easier university entry requirements
Also politico has a list of the 42 demands, that I think was first shared by the economist reporter on twitter
You can't just protest without having some kind of demands
The fuel tax, something we can argue all day that is beneficial for France and the WORLD, of 6c has been removed now
Obviously there's more demands,right
Well you can't say you didn't hear protestors wanting stuff but still protesting, that's absurd
>What I heard was : people want more public services, and don't want poor people to pay for it, because it's unfair
This simple sentence is what justify the "reforms are wanted" illusion, but that's not the truth : nobody asked for them
What people want is less poverty, higher wages, how ? Well, while we're loosing money, finance has never been as healthy as it is today so there we go : let's take the money where it is
Was the ISF an absurd tax ? Maybe, but at least it was that : a tax on capital
Taking it away was the one gift too many
This is absurd
You can't want less unemployment, more investments etc without the proposed reforms, unless you just want France to borrow money until it's credit rating gets destroyed and it defaults leaving everybody in the country worse off
France already employs more than almost any other EU nation via government spending, this is not the way forward
Creating a stable economy with a good middle class via investments and attracting business is way more sustainable than just employing a bunch of people doing inefficient work on minimum wage
What does the finance is a sector that's doing good have to do with tax, they already pay the 33
33% income tax and every worker,banker,investor pays income and capital gains tax on their individual earnings as well
Do you think it makes any economic sense to go and take the bank's money and pay for shit with it
Do you understand how banks work, where their money comes from
It comes from the people, you are literally saying you want to rob the people so that you can give it back to them
What part of the finance sector, that  offers tens of thousands of high paying jobs, do you want to destroy exactly
Be more specific than pointing at finance and demanding some mythical tax
A tax on what exactly, which part of the sector, how will that influence the development of that sector, will it destroy more jobs than it will bring via government spending
You have not actually answered any of these questions, the proposal lack depth or actual though a part from a shallow pointing of the finger, it will not lead to reforms, it will not lead to prosperity
To be honest I fail to see it do anything but diminish the sectors growth and weaken Paris for when Brexit happens and the London financial sector starts seeking a new home
Like Frankfurt or Amsterdam
I guess I'll have to repeat myself
Higher (+100€) minimum pensions for the retired , the transfer of social contributions from the retired (except the poorest retired) to the workers , the removal of the local housing tax except for richer people were pro lower class laws passed by this government without the protests, another wage hike has been given plus the removal of fuel tax
The ONLY law that was passed specifically for rich people was the removal of the "Impôt sur la Fortune", which was scientifically a terrible, terrible tax which did not succeed at transferring money from the rich to the poor
On the contrary, the increase of the CSG hits the wealthy because it taxes CAPITAL gains, which is something I'm sure you're very happy about, right ? What about the "poverty plan" ? It's seen by the social sector as one of the best social plans ever written by a government, because it really tackles the root issues of poverty in France . Why are you ignoring that
You say you want more public services but Macron's government HAS INCREASED PUBLIC SPENDING
Government proposes 2% increase to research ministry’s cash allocation for 2019
FOR THE SECOND YEAR IN A ROW AN INCREASE MORE THAN THAT OF INFLATION
Macron’s government also plans to invest 15 billion euros in job training over the next five years
France has pledged to invest almost a billion euros into higher education over the next five years
On top of the normal budget
> now students have to be selected
Students always had to be selected for tertiary education
The new plan makes it so that your entire high school performance is looked at, and the final exam is now more like A levels vs a general knowledge test
Where you come from is not a criteria
It's kinda laughable we're disusing this when in it;s widely known fact that the previous method was in favour of the rich
In order to get to nice ecoles you had to know someone or be from a rich family
Now you have a better shot
Can you source your claim
Like give me a link to the specific document
I know some french but my GF will translate it for me
>APL decrease
Tax increase for the lower middle class
Only tax that was implemented was the fuel tax, no other changes to the tax code have been done a part from what we already discussed
Can you link me a source on the increased taxes for lower and middle class brackets
It seems the taxes are the same as they were 2 years ago
Thus we've not seen an increase
>No, because economics are a hard science about rational actors
Seriously, we're talking about politics, obviously it has to do with what the people want, how they see their life and what their values are
The same idea might be good in the eyes of the Brits and bad in the eyes of the French
There is no objectively good answer in politics, because if there was, we'll just have a cast of scientists leading the world with their cold and objective science and not little group of democracies disagreeing on fundamental principles like how the economy should work and what objective is the most important in a given situation
But we're talking economics here, what can the government do with it's tools to influence the market and society to prosperity
The actions needed for a society to prosper are not always populsit, in fact they rarely are
Populism often mistaken for the will of the people is proposing simple ad hoc solution to complex problems that do not in fact take the bigger picture in to accord or even base their finding in studies
Like a populist opinnion would be rent controls for instance, but empirical evidence has shown that it doesn't work and economic theory supports that finding
Should we still implement those rent controls even though the science says no
I don't think so
In this case the people do not want a tax on them because, well, nobody likes paying more for gas
But studies have shown that it does effect what type of car people choose
Coupled with the tax right off for electric cars, the carbon tax, something proposed both by climate scientist  and macro economist, is a step in to the right direction
It's easily seen in both the US and EU market that when fuel prices go up, people buy more fuel efficient cars
>This paper evaluates the effect of fuel prices on new vehicle fuel economy in the eight largest Europe an markets . The analysis spans the years 2002 – 200 7 and uses detailed vehicle registration and specification data to control for policies, consumer preferences, and other potentially confounding factors
Fuel prices have a statistically significant effect on new vehicle fuel economy in Europe , but t his estimated effect is much smaller than that for the United States .** Within Europe, fuel economy respond s more in the United Kingdom and France than in the other large markets**
>Who had Macron as minister of the economy and was heavily criticized by the left wing because they did nothing for the people and by the right wing because their policies were absolutely stupid ? Also the same government that gave companies 40 billions euros as a gift because "they'll create a million jobs if we do" which did absolutely nothing ?
Mind sourcing that
I tried searching for a tax right off or even direct subsidies but could not find anything really
He seems to have done an ok but not exceptional job, what would you say was bad about his rulings
The OECD estimated that the Macron Law would generate a "0
3% increase in GDP over five-years and a 0
4% increase over 10-years"[73] Ludovic Subran, the chief economist at credit insurance company, Euler Hermes, estimated that Macron Law would give France a GDP increase of 0
it says his main criticism was he failure to stop a factory from closing
He also increased the government share in Renault
He was minister only for less than 2 years
I don't see anything on him approving a 40 billion law
>Liberal in the economics sense
You're applying liberal ideas : we should loosen workers right, lower taxes on companies, etc
These ideas don't work in France, they never did, they never will
These ideas work everywhere
I'm not talking about destroying the entire thing and neither is Macron
A progressive tax system for companies is good news, and some workers rights are absurd or badly made
You can still have a high standard but not be absurd
I already talked on what I think is absurd in the first post
These are liberal ideas in the sense that they will free up the markets so that efficiency can be made
The same thing happened in Germany can you tell me, without saying the French values are different because they really aren't, what makes the French market not flexible to such changes
I want an economic reason
If you think the French political spectrum is left, well why didn't you vote for the communist party or socialist or whatever
In fact it seems a lot of people in France like to vote to the right side of spectrum
I don't see anthropological arguments as a basis to make current governance
An essay is not proof
In fact such a conjecture has the nice touch of being unprovable really
Such are the social sciences
Emmanuel Todd speculates that so and so is true but he presents no real proof but offering more assertions
If I understand you correctly you seem to think, that what France wants, because of some dudes unscientific cherry-picked analysis of older generations, a communist governance
In that case may I recommend you read The Road to Serfdom by Hayek
He uses good arguments on why any revolution of the people follows a strong leader race where only the worst can win, making all forms of communism or more precise all governments saying communism soon^tm to be a dead end
I can go on to how communism is not an effective distributor of goods in a society and so on but we're not arguing that right now
>pro-rich reforms have already gone throug
What pro rich reforms
The increase in capital gains
The French government decided to abolish ISF and replace it with the tax on real estate (IFI)
Professional property was always exempt from this tax which kinda says a lot of it's capabilities of being an anti rich people tax
Taxing investments is simply not a good move, I understand taxing capital gains, as that is a form of income but taxing investments, and I don't mean assets, is simply a way to stop having ANY foreign investment in the country and to make already rich locals remove the money from the economy by investing it in ANY other EU market
Surely you can't think that's good for the average person
The tax
Several countries have abolished their versions of the tax in recent years, including Austria, Denmark, Germany, The Netherlands, Finland, Sweden and Spain, and Greece
In Sweden, among other places, the elimination has had no effect on inequality, and there are signs it has actually spurred growth
The tax accounts for less than 1
5 % of revenue and it's main source of taxation remains in the new law, so no real change will be seen
Macron is going to increase as from the tax year 2018 the level of social contributions on pension income, investment income and capital gains
He proposes to increase the rate of the so-called Contribution Sociale Généralisée by 1
7 percentage points
The average ISF payer, paid less than 2k of tax, really the tax was symbolic at best
>Which, before the yellow jackets revolt, was going to also hit a lot of not so wealthy retired people, who when they worked were told that "we're taking your money and giving it to your parents", and now our told "we're taking your money and giving it to your children"...
Source, the planned change in pensions was planned before the revolt according to the BBC
>My entire family works in social institutions, I can tell you, not a single one of them told me it was "the best social plan", and even if it was, it's overshadowed by the rest
Not according to most people
They are also planning a negative tax income or UBI
Something all socialist have been campaigning for years
Under his new tax plan more people will be included in free healthcare and more money will be given to hospitals
An overblown story might not be the best basis on your opinion on the budget, the fact is the budget for HC has increased more than inflation
He's pledged money for schools already way before the protests, it's not possible to do this overnight you know
He has offered training to help the specialization gap before the protests, and lowest research money from WE goes to the UK
The budget according to french scientist is getting better in a acceptable manner when it comes to research
Also done before the protest
It is unnecessarily huge

Oh wait points are now macedonian also
I doubt that Bulgaria & Romania are in the same category
When I was i Bucharest literally everybody was speaking good enough english there
Even some low paid workers, while in Bulgaria is a common thing even a high paying workers to speak garbage english (source: I've been to a few conferences where I literally cannot understand what they're talking, since their accent is the worst, no idea why they're even trying)
This sad
Me not happy

Ok, question for the political majors:
What can the EU do in this instance
From what little I know about politics, violating a nation's sovereignty is tantamount to declaring war, so direct intervention is out
They're not in the EU, so no legal channels on that end either
Economic sanctions (though that seems it'll hurt the population more than the rulers)

We take it pretty seriously and I think we reacted quite quickly compared to the other European countries

That's so sad
This is NOT the way

>...pizzas, I recommend seafood
Ew, get out of here, this should be banned ASAP along with the pineapples
Seriously though, that was a good response
Kinda makes you happy to think it's not that easy for everyone out there to get ahold of a whole country's laws and rules (unless of course you're someone as Erdogan and Putin and you've worked hard for that)
(Edit: To stir things up, I actually love and eat only two types of pizza, Margarita and Marinara
I cannot remember a single time when I've eaten meat on pizza, let alone sea creature on pizza
So for all of you giving wonderful ideas about pizzas, you're replying to *that* type of person
(Jokes aside, I got that thing about Iceland and seafood)
Yep, read some Askreddit right after the election and got the impression the guy have prepared for over 10 years to run for President
But he's yet to seize control the way Putin and Erdogan did
Oh no, actually no
At least Eastern Europe is full of ridiculous politicians, and Erdogan is almost there too
Welp, there's a difference between east and west regarding Europe, and now that I think of, the west isn't immune to ridiculous politicians too (Le Pen, Boris Johnson

I have been living in Scotland for nearly 6 years
Graduated from Dundee Uni two years ago and I must say the education in Scotland is absolutely amazing
Not only  is it free but it has some of the best universities not only in Europe but the world (Edi Uni, Glasgow Uni, St
Andrews)
I would highly recommend studying and living here
I couldn't agree more
I loved every bit of my 4 years there as well
I do not have any information about that, but if you get accepted in a Scottish uni before brexit hits they will definitely pay for your education
The free tuition applies only for graduate schemes and a very limited amount of master degrees
Most masters degrees are paid and actually quite expensive
I would recommend taking a look at this website: [ You can probably find a free masters or a fully funded one
I would also recommend going straight for a PHD because in the UK you can skip masters and jump from undergrad to phd student if you are interested in that
I am not sure how it works if your undergrad is not from the UK but I would be surprised if there is a problem
If you are interested in a PHD you can take a look here: [
Also Edi Uni is an amazing choice I am actually in the process of applying for a Phd in Data science there
&#x200B;
Well I have been working since day one to support myself and also I am currently working as a developer, so I have paid my due and will continue to invest in the country
So take your typical English welcome and piss off
What's more I used to rent a flat in Hilltown haha
Thank you and good luck
Well the education is: 4yx 9k =36k(which is not true cuz when i started it was still 6
3k but let me indulge you)
I have currently returned 4yx2k+2yx6k= 20k in taxes so I am pretty close
Also the free education only applies for EU nationals like myself which anyways stay here and return the investment everybody else has to pay
Whats more the government makes so much money from all the asian students that pay 2-3 times more than natives so don't kid yourself that it is the English taxpayer that pays for the free education
Also I find it very weird that you dont moan about the millions of junkies and 18 year old girls that get pregnant in order to get benefits but you complain about smart and ambitious people coming and making this country better
Let me guess you voted for England(Scotland did not vote yes) to leave the UK
I admit I always get very defensive because I am kinda tired of being accused of being a leech when I actually care a lot about the UK and try my best to be productive and give back so when I saw your comment I presumed you meant it in a bad way
However I have never gotten a tax exception of any kind so I am not sure about what other services you mean
Yeah I got you basically since education is not part of the taxes you pay you cant really repay for your education
Also its fair to say that a large amount of that was paid by the English because they are so many compared to Scotland, Wales and NI but not all
Literally the same as Mark
Rutten from the Netherlands
We're basically fucked but what else is new
This is a very weak swear word
It's literally "to hell with it". We have plenty of others with more oomph in them
In Bulgarian "Po dyavolite" is exactly heck
The "fuck" equivalent in here is "ebal sum ti majkata", which literally translates to: "I will fuck your mom". We also have like 10-15 ways to phrase that and I don't think anything else comes close in popularity
The Bulgarian one is very very wrong
And why is it in Latin characters
Some of these seem way too innocent to be credible
This reminds me of *The Good Place* and how they said Fork because they couldn't say Fuck
This is likely the Fork version of the map
Can we have the Fuck version now please
The bulgarian one is kinda mild, it's like 'damn'. Deba or ebati would be more like it
In Bulgaria we mosly say
Еби му майката Or боклук грозен Or в на майка ти устата Or пичка ти лелина Or маамкаму or да ти се невиди и "     " Or да ти еба майката Or курва Or шибан "insert profession " Or еби се Or боклук or деба твойта мама дееба Or бастун. But yeah по дяволите works
Po diavolite for Bulgaria is good, but not correct
Mostly we say "bahti", "basi", "deba, "daeba", "dagoeba"
Balkans legit got offended by the weak swear words you placed there
Prepare to get your mother jebana, OP
I'm sorry, you brought this on yourself
Po dyavolite is REAL mild
In bulgarian we would say something along the lines of "maika mu deiba" meaning fuck something's mom (applicable to virtually everything)
Pretty much the same for Bulgaria
"Po dyavolite" means pretty much "Damn it" or "to hell with it". Something like that
Should be the ol' reliable "Maika ti deeba"
OP failed miserably with most of Europe sounding like they're in 4th grade
"Po dyavolite" specifically is an artificially created term to translate "fuck" in movies while being very mild
Що не пишете на БГ ве маа му дееба?
The gold standard
Just "Deeba" at the least
In this case, it's not even fourth grade, nobody actually says "Po dyavolite" in real life
You can only find it in translated books or movies

I don't agree personally and have nothing against comparing the two
I do it often myself
But in this case in particular I can see how someone might think that
It's kinda stupid that information about the emergency European number starts off by telling us what the US emergency number is, no
And in fact half the message is about the US
Call it banter if you like but in that case we could at least diversify our banter to include other countries
Interesting values we have in Bulgaria
That 8C° must be from the weather station at Musala peak (i think it's the only such case on the map), but I've got no idea why it shows 15C° near Sofia (the capital)
Were those 16 degrees over Sofia recorded on some mountain top
Last couple of days it was 20 degrees after dark
There are some places like in Italy or Bulgaria where there are 25-30+ temperatures and then in between them 15 or 17, why is that
>but I've got no idea why it shows 15C° near Sofia (the capital)
Cherni Vrah (highest peak of Vitosha) also has a weather station
Should be the station on Cherni Vrah (highest peak in Vitosha mountain overseeing Sofia)
I can swear it was over 30 today
Even at 8pm the car said it was 22C outside
I'm pretty sure you can't fly drones over Paris
Yee Haw
Wait
Didn't the Russians start out in Kiev
Or are the Kiev Rus a separate entity altogether
Ah now I understand
Thank you
Having an Estonian name for a city doesn't mean that it is or ever was an Estonian city
You are confusing Pskov with [Pechory]
Your country first became independent in 1918 and certainly never included Pskov
So what does this have to do with whether Pskov was part of Estonia
Pechory (Petsery in Estonian) is a separate town from Pskov
Benis :DDD
Bulgaria is now on Russia's list of ''unfriendly countries''
It's an honour
Meet me at the bar, I'm buyin'!
Oh no
Anyways
Well that's a first
Finally some good news
As a Bulgarian, fuck Tsar Putin
WOOOOOO
I am surprised the list is not longer honestly
We're in, nice
We made it boys
And we're part of a positive list for once
cool
Good for us I guess
Amazing
We must stand by Ukraine against Russian aggression
Good
Twas about time
oh no anyway
They can do whatever they want
The Russian people and the Bulgarian people never forget their connection and the love for each other
The state can build a giant monument to their hatred for us, we'll just use it for the shade
I feel so proud of my country right now
I've been seeing people say "What would Russia / Turkey / x" want with Bulgaria for years now
Personally I don't know what the answer could be or why anyone would be interested in an impoverished shithole like Bulgaria, but apparently that's the situation and that has been the situation for the last ~1400 years
Its because there is yet another stupid spy scandal thats why
Lukashenko has annoyed Putin quite a lot, but Putin probably needs him for now
If Belarus gets integrated with Russia, it's game over for Bats'ka
I hope our stay is welcome
Happy to be here
Heeey, my bois
Thank you
I'm in, let's do it
my thoughts exactly
Why would they wanna invade Bulgaria
I hope the same thing
Russia is being slowed down thanks the idiotic government
Thanks
Well it's hard to explain
After years of our government  and prosecution doing nothing about information that Russia had repeatedly tried to poison a weapons manufacturer and his son who were arming Ukraine, they were at last spurred into action  when Czechia said that their deadly blast was meant to go off in Bulgaria and ruin the company's reputation
Now Russia got accused for 4 other intentional looking  explosions at  two of our arms companies and apparently the Salisbury duo were touring the country at the same time as some of the accidents
On one hand the weapons manufacturer, Gebrev, disputes some of our prosecution's accusations against Russia, on the other he accuses them of shielding the Russian spies
So for all of that we expelled a diplomat
And Russia's losing its shit
I think you were in this a couple days ago, but we have somehow managed to qualify
Eastern Europe
I'm dissapointed
There's a huge gay porn company there, so that might be why it's such a big number
Any argument against brexit applies to Scotland leaving the UK, much more strongly
Poor guy, can't catch a break from bullshit
I feel sorry for him
> Homo-Nazis
Lol
Reminds me of [Lady Gaga's music video for Alejandro]
Don't know how they asked the question but at least in Bulgaria you have to specifically ask Japanese or South Korean otherwise people lurch into thinking other nationalities
We think of Japanese as highly educated and advanced
In fact the most famous hotel (Marina) and best regarded hospital (Tokuda) in Bulgaria are Japanese or built by them
We'd hate Muslim for all eternity and what they did to us for 600 years
But we do love the jews though ️
"To feel like a white person" - Actual Bulgarian expression
This data makes us looks racist as hell
Hell yeah
most ppl older than 45 here are just close minded
Also we all hate the gypsy so
I am the most tolerant person you will meet but i still fucking loathe them
In what universe is Asian not a race
Also, how would you classify a gypsy
Asian
White
Arab
This is definitely coming from a person who has never lived near gypsies
Belgium, you can keep him
He's all yours
Borissov got upgraded
Close enuff
I just can't believe how this stupid retard is sitting(bulgarian PM)
had a layover along the way, got promoted, nbd
You really should have a better attitude to our newly conquered territories
Hey, Belgium borders the North Sea doesn't it
So now we have Bulgaria on 2 seas
One more and we are back to our ultimate form
You are scary
No, seriously
Did you know that in Netherlands they have this tradition
Saint Nicholas comes every year to give presents to the good children
And the bad children he takes with him when he leaves
Saint Nicholas comes with a ship
From Spain
And, most importantly, home to Saint Nicholas who brings presents to all good  Dutch children
The bad children get taken away from their families and taken to Spain
I am telling you - FOX news saw the parallel with trump's border practices
Ah yes, we have 3 words in common and the same royal dynasty AFTER we were freed from the ottomans
Same country tbh
Not like we have an entirely different history and descent
Maybe if you were able to understand what and how he is talking (which is not his only problem) you would know what i mean
We're the assholes voting for him
shame, really
Well, we kinda invade the northern Greek coast every summer, so you could say, we are almost there
And the dead ones which are magicaly voting and ofcourse - ciganite
It's ridiculous, isn't it
Ah yeah, fair enough
Still disagree that they are essentially the same seeing as Belgium is actually doing ok in the money and population departments while Bulgaria
Not so much
Ah my bad
Yeah, same for the Netherlands
He-wwo Mr Putin uwu
In the EU you get not 1, not 2 but 3 Steps to influence a bill
1: Vote on which elements will be in it
2: Is the proposition acceptable
3: Final vote if it should be accepted
This was step 1
Stop the Hysteria
That's how the EU is, the people there have dedicated their lives to writing regulation and it's the only think they are capable of, to them it's an instinct
Pirate more and you won't be affected
In the EU you get not 1, not 2 but 3 Steps to influence a bill
1: Vote on which elements will be in it
2: Is the proposition acceptable

This was step 1
Your local version of brexit
EDIT: What
It is an effective way to dodge EU regulations
Me too
Fuck this policy
A bunch of overpaid **and** easy to buy dicksuckers
I, too, would want to know more about this
AFAIK article 11 prevents people from showing thumbnails and snippets of news articles, like facebook and google do, but the hyperlinks themselves are fine
I don't have much info on the filtering requirements on article 13, but I have not seen any proof or documentation that says it will censor content, or affect memes in any way, besides the echo chamber
These types of filters would required an unimaginable amounts of computing powers, on par if not greater than Google itself
In all likelihood they'll put a filtering system on the filter, where if your IP is not from the E.U. the filter would give you an auto-pass
Alde is the only bigger party to vote majority against this proposal as well as the greens
>Then they wouldn't be required
Yes they would
The exception is for small sites, not for everyone
The rest would need Big Tech to scan the content
Yes, this is clearly a direct prerogative and not a vague, wishy-washy line that governments just put and ignore
Forget this map
That the US is more dangerous than Europe was obvious without statistics
But the US is more dangerous than a lot more countries, which will surprise people
Someone should make a the same map but for different underdeveloped and autocratic countries
For example, all of these countries also have a lower rate of intentional homicide than the US:
China, Iran, Syria, Libya, Sierra Leone, Lebanon, Tunisia, Kyrgyzstan, Turkey, Rwanda, Kenya, Somalia, Morocco, Egypt, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and even god damn North Korea
The US is actually in the bottom half in the world in this dataset
More countries have a lower, rather than a higher murder rate compared to the US
Zoom in and you will actually see its very dark red
Paldiski
>and cause moderate inflation
Inflation was already at 4
3% in 2008, 1
7% in 2009, 4
7% in 2010 and 3
1% in 2011
How much more moderate would you make it by printing money
Every summer I wonder how is Spain possible
fuuucking I was really enjoying the cool and rainy summer I've been having here in Germany
Begone heat
It is already 34 here in BG and it is already above my threshold
Anything above will make me want to die and I know that in Aug and Sep it is going to get even worse
Send help because I don't have AC at home and the one in my car doesn't work
Oh for fuck sake
At least we're not like south Spain
HELP
What's up with Ukraine lmao
I think if you have countries like Morocco and Algeria, then you should have all the countries in Northern Africa
They
Have
An APP
It guides people to threes that needs felling
Meanwhile my country has over 50% illegal barbarian deforestation
I'll be in my bunk
Very true words
I'm from Bulgaria and combined with the pro-Russia, anti EU sentiment some paid outlets harbour, there's the issue with our seaside basically being sold off to Russians
You won't believe how many Russians visit the sea each year and how many have properties
There are whole apartment complexes that are closed and for Russians, only
We can totally imagine Putin saying one day he has to save the mistreated fellow citizens in BG
Oh God
What happened
And here I thought the Germans were good at everything
Kawaii of the highest level
>Stalin actually had a mental breakdown for a few months after the invasion, he did not issue any orders which led to chaos at the front and only sped up the German advance
Not a few months, less than two weeks actually
He wasn't visited by generals but by members of the Politburo
And him not issuing any orders whatsoever in that period is a myth, AFAIK
Ironically, Stalin was absolutely right that the invasion was a very stupid idea for Germany
But still, he should have been more prepared, it's not like the Germans would have any leg to stand on if he had moved more troops to the border areas as their own troops were massed in Poland
And the Japanese invading from the east would have been the biggest logistical nightmare of all time (for the invaders), there was no practical reason for committing hundreds of thousand of troops for the defense of Siberia with the Germans being a much more obvious threat
[One million seems to be an enormous exaggeration]
Pretty much the reason neither Germany, nor Russia have recovered from these wars demographically even to this day
Losses like that create generational holes that can never be filled
Russia alone would have probably had a population of more than 200 million nowadays if it wasn't for the brutal losses
Europe's population as a whole would easily have crossed a billion people if it wasn't for the two world wars and the horrific consequences they had for our demography
It's honestly staggering how many people died, and how many weren't even born as a result of that
He made a famous speech on July 3rd, about two weeks after the start of the invasion
This made some historians claim he did nothing but hide before that but new evidence suggests that this is a myth
>Also famously a septic tank one time
Holy shit
Meanwhile, their northern neighbour Bulgaria fucked off all the way to the right
Also worth mentioning, if you zoom in you will notice that by far the larger part of people is between 20 and 35 years old
Gives me so much hope for my country
Spread the word that half my country doesn't have a working brain
big bang from geshev - fabricated audio tapes haha
Here's the deal, things are so fucked up that any new party that comes in power will undoubtedly be as worse as Borisov
But borisov has to go, 10 years is more than enough for you, snake
I fucking love my country
You have all my support from America
If anyone had any brain cells would know that these protests were initiated and paid by the oligarchs they arrested, prosecuted and gotten rid of in the past years
People can't even give a proper answer why they are protesting when interviewed by the media
They want change but change won't come from the leftists, only destruction
Elections are in a couple months
Yeah it's kinda sad
hopefully the outdoor nature of the protests will reduce the damage somewhat
Personally I try to improve my odds of not getting the plague by:
\- always wearing my N95 mask
\- going there by bike, and using the bulky bike frame as a barrier to help me keep my distance from others
\- trying to move towards parts of the crowd where more people wear masks
We did, but we didn't expect things to go this bad
Lol, you like the hat DPS gave you
True
It's good beer
That may actually be a terrible idea
As soon as something happens that reduces agricultural output (like crop failure or trade disruptions that cause food to rot before it could reach its destination) we'd have people starving
Overproduction is actually a pretty logical practice,  although it obviously has environmental drawbacks
No I'm  saying that a system where nobody starves and food is wasted may be better than  a  system where nobody starves and nothing is wasted, because the second   has no room for mistakes or disasters
I don't think you're getting anything
This is a comparison between hypothetical situations and which one we should be trying to reach
Ok, I think so too except your comment that I originally responded to  said the ideal was for everyone to be fed and for nothing to be wasted so I just pointed how the "nothing wasted" part may not be as good as it intuitively sounds to us
That was all
Of course I think the ideal is for everyone to be fed
You haven't been to Bulgaria, have you
I have, if after an hour of driving on highway your kidney stones haven't broken, it's a good highway for Bulgarian standards
In Bulgaria we watch Home alone thruought the whole month
Yeah, same in Bulgaria
Just a modern Balkan tradition
Cool
So what now
Where can I see who voted for what
Thank you
Wow wtf, even a little shipka monument and nevsky cathedral
Very nice
Some from Bulgaria that I noticed:
Alexander Nevski cathedral where Sofia is
The Nessebar windmill on the black sea coast
Rose valley in Thrace
Maybe now we can have animu movies in cinemas
In Bulgaria it's around 25, maybe a bit lower
Edit: But my classes have always been at around 28
In Bulgaria in my class there are 30 students
I’d say it’s 28-32 in Bulgaria
In Bulgaria that number would be around 25-27 if I can judge by my own experience
I've been in classes as small as 23 and as big as 30
>We have a shortage of teachers because the pay is so low and the job is so hard
I can confirm this
I'm a teacher by university degree, but I'm typing this from an office
I don't dislike the idea of being a teacher, but it's a lot of work for not a lot of money
Actually at the moment I make somewhat less money as opposed to if I had followed my original profession, but my current job is also a 100 times less stressful and less demanding than teaching kids about literature
And from my entire course of people (we had 24 graduates) I don't think anyone became a teacher after graduation - even this one girl we had who was supper diligent and both her parents were teachers as well
We don't keep in touch much, but I know where most of the best from our course are and neither of them is a teacher right now
So do part-time teaching, but that's about it
PS: Also, at the company I work, a lot of my colleagues are teachers by degree
I can think of at least 5 colleagues off the top of my head
My high school class was unusually big - 32 kids
Some rooms didn't have enough desks for all of us
As for primary, etc we usually floated between 20-25
Generally, I know that classes in primary school have been shrinking over the last 10 years, for example my little brother's class was 21-22 people, but when I was in primary school we were 27-28, in any case no less than 25
In my highschool there were classes with 30 people, my class had 29 in 8th grade, then it shrunk to 28, because a girl switched schools and left, then for some time we were 29 again, because they moved some dude from another class into our class, but later he was moved to another school and we remained 28 until the end
And this is all in State-run schools
>it's a lot of work for not a lot of money
Well what do you expect
The Bulgarian education system is an absolute joke
It's ridiculous how much time and money is being wasted to the detriment of young people across the country
After 12 years of this circus who in their right mind would want to stay in a school
I'm not sure if this is a regional/cultural thing or just some schools, but in my experience of our education system it felt like literally nobody ( not the students, and so not the teachers ) gave a damn about anything
This continued in university where they just screwed with you instead
&#x200B;
Looking back on that, i'm rather salty that the system is only concerned with dumping large masses of information in a compacted time frame rather than trying to optimize for comprehension of the material
And that compounds when it's coupled to previous information like for example you'd get with math
So as a result, you never learn to learn as it's all about memorizing the current relevant set of information as a standalone thing briefly, and then never use it again
Retrospectively, I can EASILY call the majority of the time i've spent in high school absolutely wasted
&#x200B;
So, what i'm trying to say is : Good, the system is rotten and you probably wouldn't affect it much, so keep your health and dont go near that trainwreck
It's not only that
As a teacher you can't really impose discipline anymore
When I was a kid if I disobeyed the teacher I'd either eat a slap or they tell my parents who would slap me at home
Now parents don't discipline their kids at home and the only tool the teacher has is giving bad grades, at which the kids scoff
Out of the 45 mins of a class 30 go towards beast taming and bargaining with a bunch of brats that don't respect anything about learning
And the last 15 are for trying to cram information in their heads
It's not just the education system
Parent's don't know how to do their own jobs as parents
Imo the system should be revamped a little bit like this:
Elementary school - You set the basics
Mathematics, languages, science, some arts
Middle school - You build a little bit more on the basics and teachers start to keep an eye on every student - in which subjects they are lacking and at which they are good
High school - Students go to special classes tailored for their particular skills and start preparing for the university
Students that are not good mathematics shouldn't learn complex geometry for instance
And those who are not good with languages shouldn't be forced into them
High school should focus on the student's individual abilities in the fields they are best at
Edit: You can keep some basic stuff in HS, maybe some algebra and Bulgarian for all, just to keep the material fresh, but the focus should be on the individual skills of the students
It doesn't matter if they respect learning because they're NOT learning
Learning is the absolute last thing our system is designed for
You can't force teenagers to spend 7 hours a day craming worthless garbage in 12 different subjects with no real use and expect them to care
Around 10-12 grade even the most well-behaved students in the best school in the oblast were fed up
And hitting them isn't discipline
>You can't force teenagers to spend 7 hours a day craming worthless  garbage in 12 different subjects with no real use and expect them to  care
There are some subjects that are an absolute must and which you cannot cut tho like: Bulgarian language
basic mathematics, basic science, Bulgarian history and basic human history, a foreign language (English to be exact)
Sure, there are some subjects that can absolutely be cut (like the second foreign language classes or IT)
A university course and self teaching will give you a lot more information on IT than a few vague classes in school
Music and art should also be only for specialized schools that focus on gifted kids
One good system is to use high school to focus on the individual skill of every student and tone down the other subjects like: Student has shown better grades or just general interest in mathematics during elementary and middle school and worse grades/less interest in languages
Then in high school that student should have more math and less languages - for example
But my point still stands
Children today have no incentive to learn
There is no detriment to not learning, and there is no discipline
Bulgarian language and basic mathematics should of course be taught, but literature should not he mandatory, and students are forced  to learn far more than basic math currently, even if it's completely useless to them
IT should be focused on more, not everyone goes to college
History and religion also have no place from  grades 1 to 4
They're there to instill nationalism and loyalty to the state, no other reason
There's no such thing as "basic science" in the Bulgarian education system
I agree students should learn what interests them Our current system uses technical and professional high schools but still have to learn all mandatory subjects
It's completely contradictory makes the whole thing pointless
As for your last point, you're forgetting they also have no *incentive* to learn, either
90% of the material is useless filler from communist times
Grades 1-4 are bloated
5-7 are mostly useless and high school is a disorganized mess with no clear goal or purpose
Literature should be mandatory because the culture of our civilization is kept in literature, and not just Bulgarian literature, but literature in general - Homer's works, Don Quixote, Shakespeare etc
They are important, but they are not suited for all ages
Young children shouldn't learn them, but teens should
Also literature is what makes a language a language
Without it the language is just a communication code
> IT should be focused on more, not everyone goes to college
But not everyone is good with IT either
Kids these days are computer-literate enough to handle themselves
Still special courses that help to those interested should exist
Now, as to if you want to be a programmer, well you'd better go to college
Especially college in Bulgaria is ridiculously cheap
You really don't have an excuse for not going unless there is a special issue preventing you from it
Religion - Yeah, that has no place in schools
I say this a a believer
History - Depends
I see your point and maybe you are right
Like grades 1-2 kids won't even comprehend something as complex as a nation's history, but grades 3-4 you should at least start to build it
However don't start with BG history but human prehistoric history, then the Ancient world etc
Actually in the teaching courses for the classes the history classes and literature classes do follow the same path
I think for instance in the 8th (can't remember) grade kids were supposed to start the year with the works of Homer and then move on to Bulgarian medieval literature
And the history classes from the same year also explored the same periods
So literature and history were meant to help each other out
And while the kids are learning about pre-history you should start teaching them about evolution in science classes (maybe the yearly program from MON is already like that, I haven't checked it in a couple of years)
> 90% of the material is useless filler from communist times
Like what
When I was a student we never even learned about communism in history class
Which a shame we skipped a big chunk of important history
Maybe today they teach it
My point is the basics have to be taught always, but once in high school focus should be put on the best subjects for each individual student
And literature should be mandatory
You can't have kids not knowing Botev or Shakespeare or Don Quixote
>Like what
When I was a student we never even learned about communism in history class
We learn about communism extensively in history class and there's no problem with that
It's history after all
I'm talking about the way the curriculum itself was built around the needs of the state at the time
Physics classes spend 3 years teaching us about electric grids in order to create a large pool of disposable engineers
Scientific subjects like Chemistry and Biology aren't taught in 12 grade but Physics is and it feels forced
And what do we learn
Space so they could rile up support for giving money for the (then) space race and 2
nuclear reactors because they were building Kozluduy
Cus if your citizens are dirt poor you better convince them that spending money on large projects instead of feeding them is a good thing
Same reason why the BEL exam is mandatory
To force a singular Bulgarian identity and make people love the country which is just codeword for the ruling regime (BKP at the time)
Yes, literature is important, but it shouldn't be mandatory
Most of it is pure nationalism (Botev) and only alienates young people because these values don't work in a modern context and can be downright dangerous
It only serves to make young people hate reading
Sure, not everyone, but not enough to warrant forcing it on everyone
As for IT, yes, you'd expect most to have a working knowledge of computers, but most young people use smartphones nowadays and I've definitely noticed that only certain demographics (gamers, programmers etc
) can actually do more than open a browser or make a presentation
Also, if you filter out most of the (subjectively) useless stuff you definitely have enough time for an IT course
>Same reason why the BEL exam is mandatory
To force a singular Bulgarian identity and make people love the country which is just codeword for the ruling regime (BKP at the time)
BEL exam is mandatory so you could prove you're not illiterate
Arguably mathematics should also be mandatory to prove you know algebra at least
>Physics classes spend 3 years teaching us about electric grids in order to create a large pool of disposable engineers
Well we kinda need engineers now
Sadly everyone is going for fancy degrees now like marketing, economics and psychology
All professions the state doesn't need and for whom there's little work
>Most of it is pure nationalism (Botev) and only alienates young people because these values don't work in a modern context and can be downright dangerous
It only serves to make young people hate reading
Sure, not everyone, but not enough to warrant forcing it on everyone
Sure he's controversial (he was a communist as well) but you have to learn how read beyond that and judge it as according to the times he lived in as opposed to the times we live in now
He was a major figure in Bulgarian history which should not be ignored
Once you start judging literature with the eyes of modern times you end up with stupid decisions like banning Mark Twain books because he uses the n-word
And lastly there are some classics that children simply must read
If we let children pick their own books for literature class we'll have a class discussion on "50 shades of Grey
" Exaggeration
Nah, I was on a train to Plovdiv a few years ago where a group of 14 year-olds were lively discussing it
I cringed a little but at least they were reading something
And I agree some books require a certain age
I was able to appreciate  "Under The Yoke" only once I entered university
As fo IT that suffers from the negative connotation that that's basically not a real class
When we had IT at school we just played ConQUIZtador - which was actually very educational
And as for when I had to make presentations for class I just searched in YouTube "How to make a presentation" or "How to edit
" or "Photo Shop Tutorial". You really don't need an IT class as long as you know English and YouTube
>BEL exam is mandatory so you could prove you're not illiterate
Well, if they managed to reach 12th grade, you'd expect them to at least be literate
That's the Bulgarian language part
The literary part has no purpose anymore
>Sadly everyone is going for fancy degrees now like marketing, economics and psychology
All professions the state doesn't need and for whom there's little work
Developed economies rely on the tertiary and quaternary sectors, so these degrees definitely have value for a country in the long run
>judge it as according to the times he lived in as opposed to the times we live in now
Therein lies the problem
I've yet to see a literature teacher who didn't apply these authors' vision to the modern world
I didn't intend to single out Botev, he's just the most prominent example of a revolution era writer whose work can be summed up as "Love thy country or be ashamed".    I'm an avid reader of history and politics
This line of thinking never ends well
>As fo IT that suffers from the negative connotation that that's basically not a real class
We probably spent 3 years learning what a mouse and keyboard is
All stereotypes have a grain of truth in them I suppose
>You really don't need an IT class as long as you know English and YouTube
Well, yes, but all the good English teachers realised long ago that they'd make more money as private tutors
(BTW your English is impeccable)
> Well, if they managed to reach 12th grade, you'd expect them to at least be literate
Oh, you'd be surprised how many students graduate with pretty poor grammar, but that's another story
As for Botev, I won't argue anymore
He was never my favorite anyway
I too dislike his hard nationalism
I don't like his super macho style of writing as well
I've had some literature professors tell me about Botev something along the line of: "Thank goodness he died before the liberation because had he survived he'd probably end up with a tarnished legacy
" And I agree
With his views he would have probably ended up like Stambolov - hero to some, villain to others and likely assassinated
Or as Harvey Dent said it " *You either die* a h*ero*, or y*ou live long enough* to s*ee yourself become* *the* v*illain*”. Well Botev died a hero
We have a lot more appealing poets than him in my opinion, like Vaptsarov
He might have been a communist but his style is simple yet beautiful
> (BTW your English is impeccable)
Thank you
It means those 5 years in the university (degree in Bulgarian and English) and before that 7 years of watching Cartoon Network as a kid weren't a waste of time
>Thank goodness he died before the liberation because had he survived he'd probably end up with a tarnished legacy
It's surprising to how many highly regarded historical figures this applies
I wonder if Levski would be so idolised today if he had lived long enough to get in the monarchy's way with his republican ideals
>Cartoon Network
Ah, yes, my favourite "educational" channel growing up
I remember constantly playing a PC game about them when I was a kid
Whole of Europe I would imagine
I remember when the first private national-wide channel in Bulgaria BTV lunched in 2000 and they were showing some Asterix and Obelix animations all day long
Good shit
Pretty sure the answer is "Everyone".
Hard  to believe this picture is real lol
Everything comes down to malevolent election interference by Russia
Unless Europe addresses that it will have to deal with more and more illogical politicians with self-destructive tendencies as heads of governments, as opposition leaders, as members of EP
> If they were still on the Drachma instead of the Euro there'd be more options available to reduce debt pressure
Yup, massive devaluation, Venezuela style
I don't think that would be better
Maybe a Venezuela scenario is exaggerated
But let's look at Turkey, similar in development and probably more diverse in exports - their currency has plunged 50% in a year, and the worst is still (probably) yet to come
The average salary in Turkey is now similar to that in Ukraine
Would you be happy if that happened in Greece
To be honest even now I can't tell if the standard is British English or US English
I think OP is just making a pun/reference
Allow me to explain
Cyberpunk is a term used to describe a specific form of science fiction
However in this particular instance I think OP is just making a reference to Cyberpunk 2077
If you're not aware what CP 2077 is, it's a highly anticipated futuristic video game that is being developed by CD Project Red
And if you're not familiar with CDPR, they are a game development studio from Warsaw and actually have a very good, rock solid reputation among the gaming community
You ever go back home from school alive just to flex on those Americans
(Same dead meme, but more grammatically correct)
Meanwhile in the US
I'm calling bullshit on "no data" for Lichtenstein, Vatican, Andorra San Marino and Monaco
They've been at a solid 0
Kinda yeah
This is why I refuse to move north
This
i just can't read it out loud without laughing out loud
Hello from the other side ... of the box
Wonder where rich people live nowadays
I thought the picture was perfect and then I saw the cat and that made it even better
Could have been photo of my grandma as well :)
just the cat is different color
Sounds like terrorism to me
I'd love to go to Uni there but most of their public universities don't seem to have Bachelors taught in English
So today I learned that having any sort of semi functioning social system means communism
good stuff
Stallone's fake Bulgarian passport found in a recent counterfeit bust in Bulgaria
It was used as a sample that counterfeiters show to the clients
I always knew rocky was one of us
technicaly,we do have a Stallone double in bulgaria
Heck yeah
It's a sample they show potential customers
The whole point is that everyone can tell it's not real, but at the same time looks real
Guess which party was caught running a corruption ring for selling  actual legitimate Bulgarian passports
That's right, the "patriotic, Bulgarian values" party
Of course, no consequences, they are part of the ruling coalition after all
Damn, I'm angry
I believe the second expendables was filmed there
And the team as a whole
And Mexico borders Texas but you can still picture the stereotypical cowboy and the stereotypical Mexican and they're nothing alike
Wow I didn’t know that
At the risk of revealing personal info, I know people that were extras in a straight to DVD Morgan Freeman movie that was filmed there
Shows that you haven't paid attention in [history classes]
Also, the brand Bulgari derives its name from, you guessed it, the Bulgarian ancestry of its creators
Also, cowboys and Mexicans could be much more alike than you like to imagine, outside of the movies
Haha, yep
They were a bunch of funny characters
Being a Bulgarian going to Carpathians, I thought I'm just going to see something very similar to Bulgarian mountains as is with most things being almost identical in terms of culture, nature and cities between our countries
Let me tell you it's totally different
Bulgarian mountains are amazing and looking massive as hell but the Carpathians are so much more edgy and feel a bit like the Alps
Transylvania and the Carpathians are an awesome site to visit and hike
Make sure you go there
I thought on posting it on r/MapPorn, but I realised someone could really create „porn“ with this
You messed up Macedonia's flag, but I don't really care, bc I hate them
Happy independence day Suomi
Definitely one of the first places on my list to visit eventually
Finland just seems cool
P.S: You are better than the Netherlands
That's for constantly blocking us from Schengen
So yeah Finland is better
And we beat you at football
And we aren't buying tulips
and ughh
aaa
WE HAVE MOUNTAINS
Trump should try to find a parking spot for an American truck literally anywhere in Europe
Also when you produce cars that consume 40 l/100km you can't expect good sales in a market that enforces high taxes on fuel
Trump is a wizard
He looks like he is about to start a trade war with basically the world and got us arguing about cars
Magic
Tesla is still an up an coming company
Their market share is pretty small even in the US
Don't get me wrong, if I had the money I would probably drive a Tesla
Buy I doubt Tesla is what Trump has in mind
My point is that there are huge differences in the markets
You can make a car for the European market and it will also fit in the American
The other way around is not straight forward
Simple example is: I can go to America and most likely will not have a problem driving an average rental car
An American comes to Europe and they need to actually request a type of rental car they are comfortable with (I.e automatic transmission, a bit bigger, etc)
Did the French leave Europe while nobody was looking
A friend of mine has an American boyfriend and when his parents come to visit, they find the small cars quite uncomfortable
Granted they are from Texas but still
They also found the parking spaces pretty small
It's nice and clean but is it just me or does it look like a terrible place to actually read
My friends' grandfather would eat his meals super fast, in seconds
He survived two WWs physically, but mentally it was something else
I thought that's a Muslim before I read the caption
It didn't make much sense lol
I support this
If they want to sanction France, Europe should sanction them
> Unless you of course think that calls for boycotts validate sanctions
I do, they're the same things basically
Only Muslim  countries get to avoid WTO penalties and act like nothing had happened if things normalise
Well Europe should react
China does  incomparably worse stuff to them and Muslim leaders sing it praises despite China not even being as relevant for their investments as Europe is
I guess the difference is they know China would swing the hammer if they acted this way
China doesn't just put Muslims into concentration camps (as if that's not the most horrible part) but it tries to suppress Islam on every front
Besides Muslim countries haven't complained only of Muhammad drawings
Erdogan raises his tone and flings insults for just about anything including things that didn't even happen
And his supporters follow his lead and hate Europe for it
There's definitely a contrast between what Europe and China do and who Muslim leaders criticise
Dude China has done a laundry list of things to infringe on the rights of Uyghurs and to a lesser extent other religious minorities
Whether you think you could possibly justify them, my point is Muslim leaders, some of which are real snowflakes, have a lot of reasons to be angry with what China is doing
But they're not which shows their hypocrisy and how they don't really stand for the things they say they stand for
>Since Turkey has been fuming at China non stop
I could be wrong but from what I've heard Erdogan has mellowed his tone a lot towards  China recently
> Muslim leaders have been to these camps
You think they believe you guys who bomb them all the time
Ahahaha
I think they don't give a crap just like every religious hypocrite in history hasn't. Christianity says it preaches love, Islam says it preaches peace, meanwhile all they do is murder people by the millions
And the corrupt leaders of dictatorships are the last people to actually care about people's lives
China pays them and makes it conditional on them shutting their mouths so that's what they do
einz, hier kommt die sonne
Don't be a shitty loser
Damn, Turkey, what the hell
Wow that's abysmal and depressing
It’s clear the UK is going down the hill sharply
Watch the movie Brexit to see how it all unfolded
It’s sad to see the mass brainwashed
Would be glad if we build stronger protections on how our data is harvested and used against us as it can happen in more countries without definite action
We don’t want this , most of the Uk doesn’t want this
Ahh
the EU has to make it hard for the UK to leave so the rest of the EU states don't get ideas or otherwise everyone would want to leave
The fact is EVERYTHING has been rejected by parliament, so if the EU wants a deal, it needs to offer a bunch of unicorns
Happy birthday, Romania
From your southern neighbours, Bulgaria
We need to go in the streets, emails and upvotes are easily ignored
It's not like they don't know this is hugely unpopular
It's not the first time the EC has tried to pass bullshit copyright laws either
We need some massive protests against the ideas the EU is pushing in regards to internet copyright and censorship
I love them soft boiled with a bit of paprika
We keep eggs in the cold isles in Easter Europe, too
At least in Bulgaria and Greece
Americans may've invaded a place or two or ten, but occupation, no, don't think so
Imagine the view from up there
Juxtaposition with that building there on the picture is just perfect
I mean it's small, but netherland in translation means low lands
Don't click, it's better as Batman
> lots of small (between 1000 and 3000) villages
These are actually *big* villages
More Brits have heard of Bulgaria than Ireland
Those are definetly trolls
There is no way they dont know the one country they have a border with
Fingols mad
It's probably because very few people know anything about estonia to have an opinion on it
While Bulgaria is Sunny Beach and English pensioner's retirement home
I think Bulgaria might be because of the large number of British tourists that come
A lot of people have either been in Bulgaria or know someone that has
I hate that place
>but still refuse to learn the language of their country just because of their bullshit ancestry
What's the problem with them not learning Romanian
How does that harm anyone but themselves
Or perhaps (judging by your hatred of them having their own schools and signage in Hungarian) the problem is that they haven't stopped speaking Hungarian
We mostly export our power to neighboring countries
We export so much that at some places we have to import power from other countries too, because of corruption
We also have zero plans to phase out coal outside this GIF
I mean we could have made some commitment without reading the text but there is no plan
Well maybe, problem is our electricity bills (from what I know) are much higher than our neighbours, which considering how much we produce should be te opposite
Axis 2 Electric boogaloo
Reminds of me this gem: "A German court has ruled against deportation of refugees to Bulgaria if they had been registered there first upon entering the European Union because Bulgaria wasn’t a safe country of origin
\>  A German court refuses to extradite a German citizen
A country declines to extradite it's own citizen
Isn't this standard
Yeah it really sucks
In theory internal extraditions should be a good tool to fight crime as even petty thiefs are international with open borders
If it's a more serious crime sure, but I'm thinking more along the lines of a Bulgarian pick pocket getting identified in Germany but escaping back to Bulgaria before being arrested
If they are arrested in Bulgaria and sent back to Germany there is a good chance victims will testify and they will be convicted
If the trial is in Bulgaria I'm thinking few people would bother just to testify how they lost a wallet with €50 and the thief is acquitted
There is a lot of international petty crime these days where the location of the trial will make a difference because the people involved would be too inconvenienced
Bulgaria and it's a leading news story in all media every single day
Fuck Summer
Way too hot
When Finland has higher temperatures than Hungary
Im still waiting for the real summer here in Bulgaria
10C is perfection tbh
Shout-out to the EU
Idk about the others but no way Italians or the French have such high percentages
I call bullshit
One of these is not like the others
I feel this proves that one good thing came out of the Soviet occupation of eastern Europe, literacy
Guess I'm a robot for getting annoyed by the cookie banners/pop-ups
Slava Romania and the Romanian people
A Bulgarian here, we're still trying to fight too and honestly the progress has been slow
Though we are on our way to slowly ridding the government from these scum, we only need a strong and capable leader to take up the job and fasten the process
Good luck in the fight brothers
Don't go easy on them
This is some fairytale shit
Veliko Tarnovo on steroids
So like the french pronunciation of croissant but with a "sch" instead
I was joking
Fucking Soros ruining the beautiful Hungarian beaches too
You could say there's lodz of snow
OKe I'm out
I get that these engines are better in that they don't steal your data but I've yet to find one as good as Google at finding the result I'm looking for
There's something quite funny about the only language with a Slavic derived word for snow being Romanian :D
Pretty much all slavic countries say "снег" except Bulgaria where it's "сняг" bulgarians don't give a shit do they
>10 years for 10km autobahn etc
So it's not only us then
this gives me hope
Tories take credit for EU directive
This is why Britain voted out really - their politicians take credit for all the positives while projecting their screw ups on the EU
> That doesn't excuse the stupidity and gullibility of the voters, the individuals
Why are there so many stupid and gullible people here is another question
Ughh, the biggest problem of all
Not just in Britain or the US but in my country as well
Things would be so much better if it weren't for so many voters being gullible and stupid
Ew it looks discusting how can somone drink sausage
That looks like the drink of dreams
I approve
Why is it OK to insult millions of people who speak slavic language
Why has the word ''Slav'' become a synoynum for an uncivilized thug
So someone in Poland does something, and now ALL Slavic speakers are guilty
SLAVIC is A language family, NOT ethnic group
When someone in Romania does something stupid, where are the ''Latin'' memes
I feel ashamed :(
It's a huge luxury as stated above
If you DO travel its reserve the tickets 6+ months early at least and keep a very tight budget until then
Happy independence day Latvia
May there be many potatoes upon you
