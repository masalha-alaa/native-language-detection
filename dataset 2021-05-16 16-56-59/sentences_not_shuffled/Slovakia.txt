We were so nazi that even the real nazis were shocked how good nazis we made
Wait when did that happen
I remember that we invaded Poland so well that Kraut told us to slow down
But I haven’t heard of any big massacres the Slovaks commited
I mean we paid them to take our jews
And our troops were disciplined, always there, always ready
Basically even the nazis that did not believe we could have been germanized were kinda surprised how compatible we were with the 3rd reich and the germans
It would take only 100k german families to fully germanize us
Hungary
I don't hate them, I just want the Pannonian sea back
There's really only two kinds of people I dislike
People who dislike others because of their country of origin and the Dutch
My choice is clear
Do paroma s... Vatikánom
I know Perun is proud and smiling at me
Some time ago, when facebook was just starting to be popular here, there was Slovak facebook group named "we want sea instead of Hungary", so you know
Hungary
Joke's on you, now you have to go around because no boats go through there
you are right we should expand it, Hungary it is
No country, no problem
And here, /r/AskEurope, you have a response from a Hungarian; translation: ''Slovakia does not exist''.
Just after I said that I don't hate them
oh well, nothing new :)
Look I just want us to have a sea in our country, it's not my fault that the sea happened to cover most of their area :D
>"Balaton expansion initiative"
Hahahahahahaha
*2016 flashbacks*
For Hungary it was when our king managed to escape the ottomans,. But he drowned in the river and it forced the kingdom into a two way, latter a three way fight for Hungary
[Ever heard of Lunik IX
] But that's a combination of poverty and a very trashy lifestyle
I wonder if the reason is that not enough consumer products are manufactured in Russia, or way too much of them is exported
the most infamous place in all of Slovakia got even more known thanks to Bald and thats good, i doubt it will ever get solved but the more attention it gets, the more necessary a solution will be
Oh wow
This doesn’t look like Italy at all
More like Slovakia hah
Excuse me, how can you eat a month for 100€-200€ in Norway
Yes
For all I've learned from hobby finger-travelling on Google Earth, Lunik IX might even be worse than Łódź.
I am not sure, perhaps decorations
Well its sunnynthere, so it might be cleaning day, they can dry washed carpets
[Bald] explain
Ah, the nostalgia
I managed to get by with the same as a student, but I am surprised it is doable also in Norway
Do you have Vifon soups there
Yes, definitely
I use English everyday when I’m online, I watch everything in English, I used to attend international - English high school and now I have a few lectures in English in college plus most of my friends are from foreign countries and I talk to them daily
So I basically only use Slovak to talk to my family and well at college
I sometimes completely forget some word in Slovak so I just replace it with the English word, luckily everyone I know can understand English but if I were to speak with someone who doesn’t, it’d be soo hard for me to not include any English words
especially in a casual conversation when some English words I wanna use can’t even be translated into Slovak
And I also find myself translating words from English to Slovak a lot - I know what the English word means but I have no idea how it’s said in Slovak
Not English, but German, my Slovak is slowly deteriorating
Yes
You know it’s bad when you actually think in English instead of your native language
Sometimes, someone asks me something in Slovak and I respond in English
Honestly, many of my friends tell me that I sound American, I don't know if that's true , because you hear yourself differently
But for the most part, I am satisfied with my English accent
I personally do like my accent, or I mean I don’t really have any strong opinion on it since it’s kind of like neutral / American but I do not like the stereotypical Slovak accent
I love ze german accent
No idea, but I personally value freedom Android system gives me
iPhone essentially locks you to use other Apple devices to get the best value out of it
I was genuinely shocked you can't send files over Bluetooth (not like it's something you would use everyday, but there was certain situation where it was the best option)
You need iTunes to sync files while with Android I can just plug it in to any PC and it acts like another drive
Customization is way better on Android as well
And the list goes on
Same here
Iphone is for girls and guys who need to compensate
It's like owning a big car
>I personally value freedom Android system gives me
Unlike americans, we value our freedom highly
I contrary think quite the opposite with camera, i think the newest iphones have the best camera on the market at least for my, but as you mentioned the iOS is the problem for me personally, it is the same with macos, you just have to do things one certain very unnatural way
I'm partly ashamed of Bratislava
I have naturally a bit higher expectations for capital cities, moreover for a place the most of foreign tourists visit it's often not exactly representative
Living in Bratislava now and I can say I liked it better before when I went there only for a trip
First of all, Old Town is really beautiful and the best Bratislava can offer
Besides that perhaps some nature around, Dunaj and that’s it
The other parts are really ugly and not even worth going to (Petrzalka especially)
I am sorry to hear your bad experience
I’ve been to Zilina multiple times and loved it there (though not much to do)
Slovakia is notoriously known for it’s beautiful nature and history (castles, ruins, mountains)
For the next time I recommend seeing Oravsky Podzamok (60km from Zilina), High Tatras (a must), castle in Trencin and Beckov castle
I’ve been to all these and they were magnificent places worth spending time to
Definitely
A lot of people underestimate Slovakia but it has just a plenty of hidden gems
And also is cheap (for german salary) ^^
Germany's personal assistant number 5, who Germany has no idea exists
Goes into a panic attack every time Germany sneezes
Is still in love with his ex
Don't mention hockey in front of him
Really likes working at the company but bitches nonetheless to not seem too eager
Is involved in some shady shit in his personal life, but vows to get his shit together lately
Overall a quiet nonessential personnel in the office
When he remembers he exists during hockey season, Finland likes him for some reason
That guy that is neither popular, nor unpopular
Can lowkey talk about anything with anyone but isn't good at anything in particular
Also always talks about cars
Thanks for the pizza
I do like some American expressions more (like chips instead of crisps) but I want and need to be consistent as a future translator
Bruh I taught myself to speak in a stereotypical British RP accent, cause I hated my native one
Then I spent some time in the US and now it's a mixed mish mash or accents
Lately I caught myself pronouncing some d's in certain words like an Indian, since I have Indian coworkers
Well tap water is free so they caught you on that
I always ask for tap water and never really had a problem
The toilet pay thats usually just like euro and I am glad to give it, because it keeps the place clean and also gives some money to person working there
I have seen public toilets in usa
I would not touch shit there
Its often a place where homeless do drugs and have sex apparently
I am a girl so going to a dirty toilet is bit too much for me
Kajetán (read: kahyetaan)
I didn't even know that the name existed until a politician of said name Made a big scandal with the state's reserves
Sorry if im wrong but didnt Cyril and Methodius invent the alphabet by request of Rastislav of Great Moravia
I thought they invented the base of the language in Great Moravia but when they were exiled by Svätopluk their students invented cyrillic in Bulgaria
the word robot is czech
well yes, but thats essentially what i said, they invented the base of the alphabet - glagolic in great moravia and their students invented cyrilic in bulgaria, i just wasnt sure if cyrilic was a based on glagolic or not
You guys don't have the Soros conspiracy
Basically that any progressive idea is seen as Soros paying people to spread his agenda
Soros is behind everything
Even pays of president
Also chem trails
Oh no, he got UK too
Reading these comments is hell
But this idea is me like, so (I)'m join even if it looks ridiculous
Not know what more say so have yourself beautifully
We are already started the boycott on the pitch yesterday against Cyprus with a shit performance like that
Boycott all sports events, tbh
> shows missing coolness
What is this supposed to mean
We have this guy called Andrej Danko
it is really hard to explain
Basically everything he said/done was stupid
you could do whole documentary series about it ! it's impossible to estimate exactly what's stupidest they said xD
Our former parliament speaker denied we have capitalism in Slovakia
Don't forget our former president, Ivan Gasparovic
"Everything was clearly written down, in white on black
He called the UN (in Slovak it's Organizacia Spojenych Narodov) as Organizacia Spojenych Nadorov (United Tumours)
And more
That dude is legendary for his speaking skills
I also remember how Róbert Fico said: "You can rest assured that I won't be doing politics in 2014 anymore
"I dont need paper when i read" - kpt
Andrej Danko
At least he was honest with his voters
Whats the "work" thing you all germans talk about
Because: Bjork, Sigur Rós, Ásgeir, Ólafur Arnalds
Such a small country with so
many great artists
I never really forget about countries
I mean I barely ever think about countries anyway but yeah
I have never seen you guys in here, hello
Fillibuster always sounded like a type of cop
"Sir the victim was killed by the Fresh Prince of Bel Air"
"Alert all available fillibusters, we have a born and raised Philly to bust
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
TBH no, but seeing this, I remembered I dreamed today about playing with Lego again and I wonder if Lego catalogues are still published
You could still find a stack dating from 1994 to the early 2000s in my children's room
I mean, yeah, Lego is Danish, but close enough
Yes, but only occasionally
Also, they are pretty THICC
And by the way, I also wonder - if you were shown a particular Lego brick and was asked if you owned it; if so, which model did it come from and what other characteristic pieces did the model consist of - would you still be able to tell
I seriously haven't met many
I see we are more like envious of them
At least I am
I am really impressed wirh what Germany managed
Its one of my totally favourite countries in Europe
Most anti german sentiment comes from Kremlin bots and trolls
They are very anti eu and the germany is seen and stabilising nation of EU
But pay no mind to those people
I generally feel it extremely stupid to blame the current generation for what their ancestors did
Its just looking for ways to still be a victim
The same way I don't like a white guilt thing
Because to me it feels like they want to play the victim, and feel súperior to other groups, which the opposite thing we should do
We should work together and not dwell on old history
And thats why I like Germany
Like seriously lost two wars, got absolutely anninhalated and now are one of the most prosperous and stable countries worldwide
And they had become such a puppy that I don't see any aggression coming from the ever again
Plus Germany gives us jobs
And welcomes us in much more than UK ever did
Some people that know history could be angry, but overall people here glorify germans as the hardest workers on the planet earth and say that everything made in Germany is top quality
Many of you probably cant relate, but i thought that "Černá Hora" beer is from Montenegro, because montenegro is literally being called "Čierna Hora" in slovak
Turned out to be czech, for like 800 years
I always thought that Koh-I-Noor Hardmuth was Danish or Norwegian (as Nór means "norwegian person" in Slovak)
Turns out, it's Czech
Robot is from Czech Republic originally
you can look it up  .... edit: I thought we are talking about words where do they come from not brands sorry
football fans know, because RB creates many plastic clubs that everyone is angry on
I knew it was German since a lot of ads, altough dubbed still displayed the original text: "Haribo macht Kinder froh"
What, I thought it was totally Austrian
I would not be able to tell the difference if someone put Porshe, Ferrari and Maseratti jn front of me
So where is Porche from
I also assumed north or Italy
Yes, we still kinda are
We work like china, one country two systems :D
It is actually a great beer, at least i like it
Stuttgart
Well that I didn't expect
And they do look the same to me
I will not be as positive as others
It depends on the country
Western Europe generally benefits from it
Some post communist countries gerelly suffer from it
The reason is either lack of finances or that government/hospital management steal the finances meant for modernization of the hospitals for themselves
Sometimes it's both
E.g. in Slovakia the state of hospitals is alarming
Some buildings are on the edge of collapsing
Doctors and nurses are running away to Czechia or Germany for better work environment and so on
People have higher chance to die or suffer complications from treatable diseases
Regardless of that I think the USA is wealthy enough to make universal healthcare work and benefit from it
The main focus for you should be to regulate prices first tho since even prices for medicine or equipment are several times higher than those in Europe
Doing that could help to make the healthcare more affordable even without government funding
With our reservers of mineral water
We flush toilets with it aswell
There is no running water in Slovakia that you cannot drink
Yes, very common, I do it every day
Our water quality is very good
what you drink daily is not always what you offer to your guests
in Slovakia, guests must get something fine -- alcohol or cola or coffee or mineral water
Drinking tap water is standard
But we love to drink bottled sparkling mineral water
I hate bottled water
With a passion
It is truly one of the most evil things to ever be designed on this planet
It’s fucking atrocious
It makes me so angry
I hope for the sake of our planet you are not one of the people drinking bottled water
Yeah because I use english a lot and I am also taking French lessons, while now trying to pick up some quick Spanish for my trip
I get so confused sometimes
I black on words a lot
Way too often to be bearable for me
Most of the time I'm really ashamed of myself when trying to translate some more complicated text in real time for someone
Few days ago I tried translating text to Slovak for my dad and for the love of god I wasn't able to translate the word "privacy". So I just stood there describing it and waving my hands around until I just gave up and used Google translate
A few people told me to read more books in Slovak
So I tried
And after 4 large books covering history of art I can conclude that I'm a lost cause
For me all the time
, but it generally depends a lot on how did you learn English and how much do you use it
I believe you can learn a language better if you learn the meaning of words in the language itself, as opposed to learning translations, so I started using Oxford/Webster dictionaries instead of English-Slovak dictionary as soon as I could understand them
Also as a Software developer, even when I work for a local company, I use more English than Slovak, because all the documentation for tools I use is in English and the docs/comments/strings we write are usually in English too, because every logical software company knows targeting the whole English speaking word makes more sense than targeting a small country with 5M population
In the capital city of Bratislava – dont talk shit about the city
In the whole country of Slovakia – NEVER refer to us as Eastern Europe
We are Central Europe :D If you start calling Slovakia an eastern european country in Bratislava, in a bar, pub or club, we will get angry
we like to think that we developed pretty quickly after the fall of communism, faster than the eastern nations
Obviously it doesnt matter, but the mentality here is that we work hard to be a developed, modern, western country like France, Germany or Austria, but we are just a few years behind bc of communism
(obviously that's a stretch, but who doesn't dream)
The word felvídek or "upper hungary" is pretty big fight starter
Who the fuck would do that
In Slovak the official name for the Kingdom of the Netherlands is Holandské Kráľovstvo, so yeah
Haha funny language
My most favourite travel experience ever is when we were with a guy from Apulia and he ranted, definitely ranted when he saw a cucumber on a pizza in Bulgaria
Aww going to restaurants with him was always an experience
Miss him
I hate this so badly man
Only you can
We understand each other, so there is no reason to speak a language you can't speak
If you are from CZ, speak Czech, 0 problems with that, everyone will understand you perfectly
If not from CZ, maybe try English since your accent in Czech could complicate things I guess
But we wont get mad over these petty things
<3 Come again
Yeah imhd forums are very toxic :D
Please try again <3
Thank you
Visit again
The city is sick <3
Drink ?
I will kill a child
Never had bad schnitzel
We actually do have an alternative "Nizozemsko" literally meaning "Low Lands" but it is very rarely used, almost always in connection with Benelux as a whole
Keep your smelly horses out of here
Weirdly enough that name is not that hard to pronounce lol
If I pronounce it right that it
Love it
Wine is pretty good, yes
It's no France or Italy, but we have some lesser-known wineyard areas that are considered premium good
Beer is worse, most big brands are owned by Heineken and only the small brewers are worth a shot
Czechs are way better at beer than we are:)
If you have Pilsner Urquell in Norway (it's all over the world), it's like a flagship of all Czech beers, a national pride almost, so I'd definitely recommend it, even though it has nothing to do with Slovakia
Yeah what can you do
They are very obsessed with public transport and sometimes have radical opinions about how the city or public transport should look like - without actually ever doing anything about it
No worries:)
You may get a valaška for that
Edit: Valaška is a weapon, tool and walking stick used by slovaks and rusyns
It is longer, lighter and thinner axe that could have been concealed in your shirt since axes were forbidden to carry around
Jánošík, our folk hero and legend, had a magic valaška which he used to steal from rich and gice to the poor
(Slovak Robin Hood)
> Beer is worse, most big brands are owned by Heineken and only the small brewers are worth a shot
Czechs are way better at beer than we are:)
When compared to Czech beer, it's definitely weaker, but it's not bad at all and since Zlatý Bažant '73 came, it has probably become my favourite mass produced beer, I rank it even higher than Krušovice or Pilsner
Svijany is probably a bit better, though
Ehm if you ever wanna try some good Slovakian beer, I would say, yes small breweries
But Urpiner for me
Tasty and rich and . They have many types, but their 16 can get you pretty wooed in head
I only know 73 from the ads (i work in advertising so I couldnt not notice it), but I will definitely try it:)
I don't think it's funny, but Slovakia is 2nd racist country in Europe
I think 85% Slovaks are very friendly when they are talking to other race
But when they are alone they are talking 20+ minutes about how they met other race human
I knew I would find this here
I mean all other races, for example people who are from other country as Slovakia and has different skin
There is a pack of cigarettes (Camel I believe) that are €2 in slovakia
Reminds me of "my grandpa died in German concentration camp during WW2
he fell down from a gun tower" joke
I don't see it as awkward
What happened, happened
If someone chooses to be bitter about it or judge you based solely on what your ancestors did in different circumstances, it's their fault
I freaking love discussing WW2 with Germans, they are extremely self aware and knowledgeable on the subject
Also often on WW1
Much better than discussing colonialism with Brits
They seem to be a bit dismissive of the existence that
Also of course depends really easy at university where people studied the subject than pub talk
French are really good at self despicable treatment
Also I feel within Europe they are the best when it comes to discussing politics and philosophy on daily basis
Some of thr best philosophy discussions in cafes ever
For us it can get a bit heated when it generational change and Russia related questions
Or Hungarian
But I believe young people, especially the ones i meet on EU exchanges are beyond this and can converse as masters
Basically it's almost always only Hungarians
I remember seeing a lot of comments in Youtube videos about Slovakia claiming : "Slovakia should not exist" or "Felvidék(Northern Hungary aka Slovakia) belong to us".
In certain video game I once said I am from Slovakia(when people asked) and suddenly Hungarians started about how was Trianon unjust etc
Few weeks ago there was Czechoslovak games sale on Steam and ofc there were Hungarians in the comments(Twitter) claiming same things
Hungarians just won't let go of the past no matter what
If I was like them I would still blame them for Magyarization or when they literally attacked Czechoslovakia
But hey why should I blame current people for 100 years old events right
But Hungarians just do not care
I was told that majority of rural Hungary is like that
Ofc not all the Hungarians are the like that
It can also get a bit uncomfortable between Czechs and Slovaks when discussing the Czechoslovak partition and Slovak "independence" after the Munich Betrayal
You mean you guys dont have Russian accent
Like people [here]
To be fair I picked up the fact they speak czech because the narrator told me
I thought it was some other slavic language
But you should see how big russian accent other czech characters had there
Yes, we say ahoj, dobrý deň, nazdar, zdravím, čau
Also we generally greet people in the countryside and small towns
Corruption
In Slovakia on Ester man spill water on girls,  and chase and spank them with sticks
Střílej, střílej
You have just one Slovak politician and that's all you talk about
I can't see how this is going to end in eastern Europe
Torrents stopped over here when new Netflix like websites rised up
And even when it is illegal, no one ever was punished and can't really be, unless it is going to be someone who makes money or of it
People would go nuts if they just cut them off from pirate media
I can't seriously imagine politician or police officer who would try this
I mean
why
Exactly
You are in the wrong part of the world, you belong to us
Christianity
Heavy drinking
Shitty weather
Potatoes
Sherpas
Check
I meant shepherd
Šťastné a veselé od Slovákov
"Bulgarian constant", a term used mostly in construction and engineering, for a number made up ad hoc, in order to formally meet standards or requirements
Edit: more generally, any arbitrary made up number added into a mathematical formula without rational justification, in order to compensate for discrepancy between its theoretical result and practical observation
May also apply to experimental physics, accounting, statistics, macroeconomics, logistics, etc
Maybe I was too specific when I brought up construction workers, because Bulgarian constants are applicable virtually in every field of human activity, like school science projects, when you've accurately measured several related physical quantities, yet somehow they do not fit the formula you are expected to prove; accounting (everyone's favourite), macroeconomical analyses, general statistics
Last month in Slovakia the incompetent opposition won by quite a margin
Keep hoping
BTW I also voted for one of the 5(!) opposition parties
I was also impressed by their portrayal of Kenya
I am no Kenyan so can't patronise it but i lived there and love tge country so much i think the managed to capture the contrast and the classes of Kenya in a fairly good way
Especially liked the women portrayal too, the moderator and his mom work
I met so many amazing women in kenya who were doing a lot for the community, so it was nice to see in American tv
And the matatu wars are kinda true
We say the same about people who study useless majors
(Philosophy etc
Flipping burgers
It's went so far that a pretty big college used it as an ad campaign: "Study in the right place, and you pave your future
Choose the wrong one, aand you're back to flipping burgers
When someone thinks Slovakia and Slovenia is the same country
"Everyone In Slovakia walking the streets is annoyed"
That's what my german/american friend said
My grandpa thinks , that everyone in California carries a Swiss Army Knife because of MacGyver
That's exactly what every tourist sees
Alright, you win
that’s really something
Because we are
Situácia je na piču a to každý vie
I don't know
It's not that empty anymore
I've been there a few days ago and it seemed like all the time
But I'm not a local and I'm wrong
Maybe go visit some other landmarks like Říp or Ještěd.
I would love to know answer to this question as well, especially for places like Curacao or French Guiana
ARTICLE 1
(1) The Slovak Republic is a sovereign, democratic state governed by the rule of
law
It is not bound to any ideology or religion
(2) The Slovak Republic acknowledges and adheres to general rules of
international law, international treaties by which it is bound, and its other international
obligations
Article 1
(1) The Slovak Republic is a sovereign, democratic state governed by the rule of law
It is not bound to any ideology or religion
(2) The Slovak Republic acknowledges and adheres to general rules of international law, international treaties by which it is bound, and its other international obligations
It is pretty similar to Czech Republic, I think because both originated from Czechoslovak constitution
**Article 1:**
The Slovak Republic is a sovereign, democratic and legal state
It is not tied to any ideology or religion
(1) The Slovak Republic is a sovereign, democratic state governed by the rule of law
It is not linked to any ideology, nor religion
(2) The Slovak Republic recognizes and honors general rules of international law, international treaties by which it is bound and its other international obligations
I like that it mentions that our government shouldn't be linked to religion
Also, I like to think that the second part is indirect reference to Czechs whom didn't fulfill Pittsburgh treaty
The Slovak Republic is a sovereign, democratic and legal state
It is not tied to any ideology or religion
It does sound nice, though it would also be nice to have Kirchensteuer and separation of the church and the state
Some of our politicians should re-read this part
Currently, rhere is a loud group of very devout Christians in our parliament who would like to restrict or even *ban* abortion (ĽSNS party comes to my mind- they are basically far-right Christian traditionalists who *really* love to flirt with neonazism and use the word 'liberal' as an insult; there is also a Christian wing in OĽaNO which many people somehow overlooked during the parliamentary elections)
Also, let's not forget that most of the parliament passionately denounced our ombudswoman's report (congressman Vašečka from OĽaNO called it 'rainbowy' for including her complaints about the state of LGBT+ rights in our country, which didn't even make most of the ombudswoman's report)
For example, a few deputies wanted to start a parliament session with Lord's Prayer
[there is nothing more Czech than a pub]
Note the old guys singing songs, smoking, having plemty of beer in a classic wooden decor with dark green cloth on the table
And don't forget the coaster holder
Was it before or after they start dancing on tables
As an avid skier I hate apre ski
I don't need bunch of drunkards on slopes
When I visited with a cruise ship of 4,000 people and we all took the commuter trains to Stockholm, people seemed rather confused about our presence and why the train was packed on a Saturday morning
I was just giddy because I love Sweden
Was supposed to spend 4 days around NYE in Stockholm this winter for my 30th, but COVID
Hopefully this year
I have lived for 7 years in Prague
I am also a czech citizen
The roma villages
So the east around Spis
There is a lot of racism against them too
However I would never ever want to be born there
Imagine being a kind and growing up in a really poor place with a different hierarchy and even caste system
And definitely do not want to be a girl born there
The central south of the country
Dying out regions, the highest rates of unemployment, no big towns (the biggest town in the 6 000 km^(2) area is Lučenec with population of less than 28 000), difficult transport options
Being a formerly relatively rich industrial region of Austria-Hungary, the region is full of valuable cultural heritage, nowadays often falling apart in run down towns
The regions suffered from depopulation, decline of industry formerly run by the aristocracy and finally, after the fall of the former regime, lack of job opportunities
The situation seems to be similar on the other side of the border in central northern Hungary, forming a "cross-border" poor region
Another choice would be the easternmost part of the country
Again high unemployment, difficult accessibility, far from the economic core of the country in the west
I feel sorry for the effort the people have to make in order to make living, a lot of people works abroad or in Bratislava, commuting long distances
The East
Wages are much lower, unemployment much higher, alcoholism also much higher, many more ghettos and there is nothing there
One of my closest friends is from Lučenec and he considers it the worst place in the world
Yes, the reason is obviously communism, not the west fucking up east germany after reunification
The fact that we split from Czechia a **long** time ago
90% of the time when I say that I'm from Slovakia the immediate response is "ah, czechoslovakia
And that Czechoslovakia was a federation of two sovereign countries, so the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic existed since 1969
And that there was a so called "Hyphen War" about the new name of Czechoslovakia (Československo) in 1990 after the fall of communism
Slovaks wanted to write the name with a hyphen (Česko-Slovensko)
As a result, the new name was "Czech and Slovak Federative Republic" and in Slovakia, Československo could have been written with a hyphen (Česko-Slovensko)
It is still the only right way to write it in Slovak
And that Czechoslovakia didn't split because people wwanted it - actually, there was no referendum and the surveys showed that the majority in both republics wanted to stay together (just 13% of Czechs and 18% of Slovaks prefered independence)
The split was decided by the new elected politicians in both republics in 1992 (especially the Czech Václav Klaus and the Slovak Vladimír Mečiar), because the two governments had different visions about their common future
Stary dobry Meciar
Firstly, thanks for your effort oh my god
People like you save the European countries
Secondly, your mom is literally **the** stereotype
xD (no offense please)
And thirdly
I mentioned that 90% of the time the response to where I'm from is "ah, czechoslovakia
" well, 9% of all responses is "yugoslavia" - not even close
It was 27 years ago
That's a long time
No, I just have a more objective view of time
The fact that you were 8 then and you still remember it like it was recently does not mean it's not a long time
There's not just one way to look at it- you can look at it from your perspective, the perspective of the human lifespan and universal events for example
From your perspective, it's not a long time
From the perspective of the human lifespan, it's a more than a third of the time a lot of humans will live
And from the perspective of the universe, it's nothing
Yes, the Kingdom of Hungary, which went through over 20 different monarchs in its history
Not taking off your shoes when you get home or for visit
Definitely the same in many other countries, but it's just infuriating
No one posted here a [Kofola ad
Illegal in some countries, lol, for the better I think
That is pretty cool
It's my favourite too now
Slovakia too
Maybe Germany is just behind, dunno
What if you don't want ice
It gets annoying they put ice into everything
I constantly have to ask them to not
And I ask for tap water all the time here and its not actually that bright, as they make it out to be
They also want to sell you more expensive drinks
I am usually the only one drinking water here anyway from my friends
you can create infinite amounts of swear words by flexing the original ones
for example: "jebať" means fuck you can do "ojebať" which can mean fuck with or scam etc
you can have "dojebať" which means destroy something or do a fuckup and then "najebať" which means to punch or harm someone and this goes for every swear and every preposition or idk how you call the hings you put before or behind a stable word to change its meaning
I used to hate the 3 types of D pronunciation when I studied Danish
I literally don't care, I fuck up my sleep cycle regularly every week, so a one hour difference won't bother me
I see, we are relatives in castles then, we have the most castles per capita
I’m sorry if this is a stupid question, but is Trump going to be the only republican candidate
Because I’ve heard a lot about the democratic ones (Sanders, Warren etc
) but nothing about some other republicans
Three cities would be great: **Vienna - Bratislava - Budapest**. Each city has different vibe, they are all connected also via Danube river, surrounded by fields, hills, forests, vineyards
I've seen pretty much most major cities in Europe, and I too think Istanbul would be awesome for this
Marseilles would be great
However where would they drive
But it would be really cool to see the outskirts of Marseilles vs the small old streets in the city centre
Plus it has great atmosphere
And lof of potential for the gangs
> Paul Ricard
Oh, wow I had not idea that existed
That's why I vastly prefer Bratislava
Granted, there are tourist traps there, but there are few and far between compared to Prague
The city serves primarily its inhabitants, and there's cool food, great stores, fun bars, etc
Prague has some amazing architecture and history, but the city center just feels foreign
Outside of that, really cool city
This will be offensive, and I'm sorry, but Copenhagen felt like a more expensive version of Amsterdam with less charm
I did enjoy the city in its own right, I will absolutely come back
I think the issue is that so many people hyped it and I expected the best place on earth, when in reality it was just a cool city
The main train station is embarrassing though
Terrible signage
My short visit to Tallinn has my dirtiest traveling secret - because of the time constraints, we needed to eat something quick and grabbed a meal McD
That's the moment I became a true American tourist (am from Slovakia but living stateside) and I was so embarrassed, but it gave us another hour of being able to sight see on our own and buy some marzipan, which was mediocre and tourist trappy in its own right
While it’s true that the Trianon treaty fucked Hungary quite badly, Hungarians often seem to forget that they were the oppressors before that
Forced hungarization on other nationalities, banning and punishing people for using their own language, pushing for assimilation and so on
And I say this as a half-hungarian with some very proud Hungarians in my family
(I’m not nationalistic at all, to neither side)
I think everybody here knows [Eurotrip] Another gem is [Hostel] Well that's basically all that has ever been mentioned about Slovakia
Thats a very British looking and sounding Dane
I honestly think it would be a good idea to put up a photo cutout board in the center of Bratislava, with the scenery from the movie, and let tourists take photos (for a nickel)
Eurotrip was not that bad to be honest, but it would have been more accurate if they said it was Košice, cause it doesn't look that different than Luník IX
In The Living Daylights, Pierce Brosnan was chased by Verejná Bezpečnosť, across the field between Bratislava and the Austrian border
Slovak company Feckarse Industries supplied a reading board for an ophtalmologicts office in Father Ted
Not just Americans
Ulrich seidl, our own neighbour, made a film Import Export where he went to Slovakia
Okay he went to lunik 9 and the only title he put in there was Slovakia
Nothing else just Lunik 9 is Slovakia
I still don't understand what was the purpose of that scene any, it kinda didn't fit into narrative
The shithole part was him making fun of that time when some guy on tv called you like that, and the whole Europe came to rescue to tell they are stupid for saying that
They shot the KGB headquarters and berlin kgb headquarters in Slovakia too
So noy sure what was actually Russian there
I always make fun of that
First was used a great place to host anime conventions, I used to live near it and the second one is a radio station
I laughed at the pronounciation
Its sounded as Nikoláž with
Not how I remember latvian language sounding from my friends
Even funnier with new hanna the Amazon prime series
I recognised tje beginning part right away as it set in national park Slovakian paradise on a famous viewpoint basically crawling with people taking photos
And it's on lot of posters
I think they were supposed to be in some Polish wilderness or Black forest or something
Its just so funny to imagine wilderness when I know 20 min walk from there is a cottage are and restaurant
After seeing this, I was like, yep they better go back to Finland
Its funny
The film pitch probably went like this
Executive 1: Oh Danish price married a commoner, let use that
Executive 2: Denmark has a prince
Executive 1: You are right no one knows Denmark has monarchy, lets just make him look british
Executive 2: Ok
how do Danish names sound
Like Richard
Or George
Maybe Edward
Executive 1: Yep Edward seems right
Long time ago, I already concluded green mankini and banks with potassium salt would be a goldmine in the center of Nur-Sultan or Almaty
It's something I'd think to hear from Alex Jones
Heh, this is actually pretty common conspiracy with some differences within countries/ethnicities
E.g. the Slavic version I heard says that pharaohs of ancient Egypt were Slavic
It's supposedly proven by DNA tests done on Tutankhamun's mummy
The truth is obviously kept secret by the NWO folks so they can enslave the Slavic people
And even better, I recently heard Chinese version of that (and I actually got a link to Taiwanese article laughing about it):
Also if you meet your cousin once again, send him my warmest greetings and tell him we will make sure to get our lowlands back to reunite Great Slovakia once again (/s)
Oh, jokes, yes, exactly, jokes are what that is
Czech prime minister is actually slovak, funny joke right
Nothing else to see here
Yeah I enjoyed times between wars better, than pre1914
National uprising bros, again
Ha, you wish
What are your offering in exchange
Nie ďakujeme, my ich už máme dostatok
We already do
Think of it as a dinner included
Everytime i go to California Pizza Kitchen i barely eat half, but yaay can take it home and don't have to deal with dinner
Americans are definitely more expressive
Its very easy to pick you up in a crowd too
From the clothes too, but also the way you talk or express yourself
Also so true about being talkative
But also very nice
And yep we do get freaked by your servers
Its just seemed fake
Like all they want is your money
Its a huge contrast, especially if you are used to barely see your server in most of the Europe
Thats the big difference
In here we want them to keep away and keep the distance, in Usa you want them close, because you are used to it
We have 5 days for visiting doctor and 5 day for going to doc with your relatives, mandatory
This is just standart treatment, like dentist
For Slovakia it would be some mining town probably
Kremnica (with the old Hungarian minting press museum) or Banska Stiavnica
Also, If a foreigner wants to experience a bit of cultural mix, he/she could visit western/southern Slovakia
Either Zahorie (mix of czech and slovak culture) or anything under Bratislava (mix of slovak and hungarian)
There's also the whole Burgenland region and Niederosterreich with the vineyards and cute little villages
Hainburg an der Donau is also remarkable because of its city walls and castle
Likewise, the Neusieedler See can provide a great summer holiday for someone, who might think that Balaton is just too overcrowded
Fagot
It means bassoon
Then there is šukať and szukat (Polish)
Both pronounced pretty much the same
In Slovak it means "to fuck" in Polish it means "to search".
Also a bit more innocent one for people who think Slovak and Czech are almost identical
There is a word "kapusta". In Slovak it's cabbage
In Czech it's kale
Another is the word kočka
In Czech it's a cat
In Slovak it's a beautiful girl
I'm sure there's more words like that tho
The word "Gift".
In English it means a present, in German a poison
Otrok in Slovakia means child but in Serbia it means slave, nust be coincidence
In Slovak it means both, cat and crampon
I always thought it's because it resembles cat's claws
Not really, but we do share a lot of news stories and TV programmes with Czechia, not mentioning movie or TV show's Czech dub, since our languages are so intelligible
It's not overwhelming, since our media prefers to cover domestic problems
It is just nice
For minorities like Hungarians, a lot watch Hungarian TV and read Hungarian media instead of Slovak, which creates this sort of feeling of detachment for some
Like my grandma, she watches Hungarian news/TV and reads papers in it
And it's obvious how certain programmes or papers influence her opinion negatively
I once saw a huge governmental ad in one criticizing Brussels and Juncker, and she took it as a fact that the EU is trying to rule us without our input
It's better when they prefer Slovak media, since it's less biased (less than in Hungary), but since people don't speak Slovak well, they rather prefer Hungarian stuff
Depends on the person
A lot of Hungarians here watch and read Hungarian media, but those interested in domestic issues will certainly prefer Slovak media
In our family it's kind of all over the place
When growing up, I mostly watched Hungarian TV, but now I prefer Slovak channels (since our news are let's say
not censored)
But when talking to my grandparents, who prefer Hungarian channels, I can see how it influences them (they say we need a strong ruler like Orban or Putin, migrants are a plague etc
), and even after explaining why they're wrong, they still maintain their old ways
A man can do only so much
Yeah, and I was apparently brainwashed by leftist media and my university
Fun times
I hate overpopulated places, so definitely not the low countries
Weather wise, I hate when it's unbearably hot in the summer, but I also hate it when it's rainy and slushy in the winter
Looking at the map, I would probably love southern Sweden, possibly Gothenburg or Malmo - but I've never been to these places, so there might be things that would put me off that I don't know off
And what’s stopping you
I heard you can communicate pretty well together
Norway is beautiful country and so is Denmark
I hitchhiked from Slovakia all the way to Kristiansand and spend there 1 week in tent in luxury part of town on beach  met a lot of friendly people definitely want to come back
however may I ask you, you surely understand more, what’s the difference between Denmark and Norway
I mean what are the reasons you’d like to immigrate to a dennmark when it’s similar country (at least from my POV)
Reverse one
Couple years back in Istanbul I met a girl who was born and raised in US of A and when she heard me saying that I'm from Slovakia she just happily exclaimed how she is Slovak too given her mother is from Slovakia and father from Czechia
I just thought to myself that its another american who 'really' is European and I just said to her in Slovak "great, so you understand this". She just smiled and replied with distinct Bratislava accent "yeah and couple things more
Turns out she spent all summers until 18 at her grandmother house near Bratislava and learned fluent Slovak
slovak here, we call them farár (priest) or faraón (pharaoh) cards
5°? Depends what "good jacket" is, also depends on the wind and rain/snow
It can be - 10° snowy and no wind so still pretty "hot". And it can be 10° windy AF with cold rain
Weather is not as simple as temperature scale
I dont
I suffer greatly during winter, i really hate that
Now i started to take vitamin D and i feel better, but still hate it
But this year was very warm, probably the best winter of my life in that regard
I kinda look forward to longer nights, actually
The nighttime is pretty kino
[Tell me it ain't.]
We ski
There is a love for skiing here
Ao much that some of us get really sad when the winter is over
Also holidays season and comfort food and cakes
Sometimes I just voted for the lesser evil but there were times when I really believed in a party, even if they maybe didn’t win
But tbh I don’t think that there’s ever been a party that I would 100% agree with on everything
Hard to say if it is declining or increasing
But now it is around 30%.
How about a working with refugees and immigration
Did you have any luck there
I had a social worker friend who did this, especially working with the newcommers and especially helping those with not so nice and pretty sad stories
Or were they requiring the languages
Ok she was from Belgium, but I thought maybe Netherlands can be similar
Oh damn
I am sorry
Yeah I guess they only can pay for some depending on money allocation
But it sucks they wotn pay you for all the work
And I agree so competitive
However, awesome job you are doing, that is definitely not easy to work in this field
Good luck in your job search
I will be the other way soon (moving to us) well if I manage to travel
And I am scared about jobs too
When someone says that we are upper Hungary
If you say that in front of slovaks, be prepared to be burned at stake
When foreigners think we are still Czechoslovakia or we speak Russian
And when somebody thinks Slovakia is same as Slovenia
(or when our Czech bros calling us Hungarians
we feel you
now why overcomplicate it, we'd be Slovenkia and the only thing standing in the way of this happening is Austria tbh, but we're willing to embrace them and their developed infrastructure
you know you officially renamed yourselves to Czechia couple years back, right
I'm still not used to it
Interesting thing is that Netherlands in slovak language is "Holandsko".
the feelings may not be mutual atm
World’s highest number of castles and chateaux per capita, appearantly
~~(**Slovakia** - how do I get flair
)~~
> Just imagine an incredible number of 180 castles and 425 chateaux in a country with the entire population far smaller than the city of New York
I see this as a positive thing tho
Most of the world wasn't properly prepared
And while many other countries simply say that protective equipment should be used by sick people only (since they don't have enough of them to be used by everyone), people in Czechia and Slovakia simply craft them themselves
This is actually something people abroad should take as an example
I agree that this crisis shown how unprepared nations across the globe are
This is not only Czechia
This is almost every country
Simply because it's first time we experience this
Last huge pandemic hitting Europe was Spanish flu hundred years ago
I'm pretty sure we will be way better prepared for the next one
Take Taiwan as an example
They were hit extremely hard with SARS outbreak few years ago
They were also unprepared back than
But today they are the nation which is handling this pandemic the best
So in this perspective I'm quite positive about this
It shows that our people are eager to fight together
That's always a good thing
Regarding war - that's where NATO and collective defenses should come in
Ehm what
Various studies show that it helps decreasing the spread of this type of illnesses
Just search for studies focusing on community spread rather than individual protection
Face mask isn't meant to protect you, it's meant to protect others
Again, ehm what
Even that article claims it's better than nothing
I definitely saw more boobs 10-15 years ago, although that's probably because I was in my early 20s, while now I am just married
Omg indeed
I never really realized how expensive Lego was for people with average wages
My brother used to have hundreds of sets, I never looked at prices since I was a kid back then too
I definitely think it should be cheaper
*equivocation*
That's not very Anglish ;D More like Italian
English without the Latin words is much better
The Latin words feel foreign
It's a shame that you thrown out many of your own words and use Latin based words instead
Words like *equivocation* sound off in English
In everyday life nobody is using words like 'equivocal'. In daily life the 'for hundred' thing is less than 80
In Slovakia during march, we are burning and drowning [Morena] , pagan goddes of  winter and death
Its symbol of ending winter and new life
Also during Spring there are other fests as [Fašiangy] for instance where are people dresing in various costumes and other fun stuff
r/JuropijanSpeling a bit
Mussolini was just desperatly trying not to look like a bitch in front of hitler lol
There's a guy on youtube, can't link on mobile
Historia Civilis is the channel name and he has a video about "Constitution of Sparta". It's really great despite the boring name
I don't have any sources, but my friend is a historian and last time I asked him he said it went something like this:
Basically there was a huge expulsion after WW1, especially in Bratislava and the west, mostly of Germans and Hungarians
This was however limited to Bratislava itself since the people in charge wanted to make it a capital (before that, Pressburg was about 40% German speaking, 30% Hungarian speaking and the rest Czech/Slovak)
So after Bratislava was "ethnically cleansed" (expulsion kind not murder kind) there was an agreement with Hungary to swap people
But there were more Hungarians in southern Slovakia than Slovaks (and still are to this day) so the rest could stay
During WW2 the south was occupied by Hungary and a lot of people from Hungary moved in, since they thought it's gonna be Hungarian now (which was guaranteed by Hitler at the time)
So now we have almost no Slovaks in Hungary and "exchanged Hungarians" back in South Slovakia and then some
After WW2 there was a resettlement of the "additional" people that came in, but the situation got complicated and after an agreement with Hungary, they were allowed to stay
Interesting is the ratio of Slovaks-to-Hungarians in Dunajská Streda, a city in "the south" that is however close to Bratislava and quite representative of the whole area
In 1914 it was like 70H-10S,the rest Czech and German
1935 would be about 60H-40S
1942 90H-10S
1948 still about 85-15
2019 about 50-50 because of people from Bratislava moving in and a lot of young people blurring the line between ethnicities, speaking both languages
Hungarians weren't on the same level as Germans, but yes, it is sad that some fuck can't accept that we did some bad shit too
On the other hand, nearly 20% of the population is proud of the puppet Slovak state and it's actions, so I'm not that suprised about their ignorance towards Hungarians
>...Slovak government basically ignores this and it’s not even taught in history classes
Considering we barelly touched WW2, I'm happy some kids heard about the Holocaust at least
Does any language have a specific word for that dull feeling people get on Sunday evening, thinking about going to work/school the next morning, realizing it's still their leisure time, but it's too late to travel anywhere, start working on a major thing around the household or, foremost, get drunk
I swear I had gut feeling Swedish would be the language
Odkedy v Poľsku voláte nedeľu piatok
What would be the term when you are actually unemployed, you know that the only thing that can happen to you on Monday is that an HR person will call you to schedule a job interview, and you feel like getting drunk, but you've been drinking the previous three evenings and you know you should take a break at least from time to time
That isn't even pseudo-Czech, that's just normal Czech with one little typo
We use this term in Colorado
Correctly in Czech it is "Neděle večer a humor por*ou*chaný"
In Slovak "Nedeľa večer a humor pokazený"
Strangely, Slovak does have the noun "porucha" which means outage just like in Czech, but there is no such adjective as "porúchaný" in use in common speech, although it would be generally comprehensible and even feel Slovak, indeed
We beat women with a stick made out of willow branches and throw bucket of cold water on them during Easter Monday and then we get chocolate eggs and money in return
Logic
Also known as Morena/Morana in other countries, she's kind off like a slavic goddes of death
Where I come from she's ussually burned and thrown to river, which means the winter has ended, the time has come for spring and the renewal of life
this is amazing
In Slovakia we do it everywhere
We also call it “Morena”
A Slovak that doesn't complain about everything (even made up things)
Or a Czech who doesn’t say "ty vole" in every other sentence
How dare you
In Slovak:
Slnko = Sun (neutral)
Mesiac = Moon (masculine)
hviezda = star (feminine)
I think it depends on the ending of the word: words ending with -a are usually feminine, with -o are usually neutral and with a consonant are usually masculine
The Moon is usually depicted as male (but in arts, the Moon is called also Luna, feminine) and the stars are usually depicted as girls
The Sun is neutral, non-specific (like [this] but it can be depicted as male ([this] or female ([this] Or they all can be anything ([this] I feel like there is not just one option
But the neutral is not really a problem, because, for example, the word "girl" (dievča) or "baby" (dieťa) is gramatically neutral too
Slovak: To slnko (it - middle gender) Ten Mesiac (he - male gender)
In Slovak, the Sun - to Slnko (neutral), the Moon - ten Mesiac (masculine) and the Earth is - tá Zem (feminine)
English does use gender for some inanimate objects but in an associative way, even for some abstract concepts
The things that are associated with harsh or extreme features have the masculine associated (Sun, death, Summer, Winter) while things with moderate or pleasant features have the feminine assocated (Moon, Spring, Autumn, mercy)
There are other examples like political units or nations having feminine associated while plain geographical locations are neuter (might have mixed up those in a way, though)
I agree with that, definitely
Weed needs a certain temperature to make someone or smething high, so unfortunately they were not high
>Suspect: Yes yes yeahhhhhhh
I read this shit in Salamanderman's voice
[This glorious filth]
Depends on your job I feel like but I think German, French, Russian and Spanish could be useful
It is the shit
I am totally playing it to my kid one day
With pingu and moomins and tin tin
If I ever have a kid
My mom used to do the same thing
She left me sleep on balcony in cold
Apparently i slept very well
Better than usual
Unfortunately I lost my cold resistance after I discovered hot showers and local hot springs
Do I really see a hyphen
Did we just won the [Hyphen war]
Its something you romance languages can't appreciate
On the other hand, I often have problems pronouncing french words because I just get lost in all those vowels
Dude everyone has breweries now
My hometown of 27 thousands has like 4 around
We are talking about mainstream and mass produced beer
Not about breweries
We know local ones are good
Craft thing is absolutely a thing everywhere in the world
I love how languages works as this
I love the sound of romance languages as french, spanish or romanian because it sounds softer more melodic to me
Actually we use r as some kind of a vowel
Also the reason why it is so prevalent in those words
Yes this, thank you
And thats the fact I learned on reddit, because obviously I was not paying attention in school
Maybe Jozef Tiso, he was the Slovak president during WW2, basically the Slovak Führer, however, he is very controversial from both sides
He wasn't a nazi in conviction, he wasn't as radical as other people in the gover ment at that time (like Vojtech Tuka) and probably allowed attrocities so he doesn't get replaced for someone much more radical who would go out of their way to commit attrocities, as opposed to the "required" ones (we were forces to be a German ally at that time)
Therefore I'd suggest to paint his as neither a hero nor a genocidal maniac
Probably Jozef Tiso, president during WW2 that is responsible for sending thousands of Jews and others to Hitler
He was basically Hitler's bitch
But many people see him also as a national hero, just because he managed to keep Slovakia's existence as a German puppet state and we were "prosperous".
In our country is probably Jozef Tiso (presidend of Slovak State during WW2) or Vladimir Mečiar (First prime mimister of Slovakia)
The old witch is dead
The only people that i know and learned my native language(slovak) and speak it without the accent are from other slavic nations (for example Polish) but still you can hear it maybe not from the accent but from the choice of words
One Indian chef that moved to Slovakia speaks very good Slovak though and I would not know he is not Slovak because he makes no mistakes and his accent is pretty decent
As there are many Hungarians living in Slovakia, hungarian accent is pretty common in Tv (actors with hungarian ancestry) and even though they live in Slovakia their whole life sometimes they struggle to not to have proper accent and, exactly, mostly because the vowels are different in Hungarian
But nobody really cares because its very common
Even though i can say only few words in hungarian, i am definitely goulash-gobbling lángos-loving paprikaphile
Hungarian cuisine is one of the best
I read that Basque is one of the most difficult languages to learn and to be at native's level
Are there many people who learn it
Yes, also most of the Slovaks have their accent in czech even though they live there for many years and were exposed to language since childhood
I met maybe 2 or 3 people who I could not tell they were Slovaks
Its always about the same words we share, then they always switch to a slovak pronunciation
Best example is your PM
Thank you Czechia  for being a big brother to us, and also for your delicious beer (best in the world)
Poland for saving us from Ottomans in battle of  Wien
Thanks Slovenia for sending us mail each year that was wrongly sent to you, instead of us
I second this, thank you
Thanks Czechia for your amazing beer and humour ️
Nothing changed since 1700, still not interesting enough for average european
I’d remarry you any time
Didnt the revolution cause the split of austria into austria-hungary
I always thought the revolution was a success for the hungarians (as we slovaks sided with austrians and were promised recognition and got nothing) but i guess if it really was a succes hungary would be completely independent
Well, being incapable of properly representing and recognizing its vast minorities was the downfall of austria hungary and by start of ww1 it was already too late
Czech and Slovak are so similar we understand each other
Polish is more distant for us but there are some words we can comprehend and put into a meaning
I can understand Czechs fluently and vise versa
With some effort I can also understand Polish
Yeah, Polish would be better understood by Slovaks, especially those familiar with eastern-slovak dialect
That being said, Slovaks and Czechs can easily understand each other, I dare to say our understaning is the best between all Slavic languages
Our languages are very similar + we are highly exposed to one another so there barely any problems with conversation
But speaking of one Czechoslovak would not be possible
Maybe some centuries earlier yes, but now  we're too different for it to be just "dialects".
What are the differences between them
As a Slovak, I can't imagine 2 languages being even closer without being just dialects of one language
But then again, I know virtually nothing of the Balkan area
I think there was an immigration of Croats into Slovakia in the former Kingdom of Hungary
We have many people whose last names are “Horváth” and a village called like Chorvátsky Grob
Therefore I think this could be a reason why we understand each other a little better
That's cheating then, innit mate
Just kidding
That's interesting, I didn't know that, thanks for enlightening me
News channel has 30 minutes segments
Or if that the US news are maybe 2-3 minutes (riots, disasters, Trump making idiot of himself and so on)
If something serious with worldwide impact happened it can be more
weekly news mostly "orange man did bad thing" or "someone died because of guns"
I have learnt so much here
Like seriously
Those small things you had no idea that existed, will be mentioned and you are like oh Finns do that, I had no idea
Also people are funny here
Yes
I’ve met people from several other continents and the cultural shock that I’ve experienced compared to the one that I’ve had with people from other parts of Europe was tremendous
You might say that western and Eastern Europe have different traditions and ideas but we’re fundamentally the same deep down, as there’s not that many things that we differ in
It’s just two sides of the same coin while with the rest of the world it would be two entirely different coins
It’s only nationalism that drives a deep divide between us in my opinion
Without it we’d be much closer and I think that the EU is sort of bridging that gap
I am proud that I was born in Europe and can call myself European Citizen
Unfortunately, I am not proud about my Slovak Nationality
I think there’s strength in numbers and that cultures aren’t associated with language or country
I definitely identify more as European than as a Slovak
I can see huge culture differences between far-away places in any country and vague culture similarities between nearby countries
Same thing goes with dialects
Western Slovak is much more close to Moravian dialects than to Eastern Slovak ones
I would love to see European Union truly united and separated into truly culturally-based subregions which would have equal footing
Yes I believe that you can relate more to European people and customs than outside people and stuff
However, do I believe that there should be only European identity
Hell NO
I’m proud of my country and I won’t denounce my heritage
Can you describe it
Most of these sound as expected
> Way bigger divide between men and women(feeling only really but as a 20 year old guy the entire thing was kind of creepy on more than one occasion
Some things American women seemed to be ok with that would just not fly over here)
Like what
Bratislava
Well thats probably the only place people go into
I personally like Bratislava, but I can see how it may be boring to people
Its definitely small
I lived there so I know the good spots but its not like the tourists will find those
The true fun is outside
Freaking lot of castles, lot of parks, old towns and some mountains
We dont really get much tourists unless its our neighbours
Czechs know better where to go anyway
But some still should wear better shoes to Tatras
My most favourite moments is when Czech, Slovak and Pole sit behind the same table in one of Tatra cottages, drinking beer after a hike
And there seem to be some occasional lost German there
Generally people seem to bypass us constantly while doing their eastern europe trips, so it actually gets suprising when you meet someone who isn't czech, polish or Hungarian or  Ukrainian
Shoot out to Romanians, I have met some
But we definitely could do with less stag parties in Bratislava
It's such a terrible place
In the morning it smells of piss and vomit
Full of young Brits making a mess, trash everywhere
at least the beach looks good
Although I've heard that a lot depends on where you're residing (hotel or resort)
I never want to visit that place again
The only thing, which sort of saved it was Nesebar, that town is just beautiful
Because Croats are very friendly and helpful people
Plus we Slovaks like to go there, because Croatia is culturally and aesthetic wise similar to Slovakia
Except you have a sea too
Which is a huge bonus
I just love your people
The best thing after a long day is to sit down with the appartment owners, chat and have some rakija
Same
I've heard so many good things about it, and I desperately wanted to visit it
When I got a chance (in the off season) due to work, I went there
The old town is just amazing
I loved it
The bridge, the castle and the squares
simply beautiful
The rest though
Bratislava 2
I don't mean to be rude, but the rest is grey, colorless, socialist looking city, with a lot of sketchy areas (similar to those in Bratislava)
Since I understand Czech I was able to find some very cheap places to eat at and visit, but other than that it wasn't pretty
And what the hell is up with all those sellers and homeless people on the sidewalks
Seemed very weird
Brno remains my favorite Czech city
I am glad you liked it
And it probably was kc dunaj
Its one of my favourite clubs too
They do great events
Is it
I thought it was totally crowded lately
Last year Strbske Pleso was so crowded
But maybe because there is other hiking spots
There is low tatras, then Slovenský raj, Karpaty, mala fatra velka Fatra
Lots of hiking spots, so maybe people who get bored of Tatras go there
It really is
And it's such a shame too
You may have been lucky
But most of the popular spots get crowded, but when you leave the easier tourists trails, it can get quite deserted
But I haven't been to polish side in years, gotta change it soon
Thats actually a great idea
I mean, we planned to go hiking to Italy this year, but you know, and this seems like a great alternative
Hmm, i must have been sleeping to hard, i didnt felt it
For me it was totally LA and Vegas
Huge disappointment
LA was dirty and full of homelesness and so much traffic with really bad public transport
The people and how they dress too
Its all very superficial
And the walk of fame, just a dirty street full of people stuffing you with their rapper CD or people selling tours to see stars houses
However the other parts of it as Santa Monica and Long Beach are nice
However I got recommended some museums, so will check them later
Vegas also, is not for me
Strip is just full of people and lots of gambling
Could not afford the shows, but maybe some other time
The moment you leave the strip so many weirdos on street
Lot of super expensive parties and people basically glued to each other in pools
Not my thing at all
But well was supposed to be at EDC now, so thats a bummer, because that looks awesome
The best appeal of Vegas for me its the location to national parks
Those are the true wonder
Not far to Zion, red rock Canyon and tge Grand canyon
Also Dubai went past me
It fels like a fake city
I guess if you love malls and really expensive alcohol
Also not a big fan of sunny beach in Bulgaria
Especially as there are much better places there
Just these resorts are meh
Agreed
Totally visit Jordan
One of the most beautiful places I ever been to
Wadi rum is like another world
Also heard great things about Oman
Lots of female travellers got there alone and loved it
Also Lebanon
Do you have any recommendations
Some maybe more artsy places, or something like that
And I totally agree on food
Love the food
However the traffic, nope cant get used to it
There were a 5 lines in one direction and they were all full
I am sorry for all the drunk and noisy tourists you guys get there
It totally is
Its the successful parts and the failed parts in one
Holywood . That's pretty much it
Its has the fame aspect, its the biz
I don't get it either, especially if two hours away there is San Diego with much better everything
Beautiful beaches, great people and the Old Town and one dollar tortillas
German: Kurve (curve)
Slavic languages: Kurva (bitch)
We have legendary polish words
Szukat their looking for means to fuck in Slovakia and Czech Republic
Also found out zachod which means toilet here its a west in polish
It was very confusing map for me at the beginning
Also bojsko, means a playground in Polish, here it means warzone
Was confused when a kid asked where it is
I was like wtf you want to do
Slovak - Russian
Zápach (bad smell) and Vôňa (good smell) have opposite meanings
Späť means backwards in Slovak
"Krásny život" in slovak means "beautiful life"
"krasnyj život" in russian means "red belly"
I don’t wanna sound like a whining baby but I really don’t like living in Slovakia
Personally, I actually didn’t click with the culture, traditions, people as well as the system
Other than that Slovakia is seriously backwards in almost everything
Almost nothing works properly
The school and healthcare system are not the worst, but far from ideal
Salaries are quite low for ordinary people
There is quite a high rate of qualified slovaks each year who decide to move out because they hate the system
TL:DR: Slovakia - Not the worst, far from the ideal
I really like living here
I once wanted to move so badly when I was younger because I though it's shit here, but almost every country has it's annoying flaws
I am quite fine with where I am and even the political climate is getting actually better
As for Slovakia, we are alright i guess
We are landlocked, which is unfortunate, tho in the past as part of the Kingdom of Hungary, perhaps the Habsburg Monarchy as well, we had an access to sea
Not too many slovaks could use it though
For our neighbours: the Czechs are good
The Hungarians, well a teeny bit too nationalistic, but I personally prefer the old borders, so I dont mind
The Poles, I dont know much about really
We share the Tatra Mountains (tho we have the bigger part, alright)
More slovaks from Orava could say more about the poles I guess
For Austria
Yeah, we go to work and shop there
They have got better salaries and prices, and better quality of products sold
For example even tho I am all the way from Trenčín, I sometimes find myself shop there
And Ukraine
That I dont know anything about, other than that they sometimes illegaly try to get cigarettes trough the border
Our landscapes are of 2 types- the Mountains and the Lowlands (I dont know the english word)
The Lowlands are in the southwest, and other than that mixed between some mountain ranges
Then the mountains are everywhere else really, if we dont take the other smaller lowlands
The Carphatian mountains are really big force in here
The weather is pretty normal for Central Europe (-10 to 5 degrees during the Winter, 25 to 35 during summer)
Rains are more rare than sunny day or cloudy ones, but we dont have any problems with that
I would say something about industry too, but I now absolutely forgot everything, for some reason
But I know our 2 main companies in industry sector are Slovnaft in Bratislava (Slovak fuel refinery) and USS in Košice (United States Steel- The name speaks for itself pretty much)
Pretty much the same over here, if only there was another slovakia with a sea bordering austria and hungary
The funniest I heard was to call a press conference, as press conference in Slovak is tlačovka and pushing  is tlačiť and press is tlač
They used to be extremely popular, together with Skoda 120
Even during the 90s and early 2000s the Ladas had a reputation of being easy to repair and maintain, which was a godsend to poorer families
We had one
If you took care of it, that car could put the newer one's to shame
But of course in the long term' they all rusted and broke down:/
No joke, my dad's old firm used Lada Nivas to rescue stuck off road cars in the forests and mountains
That car is surprisingly sturdy
I think the 2009 cash for clunkers policy in Slovakia made it dissappear, finally
I remember a bunch of 80s and 90s cars on the roads in the mid 2000s, those are mostly all gone
Seeing a Škoda Felicia is a rare thing, even in the poorer parts of Slovakia
Let alone a Lada
Not in person, but for all the people wo put ketchup on langos please stop
He can still drink a kofola
The Slovaks love it
Most of the slovaks
I think he meant kofola
Same in Slovakia, we use "svetlé pivo" (light beer) for beers of yellow-ish colour
Oh I perfectly fit into mine
I just feel like everyone else does not
Well we drink on every occasion possible, birthday, holiday, wedding, funeral, family meeting, friends meeting, meeting new people, celebrating Friday, being in bad mood, being in good mood, just to get drunk, getting a new job, loosing a job, getting a paycheck, drinking with last money etc
I mean what do you expect from former CCCP countries  usually if you don’t drink you are the weird one here
When you drink, its because you are thirsty, either for sustenance or for experiences
In Eastern Europe, you see a lot of them
Pictures of Jesus, church promotions
Its everywhere
How I envy you
Some examples:
It's usually in rural areas (which to be fair are very common since half of our population lives outside of cities and the number keeps increasing)
But yeah, a prety sizeable part takes religion seriously here
Billboards are mostly stuff like God wants to help you, Let God enter your life, Jesus is here for you and so on
But there are also some more "aggresive" or "in your face" ones, such as this one:
[But whoever denies me before men, I also will deny before my Father who is in heaven] - for context, we've had our national population survey during the last months and this is a response to a movement against proclaiming yourself catholic if you don't even go to church so as not to support the Church neither financially nor with soft power to support policies such as antiabortion or anti free speech laws
When there is a billboard in a city, it often ends up like this:
[- Why did you abandon me
- Because you don't exist
Unfortunately, religion is still big in rural areas and some politicians are elected only because their voters are super religious - thats why they push this agenda everywhere
I hope with the recent population survey the number of believers will drop,.
Definitely Polish
But I think we can read and understand like 30% of Serbo-Croatian
Czech
That of course, because we used to be a part of the same country and we (at least in Slovakia) still watch a lot of movies/TV shows and whatnot in Czech if Slovak dub/sub isn't available
Polish is also kinda understandable if spoken slowly(haha) or written, and maybe Bulgarian, but for example russian is way too different for me, I legit wouldn't catch anything at all unless the person really went out of their way to be clear and slow D;
i understand czech and polish, if i knew cyrilic alphabet i would maybe figure out something also from other slavic languages, and personally i understand bit of spanish because i used to watch tons of football in it and i can guess many things thanks to context and assimilation with other languages, but i never actually learnt it
I can undersand russian even tho my only experience with it was learning cyrilics which wasn´t that hard I can´t understand people when they speak (except for some random words) but when I see something written in russian I can understand it 90% of the times
>and maybe Bulgarian
I highly doubt so :) I had Bulgarian colleague and I hardly understood a word
Been to Bulgaria every summer since I was like 7, so maybe that's why, but I'm pretty sure I could get by somehow :D
You're right though, it is a quite different language D;
Teaching young boys to ceremoniously whip women and splash water at them every easter
You usually phase out of it as an adult man nowadays, thinking how horrible it is, yet you refuse to not pass on the experience to the kids
Well i would say pirohy or šišky
¹ pirohy -> they are made in most cases from potato dough,  filling depends on region (it can be jam , cottage cheese or sort of things like meat , vegetables , blue cheese etc
² šišky -> these are made from sourdough
Again , filling depends on region
It can be filled with jam , raw vegetables / fruit, chocolate,  various creams etc
Párek v rohlíku
Just a wiener in rohlík.
Fries, langos, placky (grated potato pancakes) laska (potato pancakes ) and cigánská oecienka (it's not racist and it is just a chicken or pig meat between a bun like bread ish thing, but a lot harder and also onions and mustard )
Slovakia
I think langoš is more applicable (even if it's a hungarian invention)
Yeah, langoš with tartar sauce/sour cream, garlic and grated cheese is perfect
I take it , but imo , fast food is most likely fried on pan or in a deep frier , so , that's why
I would say it's [tank man from 1968]
Came here to post this
Definitely the first photo that comes to most Slovaks' minds when it comes to historical photos
The man was later identified to be Emil Gallo
He took his life 2 years later due to family reasons (years after occupation were turbulent for many families)
His daughter said that she found out about this the next day when the photo of her father was published
He never really talked about it with them tho
However, a 17 years old girl was killed by soviet occupants at those places
Regarding photographer Ladislav Bielik - the world didn't really know who made the picture as it was distributed anonymously
However, the regime knew
He was forced to leave his job and he was assigned work in less prestigious positions during normalization which followed after the soviet occupation of Czechoslovakia
He died in 1984
He was finally internationally recognized as the author of the picture after the fall of communist regime
More on the story in [this article]
Absurd bitching about everything that exists/existed, happened, didnt happen, is supose to happen, or is not supose to happen
Homophobia (pretending to be straight is *fun*...) and significantly lower quality of distance education compared to regular education along with lack of helpful info and communication when it comes to applying to universities
Basically same here 20 € for 4 GB, but considering our wages, it's even worst probably
Even if anything is good, many people bitch about it not happening sooner
We are World Champions in complaining and cynicism
Just wait until you actually are in University
Does not get much better
You could get 4ka, which has unlimited data and calls for 20 euros
though the reception isn't as good as the big threes
I certainly don't doubt that lol, but some of the stuff I had to call them for could have been easily posted on their website
But hey, if they want plenty of confused students to call them with the same questions all day, who am I to judge ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Ugh, do you mean Slovenia
We haven't been in Eurovision since 2012
Not exactly what you asked because it relates to currency, but Czech students often measure their expenses in beers
In Prague a beer is usually 30-40 czk (1
1-1
4€), so a mcdonald menu costs 3 beers, new (cheap) shoes 15-20 beers and so on
In Slovakia we have pokokot and it means from here to that cunt over there
Also it can mean that you have a lot of work (mam pokokot roboty)
Or there were many people ( bolo tam pokokot ľudí )
Outside of the amount of election periods to finish the highway from Bratislava to Košice, I can't think of any
Joo, vittukitaristi purilainen
Same in Slovakia
"Mail" in spoken language may be used more than "e-mail", but still, we don't say "gmail", just when we really mean Gmail
You just need to study Austrian Hungarian empire
But more like
Czech Republic
Hungary
Russia
Germany
Austria
Czechia - We shared most of our history together, like we were one state longer than we were sepparated, and lived thru most of the both wars together
Hungary - the uter hatred towards hungary is felt thru all of our history books, and our constitution
Russia - well iron curtain happened, we were there
Germany - nazi puppet state duh
Somebody put ottoman empire down in comments, so I might put Samo's Empire here, we are pretty proud about that thingy, whilst it lasted
Edit: actually samos empire would be above germany and russia, wery proud about that
whilst it lasted
> We shared most of our history together, like we were one state longer than we were sepparated
I mean we together for a longer time in one entity even with Croatia than Czech lands
> the uter hatred towards hungary is felt thru all of our history books
like current history school books
well, not really
> our constitution
wtf where
> samos empire would be above germany and russia, wery proud about that
whilst it lasted
sorry, but again wtf
regarding early Slavic states there definitely is an obsession with Great Moravia but this alleged pride about Samo's Empire is quite a stretch
No we don't.
It was years ago, so I don’t really know, but from what I remember it was mostly about the territory of Slovakia plus events that affected us significantly like Mohács, Turkish wars, etc
and later we’ve talked about Magyarization and Černová massacre and WW1
We learn mostly about the history in the North, but also about the events affecting whole country (like kings, their policies etc)
So in practice we learn about the Golden Bull, the Battle of Mohács, but then there's focus only on the Turkish wars taking place in the North; we learn about the division of the kingdom, the uprisings, but then it's focused mostly on Royal Hungary
In the 19th century it's mainly about the conflict of Hungarian and Slovak national movements
Also most of the maps presented show only the North with the current borders of Slovakia marked as well, which can be maybe controversial for Hungarians
Like I dunno much about current, I never felt like any books I got in school were very current, and yeah our constitution was pretty much sentence after sentence, first declaring our independence and after that declaring that no other nation can rule over us mainly hungarians, or something like that
I dunno I read it on the internet now, it doesnt look like something I read years ago, since that was even written in older language
I went to school few years ago, might be more PC now, but I remember how hated the hungarians were portrayed in there, like satan himself is down under those boarders
Also yeah Samo´s empire is (was) mentioned more, also I seen it mentioned few times on here to be convinced that Slovak people care about it more than GM, but yeah GM is pretty big talk in our history too
"I mean we together for a longer time in one entity even with Croatia than Czech lands "  - I have no idea what that sentence is suposed to mean
> I went to school few years ago, might be more PC now, but I remember how hated the hungarians were portrayed in there, like satan himself is down under those boarders
It seems your memories about the portrayal of Hungary in the school books mixed with other sources, maybe teachers, politicians, other people
I remember (and looked them up now) the books from the early 2000s and I can't find anything similar to what you're stating
I think it would be fair to acknowledge that the anti-Hungarian sentiment in the 90s and the 00s didn't have much to do with the books and the constitution, unless you can explicitly show the examples
> I dunno I read it on the internet now, it doesnt look like something I read years ago, since that was even written in older language
The part you're referring to hasn't changed since 1992 so it could hardly be written in "older language". I still can't find any "utter hate" or mentions of Hungarians
> Also yeah Samo´s empire is (was) mentioned more, also I seen it mentioned few times on here to be convinced that Slovak people care about it more than GM
That's very subjective but ok
> "I mean we together for a longer time in one entity even with Croatia than Czech lands " - I have no idea what that sentence is suposed to mean
I have a typo there, \*we were together
Even if you count the pre-1918 history in the Habsburg Empire (even though there were different policies in the parts we and the Czechs belonged to), 10th century - 16th century of separation is still longer than 16th century - 1993
In addition to that, what is "sharing history" in the early Middle Ages with Czechs is a bit complicated subject
The point I wanted to make is that the "common" history of Slovaks and Czech isn't exceptionally long, considering that we shared longer history with all the nations of Hungarian Kingdom (like Croats) than with Czechs
That doesn't negate all the mutual contacts we've had throughout the history
You cannot rly compare history with czech to that with hungarians, yeah we probably were on par with everybody at some point in time, but the last 150years of empire (maybe more hard to evaluate) we were basicaly slaves in "our" empire
But yeah, maybe hungary is above czechia in the matter of ammount of facts learned in history classes, not against that idea
Also how is my sentence about Samo subjective but yours about Moravia isnt
Aand yeah ... I dont think why else would a kid at elementary school have anti-hungarian ideas other than what is teached, maybe teachers portrayed it in very bad way during lessons about Empire
Dunno but Im preety sure we were portrayed as opressed minority in the books
I mean yeah they dont write in book that HATE HUNGARY/HUNGARY BAD, obviously
> You cannot rly compare history with czech to that with hungarians
The OP's question was: "If someone were to study your whole country's history, about which other 5 countries would they learn the most
", not something like "Which country's history do you have the most positive relations with
> we were basicaly slaves in "our" empire
Maybe if you paid attention in the history class you would be more secure about these parts of the history (and I don't say they are too positive)
You can look it up anytime if you want
I know it sounds super condescending, sorry for that
>Also how is my sentence about Samo subjective but yours about Moravia isnt
Just look at the constitution you mentioned
Or compare the information on these two subjects in the wiki pages
Or in the school books
Monuments, books, places named after GM personalities
I even find the GM stuff quite overblown in today's Slovak culture, we learn much more about it
On the other hand, we know very little about Samo's Empire overall, the connection to modern Slovaks and Slovakia is even much weaker than to GM, which is understandable
> I dont think why else would a kid at elementary school have anti-hungarian ideas other than what is teached, maybe teachers portrayed it in very bad way during lessons about Empire
Dunno but Im preety sure we were portrayed as opressed minority in the books
I mean yeah they dont write in book that HATE HUNGARY/HUNGARY BAD, obviously
Well, if you learn the history very superficially and focus on the worst parts, it definitely does give you a certain view, even though a very blurry one
The rest is then filled with random negative memories and emotions passed from generation to generation, frustrated teachers, hardcore nationalist groups, negative confrontations with the other side (who often also see you just as the biggest evil)
There definitely are many historical facts in the books which can be pretty infuriating to learn, the key is not to become too emotional about them
I know I may have sounded like a dickhead at times, just I mean this uncertain hate is what various people abuse in their favor
I wanted to say it's all about the interpretation of history and sticking to the facts
Old habits die hard but maybe the edu system is really failing as well
Huh, welp I might have got it wrong, maybe it is just a distorted memory on my part, waaaait, [look] what I found ! There ! the old slovak language form I was talkin about, and that is hella anti hungarian in my eye
" The National Council declares that in the name of the Czech-Slovak nation living within the borders of Hungary, only it is entitled to speak and act
The Hungarian government is not entitled to this, which for decades has not known more serious tasks, such as suppressing everything that is Slovak, did not build and allow our nation or a single school, did not allow the Slovak people to get into public administration and offices, destroying our people
and exploited its medieval feudal system and politics
&#x200B;
Pretty "opressed minority / hungary bad" feeling from that text
&#x200B;
But yeah, that aint no constitution, but this is the document I was supporting my claims with
Okay so you've got from a hateful constitution and being slaves for 150 years to a legit historical document of the Declaration from 1918
\- literally stating "the Hungarian government" not "Hungarians bad".
\- written quite dramatically given the times, but describing the real policy of magyarization and the real poor social and cultural conditions of Slovaks in the last DECADES of the Empire, which the declaration naturally reacted to
If you compare it to your initial comment, it's something quite different
>Hungary - the uter hatred towards hungary is felt thru all of our history books, and our constitution
Well yeah, this is the one thing I was refering to in one sentence I said not the whole argument, the rest I dont care enough to research
In 100 years, highway from Bratislava to Košice will still be 4 more years away from being finished
You’re being optimistic
In Slovakia we mostly meme our politicians (or some minor celebrities)
I am afraid it is not interestimg unless you know the news
Also Vihreät kuulat, although that might be just r/suomi
The best one is "drž už piču Erik
Czechia no doubt
I mean do I have to say anything at all :D? We speak almost the same language , have the same traditions and we share now more than 100 years of history
Then after Czechoslovakia was over we had a peaceful "divorce". I sometimes fantasize how would Czechoslovakia look like in the present
The breakup is a big controversy
Anyways relations with Czechia are best than ever
Czechs are for me definitely more than brothers, whenever I am in Czech Republic I feel like as if I am home in Slovakia :)
brothers till hockey starts
Well you were neighbours for a loong time
Sorry for separating you
Till literally anything competitive starts
They are not the same, the grammar is very different
We can understand each other because the vocabulary is pretty similar and because of mutual exposure
That is why we do not understand polish that easy because their vocab is much different and grammar as well - but still it is very easy to learn if we are exposed to it
The difference is more distinct
While most of our words do sound the same, there are far to many spelling differences
The english language differences are more like accents
Czech and Slovak are clearly two different languages, just very similar
Hey we don't need you
We have Czechs
I will be frank, never have I not been able to tell right away
I do enjoy the border bluriness though
Český a Slovenský jazyk su vzájomne rozumiteľné

(Slovakia) I'd make it the rainbow LGBTQ flag - I'm not even gay, I'd just love to mess with the bigots and homophobes that make up a large portion of the population here
Without the crown though
Having a crown there would imply monarchy
Exactly like that but I would put furries in there
Just to make it worse
Why would you remove it
It's not complex at all, just three hills and double cross
Most western people can't really distinguish Slovak from Czech, Russian or most slavic languages
But I have also heard that Slovak is kind of a "Slavic Esperanto" because most slavic people can understand it clearly without knowing it
i really don't know what people think of my language, others tell me how would you describe slovak language ?
People usually say that Slovak sounds like Russian
Some people have also told me that it sounds like I’m upset when I speak Slovak
Czechs in general like Slovak language, they think it is softer than Czech and melodic and Czech men think it's sexy when Slovak woman is speaking it
Polish people think Slovak sounds funny and childish (curiously, Slovaks think the same about Polish language)
Non-Slavic people usually think it's Russian
a lot of slovaks describe german as "the sound of a chainsaw"
it really sounds like spanish, but with difference that i understand no words
ah, pich accent, he will do lot of problems during time i will learn swedish xD
for people from Slovakia both Czech and Polish sound funny lol
I would like to thank to our Czech bros for helping us in newly formed Czechoslovakia by building infrastructure , building schools and gymnasiums and sending their teachers
We wouldn't be where we are now without you guys :)
Germany for being a political role model (though you're fucking it up with AfD lately)
Austria for being a economic and social role model (so we see how to improve ourselves in this regard)
Hungary for being a cautionary tale (in politics) and teaching us delicious food
Poland for being bros (every Pole I've met during my travels was a total coolio)
Ukraine for showing us shit could be a lot worse :)
Czechs for
well
everything I guess
US for NATO and taking in our countrymen during periods of strife, also cherry pepsi, love that shit
Russia for
uhm
eeerh
yea
ushankas are cizy in winter I guess
I'll go with both to our brothers Czechs
Thank you for educating our ancestors during the monarchy, some of our greatest Slovaks studied in Czechia/Moravia
Thank you for electing communists after WW2, those 40 years were enjoyable
How is your Czech wife
Nicely kept public places, functioning services, overall your country side looks nicer than here, people seem to care, general sense of "ordnung", better roads, newer trains, bigger cities have great public transport schemes
Austrians look overall more caring about their environment than us, more woke
"You cross the border to Austria, X actually works unlike the PoS X in here
We want to live in a country like that and a lot of people look up to you with regards to all this
S-senpai
No one is Russophobe
Just cause we hate what Putin and his cronies are doing doesn't mean we hate all Russians
Same propaganda shit is in China, oh the west hates what CCP is doing, they racist abd hate all Chinese, it's racism guys, not disagreement with glorious Chinese government
The fuckhuge Russia propaganda machine has its tentacles all over Europe
UKIP was financed by them undirectly, lots of eurosceptic groups here have ties to Kremlin as well
It's kinda hard being indifferent towards a country radicalusing a bombarding your citizens with fake news oropaganda, translated word for word from Russian
Nice whataboutism
One party doing x does not excuse and normalise other party doing x. Both are wrong and the US gets a lot of shit for its bullshit
Doesn't excuse Russia just yoinking a part of neighbor's sovereign land though
If they fear being attacked by NATO why don't they join
We joined cause we were afraid of Russia
Oh, they don't join cause then they can't invade whoever they want
Aaaah ok
Yes we do, but its old door so it's not much for security purposes as it is for "stay closed pls" purposes
Our plot is fenced and the entrance door does not have a handle from neither side
The house itself is not locked
Never, even when nobody is home
The house front door has also no handle on the outside, but the terrace doors can be easily opened from the outside
Am i afraid that somebody comes at night and tries something stupid
Nobody in his right mind would do that, knowing my temper and size
Am i afraid that somebody robs us while we are not at home

Minus the corona, our head of the government was in a serious car crash
He has again had become a butt of the jokes because in the car with him, in a state car, was a suspiciously playmate looking ex miss
Probably mommy number 11
And we put one of the corrupted judges in the jail
So the corruption saga continues
While one goes to jail, the other keeps enjoying state money for his orgies with women
I seriously don't get how can people vote for Boris Kollar
He is the epitome of mafia and corruption
Oh you are still hearing about it in Belgium
Good, I think here it was swallowed by our corona news
But people were outraged when it came out
Good that his wife's dared to expose them, that was very brave of her
He is head of parliament, bot government, but I agree with you
Yeah, to be fair I didn't know how to translate his title in that moment
Masaryk University in Brno
That or Charles's University in Prague
And no, I'm not joking
However, Charles' MFF is still the best in teaching math, physics or (theoretical) computer science
From what I've seen, čvut is still a lot behind on these, although the nuclear faculty's physics department is very solid
I guess my own country is quite underwhelming from a tourist perspective, partly because all neighbouring countries eclipse us in anything we can offer to a tourist
The Alps are bigger than Tatras, Hungarian spa have already gained world recognition (unlike Bardejov, Dudince or Piešťany), beer and drinking/partying tourism is more developed in Czechia, Germany has larger and more beautiful castles (yes, I know they're not neighbours, but whatever), Poles have more infamous concentration camps
Anyway, my top pick is North Macedonia
They have even not managed to achieve infamy, like Moldova for being objectively the poorest or Albania for their human and drug trafficking
North Macedonia for me is just a perfectly blank page
I think all of europe is interesting and worthy of beeing around Slovakia
But trust me, people from uninteresting countries, all you have to do, is become Slovakia to be interesting again
Two interesting things about Moldova are, that there is both the largest and the second largest wine cellar in the world located in the country, near the capital
They are so huge that visitors have to be transported by cars inside
And they have some good wine stored there
Even Vladimir Putin celebrated his 50th birthday there
The second interesting thing I observe is the resemblance of the country's president [Igor Dodon] with the Looney Tunes character Elmer Fudd
Rude
True, but rude
The most interesting things are way back in history or it’s just common Slavic stereotypes we all share
Hahaha that subforum
Great to find out that not only Australia does not exist
That is kindaa an ignorant view
I feel like people believe that 30 years we spend as an allied country to soviets would somehow erase all the thousands of years of history before
The only history we have with Russians now is WW2 memorabilia and yet that is still more connected to national resistance fighters
Majority of out traditions are not in any way connected to Russians
They are connected mostly to Austrian Hungarian empire, then to our ehm fight with Austrian Hungarian empire, you know the place we spend hundreds of years with
It would be like only connecting Germany to nazis
Do people not learn history or what
I assure you Slovakia also has tourist traps to offer but again, they are eclipsed by the Ukrainian
Besides Bratislava, there are the Tatra moutains, various castles/castle ruins (Spiš castle is listed on the UNESCO world heritage list), folk architecture (Čičmany, Bardejov, Levoča), the spa I mentioned, some caves (which, again, is a thing that Slovenia has larger and better promoted worldwide) and that's pretty much it
I've been to Tallinn for one day, BTW, and that's pretty much everything I know about Estonia
What would you pick
Czechs got it as well
Kecskemét has always reminded me of "Kočkomet", which would be a "cat-thrower" in Czech ;)
Also, hello from Nyitra
Also, I used to have a username Sir d'Emental or Sir de Mental  in online games
Czechs have Becherovka, which has been manufactured since the 19th century
Hungarian Unicum can be traced back to 1790
Polish Zubrowka was created probably in the evening of the 6th day (judging by the claim God had to rest on the 7th)
TatraTea is only a very recent brand and I feel it still needs some time to gain more recognition worldwide
Sami ste si ho zvolili, nesťažujte sa
Fun fact: Capital city Bratislava is third greenest capital city in the world
Give that man a slice of Karabakh
>varied architecture
the unifying hallmark are bullet holes
The names are Milestii Mici (the largest, visitors get to drive their own car inside) and Cricova (the one with Putin; tourists are driven by road trains)
You also have Toruń, Krakow, Wroclaw, Poznań, Gdansk -all are beautiful cities- Wieliczka, Licheń Stary cathedral and Malbork castle
I just wanted to point out indirectly that we, too, have a history of holocaust to offer to dark tourists
But I don't see your lakes as an advantage, unless you get rid of all mosquitos in the region :(
I wonder where that’s from, considering we’ve got a oil refinery not even that far away from the main parts
I like history, so I kinda learn on my own, but we generally covered Europe quite well in the gymnasium
So that helped
Maybe it was the type of the school too
But i don't doubt it, as there wasn't really Slovakia before
It was Czechoslovakia and before that Austrian Hungarian empire and before that Samo land
And before than we had some celts I think
And some cave dudes
Generally the history of a small new country is hidden within the other countries history, similar with Balcan countries or Baltics
So for example in WW1 slovakians were forced to fight for Austrian Hungarian empire, even if all we wanted was to join the independence movements
And some did I think
Defected the army
But that war worked out quite nice for us
Moravian empire was good times
Everything after that to 1918 is meh
Obviously I simplified
Google search "Sir Parmesan Karl May" returns nothing substantial
are you sure a German writer was making puns in slavic languages
Strange that he did not name Latvia, because out of the three of you, they are the ones I think about the least
They are like emergency backup Lithuania
Now that you've shut down Ignalina, I don't know why do they still exist
Its from 2018
And it was by metres per kilometer with trees
Bratislava has very much parks and forests
Koliba, Pečniansky les, Lesopark, Horský park etc
That’s true
At least we’ve got something going for us
Though in recent Slovak news I’ve read we have scary high pollution numbers in the air
>Tito
Thats nice but we didnt have him
We had a nazi called Tiso
And as you recall WW2 had a genocide
Slovakia was  nazi state so yes, the regime commited genocide
But you are aware "sir" (or "syr") means cheese in all slavic language, right
V-E-R-Y corrupt
Ours parliament is separated to three groups
Group A is trying to steal as much they can by appealing to elder population
Group B is trying to stop Group A from stealing by appealing to older adults, but since the elders are voting more they can't succeed
Group C are fascists
Like, literal extremists that are using the chaos and hate to win some votes by appealing to young people
Basically mix of Hitler, Mussolini and Tiso
Group A and C are racing for votes while Group B is just trying to survive
At least this is how I understand our current politics
Slovakia, btw
Wow, where to begin
Helping Vietnam abduct a person using our government plane, giving 300M€ for education and research to companies that existed only a few days and made 0€ so far, the crystal clear connections to the Slovak and Italian mafia, claiming the massive deforestation in geometric shapes and export of trees is happening because of climate change then claiming it's still forest even when it's all cut down, the almost literal bootlicking of our speaker of the parliament to Russia and Putin
I think you now have a brief idea
Not much tho , there were some cases during '00
Depends on what should we protest against first
Older slovaks - those born during Communism - are too lazy to actually demand something
We are actually protesting a lot, but there's too much things
Also group A is full of smart lawyers that know how to fuck up the system right, so we can't really do anything other than radical things
Last time we protested against our (now) ex-prime minister he quit so he would not suffer consequences and our new prime minister is just his pawn
(They are in the same party) Then there are the extremists
The problem with those is that they are not doing anything - yet
They are strongly against gypsies (gypsies are actually scared of them) and since gypsies are huge problem in our country white people are with the extremists
The leader of that group - Marián Kotleba - is just pure dictator material
He was imprisoned when younger for extremism, but somehow people still vote for him
The worst problem with them is that they want to sort of cut ties with EU and cooperate with Russia more, but since even Russia criticize him, they won't cooperate, leading our country to be alone for the first time (excluding V4)
Now that I think of it our politics are fucked
We are state with great police services, but since they are under government, which is kind of like mafia, it's useless on high level
I'll probably move out when I grow up
That is 100% the same situation, perfectly described
Hopefully it will be better in Romania, for us in Slovakia it's really hard now, we will have elections in a month and the govenment parties have a decline but a lot of the votes for them moved to the neonazis (actualy neonazis, I don't use such terms lightly) who have no programme at all, are grossly incompetent and lazy as hell (based on their parliamentary activities throughout the last 4 years)
[This song] came out only few months ago but it had awesome reviews and I personaly really like it
Tallinn-Helsinki undersea tunnel, Fehmarn Belt fixed link, Messina bridge, Adriatic-Ioannic highway
Highway connecting Bratislava and Košice of course
It's being built since 1972 and it's still maybe 65 % only done ?
Highway to China
And China will pay for it
Can you imagine that road trip
Ever realized that Madrid, Toulouse, Lyon, Geneva, Bern, Zurich, Prague, Wroclaw, Lodz, Warsaw, Minsk, Smolensk and Moscow are all located on the same line (or at least their suburbs)
I see it as the backbone
It's funny how we can't build one simple highway, but we sure as hell can build another bridge across the Danube, or a dam, or anything else that isn't a highway to Kosice because of "problematic terrain". Switzerland has a problematic terrain yet they have several highways
Honestly it is sad, construction started before my mother has been born
I think it was one orb to years ago that there was literally built less distance of that highway than snail can move per year
It is not exactly collinear
Faro is, though
Maybe it would comfort them that there is no German city on the route at all
In reality, the largest happened to be Ingolstadt, but I don't find it significant enough to stop there
Of course, if the train could zig-zag a little, Munich would be included, maybe also Zaragoza and Bialystok
Nice one
I also found Amsterdam-Düsseldorf-Frankfurt-Munich and Hamburg-Berlin-Wroclaw-Krakow
Not really, only the Pyrenees
It dodges both the Alps and the Carpathians
Yes
Yes
Totally
I freaking love trains
I love them as a kid because it eas the only place I wasnt sick and still do
Its so nice and comfy
You just chill, look at the countryside,can read, have space to walk, can go to a restaurant, even have someone going around with food
Even can sleep there
High speed train network is my ultimate goal for EU
With or without Olivenza
I am sorry, but no matter how how I try, I can't fit Milan, Basel and Luxemburg onto the first line and Bucharest and Varna are also way off on the second
I agree that EU has build quite satisfactory system of not entirely straight railways, I'm here only for the compulsive mental masturbation
Oh surely, just because it's biscuit sized, shaped and is eaten like a biscuit means nothing since it doesn't crunch
By that logic a fucking crisp is a biscuit isn't IS THAT WHAT YOIU WANT CHAOS AND ANARCHY
I'M SURROUNDED BY MAD MEN, MAD MEN I SAY
> Another debate is wether those small breads are called
Kaiserka/kaizerka
Henceforth, I shall call my toiler a "serník".
Not many tourists know we exists, so our national parks and nature is clean and silent, as it should be
“Medvedík čistotný” for us, something along “clean little bear”
Noooo
I love that song
I randomly discovered it while searching for German songs
It's just an unapologetic bop, best for summer parties
and then pewdiepie came and made that song popular everywhere
Such a good song
It played during my graduation party
It's simple, but there probably isn't a party in Slovakia that doesn't play this song at least once
EGO really struck gold with it
As a non russian I know only two contemporary russian groups
Leningrad and Little Big
Is  not popular in Russia
Give it a few years
Don't you remember switching the radio with those songs too
Nah, that's just an example of a typical Slovak gangster/rapper/douche looking dude
We have tonnes of these guys in the country
Wow, holy shit
Some people are, luckily not most of them
But I know that one person bought 100 KILOS of flour in our small local grocery store, so there's that
Also, it's been harder to find oil, flour, pasta, and bottled water in certain shops, since some paranoid folks have been panic buying in bulk
excuse me but between me and my bf it's him using a shit ton of tp, so yeah but also no
I mean I understand stockpiling canned food and shit, since going outside will be prohibited and you are scared you will starve (still ridiculously overblown, but at least some sense is there)
But toiletpaper
If shit hits the fan (heh), imma just wash my ass, whats the big deal
It's like buying 1000 condoms, yes if quarantine hits we gon be fuckin to pass the time but are condoms so essential to survival
Whelp
I think I finally found my word
I always had this feeling in my life
Ignác, Bonifác, pretty much everything ending on ác. Fucking awful
>Horst, Herbert, Jürgen
Are these names really frowned upon
As a german-speaking Slovak, I find them quite likeable
I feel like you're excluding a certain part of your history and ultimately Germany itself
Small things like names
Dynamo, Photographic objective, helicopter, damn I'm surprised how many cool stuff was invented by people of Slovak origin
Parachute by Štefan Banič. He immigrated to USA but he was born in Slovakia (Austria-Hungary in that time)
And both his parents were also Slovak
Driving laws
Different countries have different max speeds, different allowed blood alcohol content, different mandatory lights on laws
In some countries you have to stop before a pedestrian crossing if you see a pedestrian waiting there, in others you don’t.
It would be best if you could just pay for public transport with your regular Credit Card
It’s already possible in some places (e.g. London)
This can be triple the fun in central europe because
- the national rail operators (ZSSK, CD, MAV, PKP, DB, OBB, ...) work together and re-sell each other’s tickets but the commercial ones do not
- the prices differ when you buy a ticket online and at a station
And when you travel to a different country each country’s operator has its own prices again (which can again differ online and at a station)
So e.g. Bratislava - Praha can have at least 5 different ticket prices (because you can also buy return ticket at a station which has again a different price)
- When combined this can be even more fun because you can also buy a czech ticket online at the czech site for a trip that takes place entirely in Slovakia
And it can sometimes be cheaper than buying locally (it usually doesn’t happen though, but can and does still happen sometimes)
You can buy tickets from Bratislava to Breclav and then from Breclav to Warsaw on CD
cz and it should work
Older people in Slovakia don’t speak/understand English
In bigger stations we have specialized counters for “International routes” where they speak English
We also have “Customer centers” (often hidden in a corner of a station or behind one) where you can buy tickets as well and they speak English too
When I was in London all I did was tap my iPhone and it worked in buses, metro and trains
It calculates the best ticket prices for you and only actually charges you at the end of the day
There is a daily and a weekly cap equivalent to a daily/weekly paper ticket
I don’t know if you can buy a monthly ticket on your CC but you can get a contactless “oyster” card for that and I believe contactless is a better technology than magnetic cards (magnetic cards can be demagnetized and then they need to be repaired
There are some ATMs which check for the card’s origin country and request a fee if the card’s not local
(Mainly the Euronet network seen in multiple countries but some local ones as well (seen in some local banks in HU and CZ))
Also DCC is still offered sometimes even if you use Revolut
I got DCC questions sometimes even if I’m using non-Revolut EUR card in another EUR paying country
Revolut only helps with currency conversion fees and bank fees (and even then has a fee if you need to withdraw more than 200eur monthly)
Visa/Mastercard/whatever
on each card the first 4, 6 or 8 numbers identify issuing bank and country
You can try it for yourself on
I have 3 cards that don’t charge fees for withdrawing abroad including N26 and Revolut, all of them have euro as base currency
The thing is it’s not only the bank which can charge a fee but also the ATM
(The fee is displayed before you actually get to withdraw if applicable)

Weeeell, aaaactually, most of the original devs of Beat Saber are Slovaks so
But the rest are awesome
Yeah, if I recall correctly the devs are Slovaks who were studying in Brno and most of the original music was made by a Czech guy
One Czech journalist tried what would happen with water in -15 degrees C.
The water froze
oh germany
Dont know about this particular case, but last year we pretty much deported 7 russian diplomats for such behaviour - for spreading propaganda and financing "alternative media" and local individuals involved, and a for managing fake companies to avoid russian ban for exports

Well, the actions of the Entente after the war were the main reason why WWII was even possible
How to annoy your neighbour 101
after you fucked them up pretty badly too, right
Same in Slovakia, we drink Kofola way more than Coca Cola or Pepsi
English
Or original
I have to have everything in original for some reason
Depends
Most often in English, but there are times, when the dub is pretty good and enhances the experience
Like, I would not want to play Warcraft 3 without the Czech dub, it's just too good and iconic
Or Mafia 1/2, but those are Czech made, of course, so it makes sense
Never
I basically only play Dota 2 and it has a Czech language option, but categorisation is very important in dota
A silence and a mute is not the same and things like that
Yeah I feel like it’s the same way in Slovakia
We don’t have many cities but a lot of people in the capital and in a couple few bigger cities often think of people living in villages as simple, stupid or conservative
It’s obviously not always true but when you look at any election results and see which part of the country voted for which party, it kind of just confirms it
I think this works for most of EU
Citydwellers see them as hillbillies and vice versa, though plenty of rural people travel to Capital for work and most of the people from Capital travel to county for weekends
Is it's just friendly picking on each other
Yep
Two languages is like nothing nothing
I need to do better
I am learning french for now and wanna add Spanish later, so I won't confuse them much
Then need to pick up something non European as Japanese or Swahlili

Do you know if you invoked Tunguzija before 1908
Aj to, aj kukátko
[Tuto] sa môžeš zasvätiť do základov slovenského punku
You must be the other end
Yes, but in 1908 it was rather famously hit by an asteroid
I mean, maybe they invoked it even before the asteroid, merely because how remote it was
Its not prohibited to leave (just to enter for any non-resident), but anyone returning from abroad is required to quarantine at home-isolation for 14 days, otherwise 2000 EUR fine will be issued
Our medical system has been systematically robbed and words "on verge of collapse" have been used more than once well before coronavirus
The strict measures taken by general hygienist are due to that knowlegde
If pandemic erups, system won't cope, no chance of that
And do you know why does US have so many skyscrapers
Because your cities were planned long after the cities of Europe
My city became city in 1255, but it was probably started a lot sooner, so then the population was really just a few people and more complex planning wasn’t a thing back then
Cities which do have skyscrapers are those which were bombarded in the WWII because they had to rebuild basically from scratch and technology was able to produce skyscrapers
But it is more problem of space, because first cities in Europe was builded on mud and it was more organicly organized, while US bulided on more solid roads, with grid roads and later highways in mind
European cities also centered around castles and so that is something US never had to consider in it’s planning
I would accept banning buildings over 250m... in Budapest there was a ban over 100m until recently
in Bratislava it depends on the neighborhood, some neighborhoods don’t allow more than 5 stories and I’m not talking about the historic old town now
“Schovaný, neschovaný, idem

Well, it comes as no surprise to me, it’s probably the common history
Pravdupovediac ani nie, ale myslím si, že to každé dieťa pozná z televízie a občas sa môže stať, že to použijú namiesto tej verzie, ktorú som písal vyššie
Ono tým, že značné množstvo detských rozprávok pozerajú preložených v češtine (keďže slovenský ekvivalent neexistuje) sa môže stať, že začnú používať niektoré výrazy z češtiny bez toho aby si to vôbec uvedomovali
Na čom, samozrejme, nie je nič zlé, keďže naše jazyky sú si také podobné a značné množstvo našej populácie používa takzvané bohemizmy úplne prirodzene, len skrátka nie sú spisovné podľa našich slovníkov

Why some austrians going to shopping to Slovakia trash things
From my own experience, because it's cheap and students love to mix it in large quantities of juice
Terrible hangover though
Thankfully palinka is much more widespread in the south
It's really better  especially the homemade stuff
Yes, I always see very much austrian cars with sign Burgenland or Wien in front of Tesco and then going out from shop with cheap and trash food what novody buying
I dont understand this
Many actually, especially for food products like Nutella (chocolate/nuts cream), Salko (condensed milk), horalky (typical slovak bisccuit/candy), cif (cleaning for your sink), Jar/pur (this soap for cleaning dishes), granko (chocolate granules), inka(coffe like drink - like nestle caró)
just off the top of my head
>And almost all of us call a hairdryer "Fön"
It is literally the official word used here "Fén" for hairdryer
In Slovak it’s also the same but we borrowed it not from Slavic, but Hungarian (at least that’s what I got from the fact Hungarian have the same words)
It’s šarkan - in Hungary sárkány
In Slovák, it’s the same we have two words for a dragon - “drak ” and “ šarkan” both of which can signify a dragon or a kite
It seems we stole "šarkan" from you and use it almost interchangibly with "drak" for both dragons and kites
"Šarkan" usually stands for dragon in older literature, folk fairy tales, while "drak" is more contemporary and comprehensive
I somehow never seen a stupid or disrespectful tourist, all those i met were curious and decent
Maybe just me not actually visiting tourist spots often i dunno
I must say I'm guilty of taking pictures at cemeteries
They are interesting in some strange way
It's usually just a picture of an interesting gravestone tho
One instance we actually took a picture with a gravestone was when we found our family name on a cemetery in Barcelona which was quite unexpected discovery
In Bratislava, capital of Slovakia we use the term CéPéčkari  which is based on a popular website cp
sk, this website shows Public Transport schedules(Cestovné Poriadky)
It is believed that every true CéPéčkar uses this website to get to the capital because they are too poor to own a car
Another meaning is an older one, called Cez Poľný, meaning Over the field
Implying that people have to get through the fields in order to reach the capital city
Touting them as farmers, villagers etc
Same here, but instead of vidlák we have "sedlák". It's used mostly by Bratislava people, and it's even in their dialect
Like, when you use the standard form "sedliak" it just means a farmer
But if you use the Bratislava dialect "sedlák"  it has the implicit derogatory meaning of redneck or someone who doesn't live in the "big city".
(As if Bratislava wasn't just a village compared to rest of Europe)
> It's december 28
What a weird way to celebrate my birthday
From I noticed here, majority of the Europeans(including) prefer jeans and t-shirt, if we talk about outdoors/work/school
If you live in border region (like me in Bratislava), it's very common
My gf lives in Hungary, my mother in Austria, me in Slovakia, and yet we are all only 15-20 minutes by car from each other
It's also extremly common for Slovaks to live in border villages in Austria or Hungary (cheap housing) and commute across border to Bratislava to work or school
Many people also live in Bratislava and commute to Vienna in Austria for work
Also really common among people here is to go grocery shopping to Austria, or for Austrians to go shopping to Bratislava in sunday (shops are closed on sunday in Austria, but open here)
In terms of people moving around, you can easily compare EU countries to US states
Sometimes you may not even notice that you entered different country (well but now things are more complicated thanks to covid)
As a guy living relatively close to the borders (\~10 kilometers) of Czechia and Slovakia, I sometimes cross the border on my bike without even realizing
Since you should carry your ID even if you're in your own home country, it really feels just like traveling from one region of Slovakia to another)
Apart from slight difference in language and the fact we've got Euro and Czechs still hold onto their silly currency, using it to squeeze some extra cash out other Europeans at any opportunity\*, it really isn't any kind of a big deal
&#x200B;
\*For example, you'd like to park at the parking near some Zoo - if you pay in Czech crowns, you pay 90 crowns
If you par in Euro, you pay 4 euro (\~105 crowns)
Currency exchange is also a hassle - If you find yourself in Prague near Florenc and need to get on the last tube, you can bet you're gonna have bad time if you don't have enough Czech cash on you
The card terminal on the ticket machine often doesn't work (or plain isn't there) and the only currency exhanges nearby are run by Russians, who'll give you a paper to sign with incredibly unfair (and possibly illegal) conditions - such as paying over 5 euro just for the privilege of exchanging
Sorry, I'm bitter
Eastern Slovak dialect is influenced by both German and Hungarian
to iron clother - bigľovať - from German "bügeln"
city - varoš - from Hungarian "város"
hat - kalap - from Hungarian "kalap"
breakfast - frištik - from German "Frühstück"
There's a lot more German in Slovak, that you'd never think are loanwords because they are just so very basic
Cibuľa (Zwiebel), cieľ (Ziel), kritizovať (kritizieren), plech (Blech), žemľa (Semmel), etc
It's Czech
Virtually everyone can understand it and I'd say 75% of the population could hold a conversation on any topic
The 25 % is the youngest generation, although they watch Czech cartoons too, I am certain
What does the question mean
Does it include minorities, or we talk foreign language
If minorities, hungarian than gypsy, if foreign, then most likely german
Czech, it’s so similar even a toddler in Slovakia can speak Czech
How many serbians live in switzerland
I wouldn't be so sure about it
Yes, almost all Slovaks claim to speak it, but I dare to say not even 50% would be able to speak a few sentences without mistakes
(I myself when not sure about a Czech word use a Slovak word with ř or some Czech sounding noise in it
Considering there is cca
a half million of Hungarians, Hungarian would be the country's most spoken second language, when excluding English
I was considering German for a moment, but I'm not sure if there are enough speakers to outweigh the Hungarians, even though there is a high no
of German companies present
Even 50% is more than half a million Hungarian speakers
Also, I've never said anything about being fluent or perfect in Czech but I am certain that if we consider the overall level of literacy, Czech is the 2nd  most known/spoken language in Slovakia
When it comes to German, you're way off
I work for a German Automotive company in Bratislava and only the top management speak German, the middle management I'd say 50% and workers close to 0 %.
P.s.: I appreciate your input but I'd like for you to substantiate your thought next time
I think majority of people would have no problem actually speaking Czech
We would sound like idiots, yes, but we could do it, if we wanted to
>Even 50% is more than half a million Hungarian speakers
Yes
>...Czech is the 2nd most known/spoken language in Slovakia
I mean, point taken, it's just that mutually intelligibility shouldn't be counted as knowing the other language, but have it your way
>When it comes to German, you're way off
Well, you might be surprised - [click] - [click] I live in a region with a high German proficiency, your anecdotal evidence doesn't mean it can't be true
Very popular
It will die down tho once they legalize it
Sounds like Slovakia
No, but I plan on moving to Czechia for at least a few years, maybe even stay
It's not like we're different countries culturally, and I kinda don't care about politics, so I don't even count it to "leaving" my country
Thats why I like being an EU citizen
I can go to live anywhere I want without giving a reason or getting some “points” like in australia
Well technically majority of our politicians were born in a different country
Unless we fill it with under 30 year olds
I dont know why, but i really love the French for that
Where are my Czech brothers
I have no idea who started it
Mostly jokes based on stereotypes, stealing, cheating on ones wife and politics (but that one is synonymous to stealing)

Has any politician in Your country suffered a nervous breakdown during live broadcast
This pretty much made headlines today in Slovakia
Our prime minister Igor Matovič was roasted for half an hour by a radio talk show host, towards whom the PM was remarkably submissive, and in the end the host announced him, that one of the PM's political partners, the minister of economy Richard Sulík, had once again overtly defied his strategy to fight the pandemics, to which the PM reacted in live broadcast not too unlike Hitler in the famous scene from Der Untergang, first ranting against Sulík and demanding his demission, then breaking down and almost crying, powerlessly
There are recordings of the broadcast available online, although only in Slovak, which is maybe good, because I really felt sorry for the PM, as I admire his genuine dedication to the fight against the pandemics, which is something that shouldn't be mocked in any case, but I wonder if any such thing has ever happened elsewhere, because I don't remember a similar scene in the history of my country's politics and I wonder how special it really is
I am kind of sorry for him, for the situation in which he took over the country
I mean, imagine that you get a job as bus driver
You go for your first shift, and you receive bus that has no brakes, uncontrollable engine and is on fire
Of course, there was also [Vladimír I-will-punch-the-f\*\*k-out-of-you Mečiar] but I consider it a different kind of breakdown
Honestly I don’t blame him, he’s just a human after all, and opposition is giving him a hard fight, as most of their friends are getting jailed due to their corruption scandals, which should have been done years ago
Not only that, but also some of the coalition members are undermining him constantly
That being said, I agree that he should be more diplomatic when presenting stuff and try to avoid saying certain things in public before having consulted them in private
I saw the headline and immediately recognized the country haha
I am sorry for him too
When you look at the numbers, you can tell the plan with rapid antigen testing might have just worked, had it been performed at least on a monthly basis and compulsory
And then you arbitrarily flail with the steering wheel and get angry at passengers pointing out that you just set the course off a cliff
Yes, the situation is hard
But let's not pretend that he is doing anything remotely competent
Even his "great success" in the mass testing was succesful *despite* him not *because of* him
Putting up with Putin is certainly not for teetotallers
Finally, a politician who wasn't afraid to address the elephant in the room
^Don't ^worry, ^I'll ^show ^myself ^out
Something tells me this is going to happen also with Matovič very soon
I've seen public toilet attendants less frustrated with their job

The PM then goes on, blames Sulík publically for about 5 minutes, requests him to resign, and until the rest of the interview, you can hear in his voice, that he is about to weep (more than usually)
Towards the end of the interview, he implies he himself is considering resignation
It was only a radio talk show, so the PM does not appear on screen
Thank You, I find Italy strangely underrepresented in the comments
Surely, you must have seen so many scenes like this with your politicians on your TV, that it's hard to recall a specific one
Nice
Very nice indeed
I swear I have heard the name before but only now I know, why is it so sound
I'm afraid You won't enjoy it very much, as it was only a radio talk show, the PM does not even appear on screen and you can only hear his voice, speaking Slovak

From 34:00 he delivers a short Christmas speech to the people where he apologizes for ruining everyone's Christmas with lockdown, because of an *idiot* minister, as he puts it
There are some countries that manage well
For example Finland or New Zaeland have been pretty good
NZ example is impossible to use when compared to Europe
Slovakia is not an island somewhere far away where its easy to close the borders down
Finlad is better comparision, yet they just have better hospitals and that's something we miss
Well, I personally don't agree with everything he does, but I understand that in his place I probably wouldn't do better
Many people are angry at him for 'restricting their rights' and the more extreme ones for 'trying to chip them'. The fact that Matovič doesn't speak like a politician (calmly and composedly) plus uses stupid facebook post to announce vital information doesn't help
He had beef with Sulík (for about 2 months I guess
) because Sulík 'wasn't listening to his orders'. This was the lat drop I guess
Well, it wasn't exactly Bruno Ganz type of breakdown, but I feel the whole interview was very emotional and if you play the last minute, from 34:00, I think you can tell the man sounds was almost crying
By the way, an hour ago it was announced he had been tested positive too
What are you talking about
In the first lockdown they did close the borders completely
Slovakia got no more traffic that NZ
Also, cross-border infections make for a tiny minority of cases
NZ is doing much better internally than Slovakia, which makes the island argument invalid

NZ is doing much better internally than Slovakia, which makes the island argument invalid
Because NZ can afford to lock itself down
Slovakia cant
We depend on our neighbours too much
The first lock down happened because people were scared of the virus that no one really experienced much here
But we realises unlike NZ we cant keep it for a long time, because we simply have no capacity to
Its much easier to close off an island than a country in the middle of Europe thats has numerous roads and entry points and is part of Shengen
Basically the whole poland orava wedding issue would not be able to happen in NZ because they simply can't cross the water easily to go party to a different country
Therefore being an island helps
Its much easier to contain people inside a country that is locked in by the ocean
Thats why small island countries usually had good covid numbers
So if you want to compare NZ to some countries in Europe, choose Cyprus or Malta
our head of parliament - Andrej Danko, and also some other politicans, also few years ago there was joke that eastern slovakia doesn't exist because our prime minister said that
You mean "supreme monarch with virtually unlimited power, to rule the Russian serfs until the heat death of the universe, being a half-cyborg half-demigod, like the emperor of man".
Please use the full title, thank you
Hungarians and Romanians are natural enemies
Like Austrians and Hungarians
Or Yougoslavs and Hungarians
Or Slovaks and Hungarians
Or Hungarians and other Hungarians
Damn Hungarians they ruined Hungary
Your joke reminded me of another
After a hockey match between the USSR and Czechoslovakia, where the latter were victorious, the Czechoslovak ministry of Foreign affairs received the following telegram:
was a good match STOP
you were clearly the better team STOP
looking forward to a rematch STOP
oil STOP
gas STOP
There's this good one I ~~stole~~ borrowed from the movie "Lives of Others"
Erich Honecker (East German communist leader) opens a window in the morning and says: "Good morning Sun
"Good morning Erich", answers the sun
In the afternoon again he opens the window and says "good afternoon Sun", he says
The suns replies again: "Good afternoon Erich"
In the evening the does it again: "Good evening Sun".
Silence
He says again: "Good evening Sun
From a distance he hears a shout: "Go fuck yourself I'm in the west
I follow Visegrad Group politics and then Germany and France
Was interested also in british when brexit was a hot topic but recently i do not care anymore
I like to observe politics of the Union
Union should stand together, more now than ever
Slovak inperialism at it's best
In Slovakia I would say Tribeč hills
A lot of anomalies are happening there and a lot of people went missing in these hills
It is believed to be interwoven with caves under whole complex
There is even book and a movie about it, called [the Rift] One of the better slovak horrors
The It monster would like to have a word
Where is it
I just read something about that and pit it on my to go list of Czech rep
Very popular
Not rare to see 15 year olds drinking
In the parliament:
- OĽanO: no specifically defined political direction, it's an anti-corruption party
Although, most members are conservatives, but you can also find some liberals and ultra conservatives
Members are expected to vote independently based on their believes
Many are very conservative and overly religious
- Sme Rodina: right-wing conservatives, quite populistic
Promise a lot of money (and rental apartments) to people with no specific plans to collect that money for
- SaS: right-wing liberals, pretty much consistent with their supposed ideology, less beaurocracy, a lot of support for economics
- Za Ľudí: basically liberal (center maybe
- Smer - SD: absolute populists, act like left-wing conservatives, but are relatively liberal, absolute populists
Defrauded like 40 billion € (I am not exaggerating)
- Hlas - SD: Smer - SD, but on a power trip
- Kotleba - ĽSNS: literal nazis, antisemitic speeches in the parliament, protests when the president gave awards to Jewish people (only criticism regarding Jews), previous party got shut down because of nazi symbolism, leader has used nazi symbolism repeatedly (run a shop with 8
8% discounts if you buy stuff above 1888 crowns, old currency, gave 1488€ to a family as charity "randomly")
Outside of the parliamet, but important:
Progresívne Slovensko: left-wing progressives
SNS: conservative right-wing populists who defrauded a lot of things
All leaders were basically retards
Most-Híd: catering to Hungarians, did a lot of shit with travel department
Spolu: center-right
Dying of salmonela
Dead, caught Hep C after birth in the hospital
At the same time, I probably wouldn't be born in a hospital back then where I would catch Hep C. But dead anyway because I had a lung infection like 3 times while a child
&#x200B;
If health is out of the equation, then I would probably be smuggling stuff across the Austrian - Hungarian border, as I was born in a town notorious for it, lying at the border of Slovakia (then part of Hungary) and Austria
Despite them being a one entity, tariffs had to be paid
I would probably drown in the Morava river while smuggling
Alternatively, getting shanked on my way from work, since crime was high as fuck back then
Become a part of bernolakovcov and become a writer and make really hard to read to understand poetry just to make it harder for students 200 years later
Given who were my ancestors at that time, I would be either a farmer, a miller (a better alternative), or something in a developing multiethnic mining settlement, probably a charcoal burner
As a male, I could be at least literate, but still probably poor
I would get married in my 20s with a girl from a nearby village and have many children (half of them would die early)
I wouldn't move far from my ancestral village during my life (if I weren't a newcomer to the mentioned mining settlement) and I could expect an epidemic of cholera 12 years later
I am totaly pro Taiwan
Sorry REPUBLIC OF CHINA (true one)
RC invest 3 or 4 times to Slovakia more than PRC (people's Republic of China)
Thay didn't violates people rights like PRC with uyghurs, and thay don't support a African dictators
Thay didn't polute so much
And mainly they didn't threaten us of embargoes exc
I don't says that RC is perfect, But I'more for slovakia lean closer to RC
Yes Taiwan is an independent country and we love to have some more cooperation with them
Plus we already know commies bad
Santa doesn't bring presents here in Slovakia
Instead, baby Jesus does, whom you can imagine where he lives
Nikolaus (Mikuláš) here comes with čert (sort of a demon, from hell), which takes little naughty kids in his bag, and Angel, who gives good kids chocolate
Needless to say, I was scared as hell by Čert when I was kid
Yes and Slovakia and Czech Republic, too
Austro-hungarian heritage ftw
It's literally just baby jesus, or rather, his form is not specified to kids
Most of our families are christian so kids are familiar with the story of Jesus
When I was kid he also got us Christmas tree, which to this day I'm not sure how "he" pulled that one off
as someone from slovakia
that’s actually almost exactly how I imagined it as a kid lmao I found it scary but I never really questioned it
No, Jesus is sitting on the right of God, as his right hand
Maybe it's because some parts of Małopolska were influenced largely by Czechs and Slovaks before (Habsburghs, especially the mountainous parts)
Also according to internet "starman" is old dude prominent in the west of poland, not in the south
Čert is basically Krampus, but doesn't come at Christmas, rather at 6
December
Also Čert is a slavic mythology creature I believe
So it's kind of weird seeing him alongside Christian myths
He's got a tumor it's not nice to talk about it
Slovak National Security Authority (NBU - Národný Bezpečnostný Úrad) having nbusr / nbusr123 as login and password
Got hacked
I like how it looks :P
You can choose between religion and ethics classes
Tell him that in Italy, it is customary to eat spaghetti by hands only, and rude using a fork
Tell him that in Italy, one must ask for ketchup on a pizza
Tell him that just like in the Eurotrip movie, he'll be considered to be a billionaire if he waves a single American dollar around in Slovakia
Tell him that just like in another bad movie, he should be vary of hot Slovak girls, as they'll likely want lure him to a non public place and have enslaved / murdered
Tell him that in Prague, it's common to ask random women on the street if they want to have sex for a few bucks and be filmed while at it
If he doesn't believe it, show him some proof #Publicagent
Tell him that when he goes through the passport control upon arriving to Europe, it is alright if he hands in his driving license instead of the passport
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
Vienna
Because then we would be ruled by people, who actually understand how to govern a state
Nitra, it's pretty large (for Slovak standards), and was the capital of the first Slavic state in modern-day Slovakia, the Principality of Nitra
Unfortunately, considering its old town was almost completely destroyed by the communist do
you get the idea, I'd go with Košice, a beautiful city, the second largest in Slovakia (with a population of 250,000, compared to the 450,000 of Bratislava)
It also has the coolest Slovak cathedral
I would actually propose Nitra, it used to be the seat of dukes
Plus it’s really nice, my personal favourite
Too bad they couldn't govern a country in 19th/20th centuries, too bad
C'mon man, everybody knows Brno is not a real thing
I, for one, suggest moving the capital to the great city of Jihlava
Phew, I thought you were going to choose Bratislava xd
Esztergom is a beautiful town
This is the way
How about you take Slovakia instead of Czechia and connect Vienna and Bratislava to make a megapolis central to the country
We'd also finally get rid of the shitshow that's our politics
Poldark intensifies
I don't know, the name reminds me of a certain Serbo-Croatian profanity too much
Let's make a West Slavic federation and have the capital be Wroclaw/Vratislav, as it was an important town both to the Czechs and the Poles a long time ago
And is about as far away from the centre of the country as it can be
A really stupid choice, we Slovaks know why
Grodno is beautiful, how about that one
Slovakia, where the capital is at the border, right next to Austria's capital: *I don't have such weaknesses*
Or Bratislava
Where my Olomouc gang at
Wait, Turin is the Italian name
I always thought the way we say it, Turín, is a complete Slovakization, as it sounds like it could just be the name of a small village in the mountains of Central Slovakia, maybe in Turiec
Does it have some history as the capital like Bratislava
Or is it just kinda central to the old borders
>Capitals work better when they are in the center of the country, making everything more connected
Sad Slovak noises
Wait, so Turin is the English name
The assembly line basically
Whole economy based around car production
Is this Slovakia
Oh wait ...
we would notice
I love that you stayed in EU, I hope it will show in the future, that it was the right move
People need to stand united to achieve great things
Also the flag is big plus
I do not think so
Very often you see in the news that Macron says this or Macron says that
He says a lot of things, but most of them are not taken seriously here in the east of EU
Everybody here just waits for what Mutti's response will be
No, you mean Chechnya
Americans would receive the news and bring the whole army to Bratislava to save you
No that's Chille
No, wherever you go to doctor they take you inn, diagnose you and send you on your merry way, no questions asked, no money paid
I cannot imagine living any different than this, beeing scared of visiting doctor with injury and shit
We have the same system as Germany, also the % are same or very simmilar, and i tought for a long time that every country in EU has it like that
Ingliš lenguidž. Bikóz of speling
Euskara, such a crazy language, but i really want to learn it lol
One hungary to the north
I agree with you
For some reason we learn very little about the Spanish Civil War and the subsequent Franco regime in our high schools
I’ve got to know more about it only because of having a Spanish boyfriend
I read a lot when it comes to history, but there are some things I don't know much about
UK : Anglo-Saxon invasion
Greece : Anything after fall of Byzantine Empire
Baltic states : I know only about Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth
But why is there the flag of Finland (?) strapped to the bicycle
Czechs and Austrians are Germans now apparently
Well, in any case, Slovaks don't wear socks and sandals, so we're safe
High Tatras and Bratislava probably
I cannot think of any other places that would receive lots of tourists (maybe other mountains or castles across the country)
Bratislava city centre and High Tatras, undoubtedly
Bratislava for foreigners, it's a usually just a stop between other Central European capitals, so they think they've seen Slovakia
High Tatras for Czech and Slovak tourists
Right now there are literal traffic jams in the hiking trails
I know about alabama and new york and texas, and florida maan ... and sydney
no wait thats different continent
Well those are it then
Ah yes, detachable prefixes
And yet it's easy for a Hungarian to learn German
I found that the sentences have a similar structure, as opposed to say, from Slovak to German
Yeah, I love the food and safety standards, most people take it for granted
Hell yeah
I love EU projects, huge fan or Erasmus and Erasmus plus and I just like that we are friends now
I want to try living in as much countries as possible and EU helps me in that
I don't think I know such people personally, but antivax and all sorts homeopathy (or bleach solutions and that BS) is getting popular especially on social medias
Then there is this "Brussels' dictate" thing, but I'm not sure it's "government don't want you to know" thing since some parties even within our government really like to use this one
Anything unpopular is basically called out as "Brussels' dictate" a.k.a. "the EU forced us to do that" and everything popular is "our government fought hard to achieve this". It's especially super weird to hear this sentiment from the party which is still a member of eurosocialists and their nominee is a vice-president of the EU commission
//edit: oh I forgot one thing
There is also quite a strong Russian influence
So all sorts of bullshit like that Egyptian pharaohs were Slavic
That there was some mummy of a Slavic beauty found in Russia dated a million years back
That there is a huge conspiracy of Germanic people to destroy or enslave Slavs within the EU and that the Russia is the only solution
I can't believe people actually believe that bullshit after what Russians did to us in 1968
When I need something my go-to is English one
But when I’m just interested in something I prefer Slovak or Czech one, because sometimes I’m lazy to read in English and translate words I don’t know xD
Absolute tragedy unreadable by anyone who has ever seen a usable wiki
If you don’t speak English, just read Czech wiki
Is drinking tap water normal it your country
If not, why
Yes very normal
In some places and especially young people its frowned upon to buy bottled water
I always ask for tap water in restaurants, because I dislike sugary sodas
Plus you can always ask them to add lemon or make a lemonade
The homemade lemonades are really popular jn Bratislava and cities
Plus the water in my hometown is delicious
Mountains
You can drink the water from toilet here, since we flush with drinking water aswell
Very abundand underground reservoirs of drinking water at Slovakia
Slovak government is just one big circus
Not worth even talking about it - corruption rate is high
Also if you have a lot of acquaintances you can literally bribe anyone and be well off
I have a hard time not seeing a stag in Prague
You were lucky
They really annoy me too
If they immigrate to the country no problem, I know some, but the pub crawls parties are the worst
They piss everywhere, climb on monuments, wear stupid things, are really loud and somehow think they can pick up girls
Yep
Still a holiday, so if the flirting goes wrong, you will never see them again
And thats a plus
I knew about every single one of them, even approximate locations for some reason(i'm not boasting I just happened to know all)
Just don't try it it's hard
Lactose **tolerance
** Europeans have the lowest lactose intolerance rates in the world
Europeans are also quite cheesy people, every country produces and consumes their own type of cheese
when your room is messy - "it's messy in here like inside a tank"
when the air is stale - "it smells in here like Tsarigrad (an archaic name of Istanbul)"
yep, same here heh
Unlike in retarded english, mostly yes
Yes 100% .... we write as we speak and read as it’s written
If I think about it
Yes
If I'm supposed to do it on spot I would struggle
Our letter ľ sounds  awfully similiar to l, and I have trouble with that a lot
Then there are y/i rules which I'm still not sure if I understand
There are chosen words in which there is Y instead of I even tho it's breaking rules
Then there are other chosen words which are not included in chosen words, because they are not chosen, but somehow are written different in different meaning (psi/psy for example
Both of those words are meant to be dogs, but both of them are right if certain requirements are met)
And lastly, there is insanely low percentage of people speaking pure slovak
Most of people are speaking with heavy dialect to the point where I don't really understand them
100% of the time, as all are spelt phonetically, except for basic grammar rules, which are usually looked over anyway
Some people say that Slovak is the Slavic Esperanto which is kind of true prehaps but not when it comes to writing things down
You nailed it in my opinion
Still not perfect but the best writing system among Slavic languages and one of the best among all languages in the world
I envy you the lack of i/y problem in Serbian
In Slovak this is a nightmare
Even adults make mistakes with pekný muži instead of pekní muži. It should be all written with i. And y should be used only in foreign words
Also why ä? It  should be peť, meso instead of the weird päť, mäso
However, one thing I like about Slovak and Czech is the marking of long and short vowels e.g. a and á. It's better than in Finish even because you can do things like praária which in Finish would be praaaria but the problem that arises is that you don't know which two are long the first two or the last two A's ? Does praaaria sound like práaria or praária
I am Slovak and the written Russian is extremely hard for me
Bulgarian, while still hard because of Cyrillic, it is easier and more phonetic and easier to remember for some reason than Russian
Russian seems to have more exceptions as well
No, in Czech and Slovak those are pronounced the same as i. For comedic effect you can pronounce it more like your y = more like the German ü but that's it
mal**ý** muž (small man) and mal**í** muži (small men) = here both ý and í sound the same
The toilet in Slovak has the best euphemism
We call it "Press Conference" (tlačová porada/shortly it's tlačovka)
In slovak: “čučoriedka” and “kôstka” (blueberry, bone)
I like words like “zmrzlina” or the czech “čtvrtsmršť” because some people apparently freak out when they see long streak of consonants without vowels
I think that řeřicha is more common
I'll do you one better
Ľalia
>Te tetted e tettetett tettet, te tettetett tettek tettese, te
This is the sound of train moving on rails with gaps
There are slang words words like "kámo" (mate) and "brácho" (bro)
But I haven't seen them being used too much, but that might be because I am getting old
We usually just refer to each others by their name
There is a well carved deep into the rock that the castle of Trenčín is built on, allegedly by a Turkish nobleman named Omar, in exchange for the release of his fianceé Fatimah from captivity
Also, the famous chess-playing automaton devised by Wolfgang Kepmelen in Bratislava in the 18th century is rumored only to be a hollow doll, secretly "housing" a Turkish amputee, who was very good at chess
Except for the New Year's eve nothing, but I wonder if any Norwegians have considered celebrating the 8th of May with fireworks, in undying memory of Josef Terboven's spectacular way of departure
officialy it's only New year's eve, but some people do it also on Christmas
Fireworks are allowed only 1 hour on new years
Rest of the year its against the law to fire them on the whole territory
It happens from time to time of course, but its not allowed
For those too lazy to read wikipedia: Norwegian nazi who blew himself up with 50kg of dynamite
Also the islands are self governing and even tho their citizens have EU passports and can live in any EÚ country, it does not apply both ways
Some regulations since not all of EU can fit onto Canary Islands
Huh ... so I can go to canary and stay there forever and ever ... huh ... welp t´was boring life here anyway
During WWI, when Czechoslovakia was just forming, we successfully defeated Russia in a naval battle, despite being a ladlocked country and having no navy
Czechoslovak troops in Siberia seized a military vessel on the lake Baikal and used it to sink another military vessel
Also, they took control of the Transsiberian railway for a couple of weeks, effectively conquering half of Russian territory
Cool but do you mean Buda or Pest
Slovakia has the highest number of castles per person
Whaaat, do people in Norway still know how to wash dishes manually
I'd expect you Scandinavians to only use dishwashers with closed circut of water, powered by biomass generated from food leftovers from the previous run
I guess you can call it an improvised military vessel
Nah, you know, just chillin'...
But seriously, [here] a quick introduction
Just Байкал.
Although on my second thoughts, that wouldn't be carbon neutral, still
Curiously, taxonomy is the only part of Czech and Slovak vocabulary, where adjectives come after nouns, as it is habitual in Polish
So you don't really have to swap them, but I suppose it sounds even funnier to you that way, which is the point
We had those as well during socialism, my grandma used to be one
She hasn't told me much about it, except that it was required of her and her fellow pioneers to attend public festivities and street marches celebrating socialism and the government
She was also one of the pioneers who carried the flag in a parade when Fidel Castro visited Slovakia in June of 1972 and was hosted in Nitra (one of the largest and oldest cities in Slovakia)
She said she had liked being a pioneer, but also said the constant marching in the streets of Nitra was really tiring for her (they would often march for hours while carrying flags)
I live in a city in Slovakia, that's built on old Roman outpost called Laugaricio
There is some roman writing on the wall of the rock upon which the medieval lords of this area build a beautiful castle
Before Romans, there were Celts here, as well
Fun fact; The opening battle in Gladiator took place here and the writing on the wall was written to celebrate it
Never
Packages are either delivered by courier and signed off, handed over at post with identification, or if you want at a shop which participates in 'zásielkovňa' in which case you get a special code
I never understood why packages in USA get left at the doorstep
You would think that because most people order from Amazon and such it would be more secure
Ah, Amazon
I wonder when was the last time I read something good about amazon, especially concerning their workers
Sofia, the whole city is one street with shops and commie blocks
Well come to Svit in Slovakia
Basically commies build it to house people who worked in factories there
It's terrible
It has no soul
Well maybe old non existent commie soul
Sofia is the twin city of Bratislava, lol
Can relate
I agree
We should definitely bulldoze down the parliament
The building is shit, and so are its residents
"d" in the word "zmrd" is pronounced as "t"
šukať is slovak
šukat is czech
The university tuition is mostly free in Slovakia
The main issue is that the overall education level is really bad
Teachers are, quite often, uneducated, cheating is common
Having a Master’s degree there is no big deal
The biggest idiots have 2 or more
Studying is free of charge for most of the common cases
Basically you got two ways in which you can study - daily (attending courses every day) or distant (getting materials, self studying it, having courses once in a while e.g. during weekend)
Distant form is paid
Daily form is free if taught in official (Slovak) or minority language
If it's taught in foreign language (e.g. English) it's usually always paid
I think there is an exception in case that study program is not offered in official language on any other university, but for simplicity, studying in foreign language is almost always paid
Then there is this thing with regular length of study for daily
For bachelor degree it's usually 3 years, for masters it's two years and there are some exceptions for some specific study programs e.g. medicine (where it is 5 or 6 years)
Anyway, studying withing regular length is completely free
If exceeding the regular length it's about 600€ per whole school year
You can ask the university to decrease or completely forgive this fee one time if you got a good reason for extension
E.g. I studied abroad one year and I extended my study period by 1 year because of it, the fee was completely forgiven by the university
TL;DR: Studying in Slovakia is free if you study a program taught in official national or minority language and you don't exceed the regular length of study for your program
//edit: maybe I should add there are some other costs associated with studying
E.g. getting your university card (entitling you to free travels by trains within Slovakia and several other discounts)
Those are usually very low
Then there is cost for dormitory or renting a private room (unless your parents live close to the university so you can stay with them)
Dormitory is usually pretty cheap, somewhere between 50-100€ per month
As a foreigner you'll usually have no problem getting one
Maybe with exception of studying in Bratislava since amount of students exceed the dormitory capacity a lot
If you come from low income families you can apply for social stipendium
Part of it is fully covering the dormitory costs (but not private room/house renting)
Then there is costs associated with food
Food is generally cheap in Slovakia and even cheaper at school canteen since it's partially funded by university/government
In my times (about 5 years ago) it was about 1
50€~2€ per meal
Below 1€ for breakfast meal
Ďalekohľad - Telescope - Far Sight
Almost same in Slovak language
Ahoj, volám sa Ján. Rád ťa spoznávam
Odkiaľ si
Hi, called John
Glad you knowing
Where from are
Alternatively, you could go for a more literal translation
Ahoj, moje meno je Ján. Je mi potešením ťa stretnúť. Odkiaľ si ty
Hi, my name is John
Is me pleasure you meet
Where from are you
Ahoj , moje meno je Ján. Rád ťa spoznávam
Odkiaľ si ?
Hi, my name is John
I pleasure you meet
Where you from
So they finally found the hot singles in the area ?

The one with executive power is Prime Minister who basically govern the country as the leader of praliament/government
President as written below is supposed to be less controversial figure, who keep nation united (because PM can be quite polarized person for obvious politicial bias), also as written below, there are expectations that government can change and president should stay (even has longer serving period)
Also president has mostly representative function, but has some power, her/she is the highest chief of army, can veto law, gives amnesties, names judges etc
In slovakia this works pretty much like magic
Our PMs were mostly controversial trough all the modern history, and our presidents were less polarized persons who kept them in check
Especially the last two presidents, it we had different ones, we would be most likely on the same route Poland and Hungary are at the very moment
>someone less controversial, who isn't an active member of a particular political party and gives the people a sense of unity and wisdom (at least in theory)
Made me gigle thinking of your president
That is quite interesting, because we have direct presidential elections since forever and we always managed to pick up someone okayish
How was it before the direct elections, who used to pick up the president
That seems also dangerous, if one party has too much power in government, they can just choose "their guy"
Because for example over here, president stops those ridiculous proposals etc
If one group control government and president office, they have unlimited power basically
There were few such attempts in slovakia, and people always voted for the "second worse", even the last presidential election were on that route, if the other candidate won, we would have very different political situation over here and we will be there with poland and hungary
We celebrete it, but most of the people don't notice
I think that the biggest cause is that fo many decades we celebrated 9th of May as end of the WW2 (commonly accepted date is 8th May, when Nazi Germany surrendered and allies liberated Prague)
But Soviet powers marched to Prague a day later
Also according to [Wikipedia] when Germany surrendered in the evening of May 8th, it was May 9th of Moscow time already
And thus all of the Eastern block adopted the latter date
Edit: I forgot to mention that we reverted back to 8th of May, but many older people can't really accept it (and I don't blame them, I would probably do the same in that age
And Košice (secont biggest city by pop
) celebrate the town status given to them on 9
1369
(I just found out that because of this Europe's day is celebrated in Košice on [6th of May] don't ask me why)
(Pls correct me if the facts are wrong)
Jesus Christ, no
Showing how "European" you are is cringey

The Shop on Main Street
The Line
Lóve
These are the ones I like the most
Únos (2017)
Trhlina (2019)
Though these will be difficult to watch without knowledge of our country
Ja, Oľga Hepnarová (2016) is good, but that is a French-Czech-Polish-Slovak coproduction
The shop on main street
Won an Oscar
I would go with Pacho Hýbsky zbojník.
OP is polish so they probably know enough about the good highwayman archetype, especially Jánošík. The movie is a gem, but it does rely heavily on knowledge of the highwayman stories
Poland is suspiciously quiet
Slovak Parliament
Some of them are alien
They claim having no such list, it is all conspiracy theorist
Just not in the winter
I can see how ukraine would be way more welcoming
I like this about europeans a lot
In US for comment like this, people would be apologizing in morning tv show
I had to google it up, and found out independence day in poland (and the us tv show was meant for my comment about quiet poland)
In Poland
Again
I really like our president so I wouldn’t change her
Our PM is not much, but he’s better than last two PMs
I would change him for Iceland’s or New Zealand’s prime minister
Our president is the most trusted politician here so I wouldn't change her
Our PM tho
well, better than the current opposition but still leaves a lot to be desired
I've been hearing only good things about  Jacinda Ardern (NZ PM), can some kiwis confirm, or is she a lizard in disguise
Čaputova forever
Wouldn’t the independence of Northern Ireland help with this
From what I know about Duda
BoJo is actually an improvement
He is still the corrupt narcissistic opportunist like Duda, but at least he is not as big on LGBT suppression nor on abortion bans
But then isn’t it worse to be stuck in this state in between
In Slovak, you can tell quite a lot with a simple “noo…”
[as you can see in this post]
no ani som si neuvedomil že no ma toľko významov lol
haha i would be able to pronounce it
Nooo, hej no
same as "*okej*" in Slovak, and also similar with more positive connotation of it
We exist
"Yes, we were separated
My country didn’t exist in 1919 yet haha so idk how to answer
Probably the forming [new Bratislava downtown] Probably contrary to what most people from the west picture (if they picture anything at all), Bratislava is becoming a very modern city, with plenty of new high-rise buildings and well developed infrastructure
Our translators often add the suffix -ová to female surnames, which makes them sound very weird, at least in my opinion
Also a lot of them translate word-to-word, which can result in really bizarre translations (especially when it comes idioms or proverbs)
For example Bilbo Baggins was translated in the first Slovak version of The Hobbit as Bilbo Lazník (lazy is the name for very small villages in mountains with scattered houses in certain parts of Slovakia), and in the second translation his surname was changed to Bublík (really can't find the connection between Bublík and Baggins, since Bublík sounds like something related to bubbles or some shit)
Our translation of Harry Potter is quite infamous and is regarded by many to be of a poor quality
The translator changed the names of the founders of Hogwarts (Godric Gryffindor is suddenly Richard Chrabromil, Rowena Ravenclaw is Brunhilda Bystrohlavová, Helga Hufflepuff is Brigita Bifľomorová, only Salazar stayed the same) and translated Hogwarts to Rokfort, instead of Bradavice
You should check out the Czech translation for Harry Potter, it is interesting at the least
What was in the Czech translation of ASOIAF
Any weird name changes
But to be fair, I love Czech translation of Lort but with Harry Potter was I was alway torn, because Bradavice didn't go well with me
Brumbal is all and well, but it just doesn't pack punch as Dumbledore
And yes I know Brumbal is also some thing as Dumbledore, so not a bad job
I just always lived how long his name was
I felt like in context of English language and their often weird names as Liverpool it kinda makes sense, but with Bradavice, that's medical condition
But then again what you expect when someone names a school Hogwarts
The translator must have been freaking out
But all the fame and splendour comes to your translation of Terry Pratchett books
That must be a freaking hard job
New Czech translations of ASOIAF feature the sin of adding suffix -ová to female surnames, like Daenerys Targaryenová or Cersei Lannisterová.
I liked ours as well
Both of them did a great job
However didn't really care about names as much as a kid, because if you translated one then you have to do all, and Harry Potter too
To me as a kid were just names
I just personally found Bradavice weird
So I am glad we went Rokfort way too
It gave you the Oxford school name vibe
It looks weird AF, since every single ASOIAF name is too 'foreign-sounding' for it not to look weird
Older translations of the books in Czech don't contain the suffix -ová, but I suspect that the Slovak translation of ASOIAF is to be blamed, since it was the first one to use it

Because swearing in English kinda doesn't feel like swearing
Its just another language
But hoho if you hear me swear in ma native language, you bet I am pissed
Also makes me feel a bit - ups I said a bad word whereas in english its fuck fuck cunt whatever, just foreign language
Hahahahaha I wish
You could say that Bratislava is kinda hated by it's own citizens
So maybe that counts
Never heard that in my life, personally I love my city
2011 - Over sending financial aid to Greece (although that was more like the last straw, the coalition was incredily wobbly from the get go)
2018 - More like a controlled PM swap from Fico to Pellegrini
For young people yes
If there is someone on 20-30 and doesnt understand english at all, it is strange, at least as far as i know
You have to take an exam from a foreign language (B1 or B2 usually) in order to graduate from high school

Dont touch shit that aint yours, thats a common sense aint it
Marián Kotleba
He is a leader of a nationalist political party, and it would be just really hilarious if he got sent to Hungary
No thx, we've got plenty of shitty politicians already
Maybe the Poles or the Hungarians would be interested
Would you be interested in more of our exports
Robert Fico
Marian Kotleba, perhaps
Look how liked Babis is there, we can guarantee the best quality of corruption

Pls no
the name must be in some kind of name database
as there is a proof that it exists as a given name
if the name has only one version, ti can be given for both boys and girls, if the name has feminine and masculine version, they must be given accordingly to boys and girls
fun fact: Daenerys is a version of ancient greek name
I suppose it is Deianira
Elektra and Thor are also ancient mythical names
and the mystery is solved
we have nicknames allowed as first name, too
if they exist as given name as well
so Ella, Elena, Elia and Elaria, Eleonora, Elinor are O.K.
some parents switch to hungarian
if kids know better or only slovak
or slovak
if they know better or only hungarian
my great-grandparents used hungarian to argue
they weren´t hungarian
as some other people already wrote here, it's super nice of them if they can actually carry on a conversation (even a simple one), but it's super annoying if they can only say a few words and push it and then you don't understand each other at all, like the types that walk around with a phrasebook and just read stuff from there, mispronounce everything (obviously) and you have no idea what they're trying to say, which wouldn't be a problem if they spoke English instead
Depends who and how
Especially Americans tend to butcher our language in ways we have absolutely zero idea what they’re saying
But from the other side whenever I vacation in southern Europe (Spain, Italy, Croatia, Bulgaria) and try to speak their languages people seem to be genuinely happy
If they can do it at a comprehensible level, I'd be very impressed since it has a very steep learning curve
I’ve studied French for 6 years in high school
When I went to Paris I’ve tried speaking French couple of times, people understood me and replied in french and I couldn’t understood a word they were saying
Do you actually dislike each other
I always thought we three just make fun of each other's bullshit
I am surprised I didn't find a comment from a Bulgarian, which would say rose extract
Anyway, I have no idea what my country would smell of
Maybe no smell at all is it most significant trait, just fresh mountain air
Hahah, honesty at first place I see
Where were you
When I opened this section I thought this answer for Bulgaria would be in the top 5
I thought of mountain fresh air too
I asked my family and they said mountain air as well, but also mentioned the smell of sheep or cattle
If I may interfere I would pick thyme for you instead
I have oregano associated rather with Italy
Oh yes, sheep fleece would be a great pick too
Unbearably
^Don't ^bother, ^I'll ^show ^myself ^out
During my life I've often visited two towns where the population is decreasing rapidly (about 15 % in 20 years)
The decrease is surprisingly invisible - new houses, shops and facilities have been built during these years, they don't seem to be in decline overall
Bulgaria lost around 2 mil people since  fall of communism
That is sad
This is true
It happens from time to time that some smuggling tunnel is discovered on Slovak-Ukrainian border
Or some drone is spotted and so on
Sometimes people try to smuggle cigarettes in some hidden compartments of their car but due to Schengen the border is heavily monitored
Anyway, some cigarettes still get through
Another thing is that weed is relatively safe drug
If that one is out of the game they might move on something more dangerous
Mafia won't die out just because some part of their business is gone
They'll adapt
This sounds silly, but as a little kid I believed that the coast of any seaside country looks like the edge of a swimming pool with a ladder leading down to the sea
I was confused when I first saw a sand beach in Italy and then I when I got back home from the vacation I was telling my friends how Italy has a sand playground leading to the sea unlike other countries and that is the reason why people vacation in Italy so they can play on their sand playgrounds with water
My route of choosing would be
Valencia - Nice - Venice - Prague - Košice
Because why not
I have no idea why but I always end up dating austrian girls
We tend to click easily and we share somewhat a dark sense of humor
Dont tell anyone
Not really
Mostly, the only generation we refer to are Gustav Husák's children, which are essentially baby boomers, nothing else besides that
Conjunctions mostly (mostly probably entirely)
It is
But I personally never had a problem, saying how much I get payed, when someone asks
That being said, so far I only worked part-time and had hourly salary, so I dont know how I would feel about discussing my static monthly salary, but I think I would still be comfortable with it, if somebody asked
I would say the green ones
The black ones are mostly found in salads, on pizza, but green ones are popular also being filled with something (almonds, tomato paste
) and eaten as a snack
You can get both, but I’d say people prefer green  olives
For a nation that didnt exist on the map for 1000 years we have an interesting language history
Our language started as Proto-Slavic common with other Slavic nations
As a written language however, Slovak started in Great Moravia in the 9th century when Cyril and Methodius invented the glagolic alphabet , from this period you can google st
Gorazd prayer, despite being a millenia old, it is somewhat understandable
( some sentences make sense completely, other have strange words, others are completely strange)
Eventually Glagolic got replaced with Latin alphabet and language, followers of Cyril and Methodius fled to the east where they invented Cyrilic which is still used today
Slovak during medieval age developed rather slowly , as it was overshadowed by latin and hungarian
In the 14th century Czech language made its way to Slovakia (northern Hungary back then) and Slovakized Czech became a thing which paved way for the similarities between Slovak and Czech that we know today
Fastforward to 19th century, we have Slovak national awakening with many writers who improved the Slovak language to more or less the form that we have now
And lastly , when Czechoslovakia formed in 1918, putting Slovakia(kinda) on the map after 1000 years , we started "crossing out" words that came from German and Hungarian and replacing them with Czech and Polish words (so that they sound more Slavic) . And thats the language we have today
Generally for an average Slovak speaker, every version of "Slovak" is to some extend understandable, of course the further into history you go the harder it gets, but that applies to every language
thanks for this great summary, I wouldn’t write it better
interesting fact: after inventing glagolic and translating Bible to it, this old Slavonic was accepted as the fourth liturgical language,
Great Moravia gained bishop and church there wasn’t controlled by Frank bishops (for a while)
Non-native English speakers, what is the most typical calque your countrymen incorrectly use, when they speak English
For example, the word for door is always plural in Slovak and you can often hear Slovaks say they "opened the doors" or so, even though they mean just one door
As a fellow Slovak, I struggle with Slovak cities with names in plural - Košice, Michalovce, etc
I tend to say “Košice are the second biggest city in Slovakia”, as I would in Slovak, rather than Košice is
Also watch / watches (always plural in Slovak)
I myself, a Slovak, have still problems using 'dress' as a singular, since in Slovak it's plural
And 'hair' sometimes too
IDK why but I often notice (and get annoyed by) pronunciation errors more than small grammar mistakes
Like most people around here (Slovakia and neighboring countries) can’t pronounce english V and R properly
And French people can’t pronounce H and U.
Im just imagining a blonde blue eyed Joe Pesci with a Swedish accent sitting on an ikea chair eating meatballs: "Funny how
Funny like I'm a clown
Like am I here to amuse you
Skrattar du vorlarar du
Oh lord, no more shootings in Austria, please
But I think you can use police in singular too, when you rather mean the whole organization, can't you
Russians very thrifty with the verb "to be", too
> one letter corresponds to — gasp
— one sound
Oh really
How many times do I have to tell Poles to learn to use š,č and ř, because half of the letters they write, namely z-s, are simply **not there**!
I meant that I would probably say "Police exist*s* to maintain law and order
" Would it be too weird
Nope
Does the "sz" in "Nos Zbigniewa" sound to you as the "sz" in Bydgoszcz
Maybe it is native English speakers, who should get it right
But the word "actually" is so flexible and ellegant, we should just adopt it
We should totally start a petition
And they should switch to "ananas", "beton" and "gepard" too
Regardless, English marks the same sound as "sh". How does "h" equal to "z", then
In Slovakia it is mandatory to have an ID card - [Slovak ID] \- once you are 15 years old
Originally I thought that EU countires would have some norm at least in design, but obviously not (however, this applies to [driving licences] and passports)
Since 2013, version equipped with electrinic chip is provided, so communication with government or your city can be done online (like taxes, request for car registration, changes in marital status, etc)
It is heavily used in every contact with government, banking, municipalities, employers and so on (e.g. if stopped by police while driving, if you'd like to request a price reduction for travelling, if signing a contract with telecom operators, or if renting a flat)
In special cases, passport can be used as verification
Nothing extraordinary is listed there besides standard info (where/when born, address), but you can add some remarks, such as academic title, blood type or serious medical conditions
Vienna, Vienna, Vienna, Vienna, Bratislava
We were Austria-Hungary until 1st world war
Then until 1993, Prague was the biggest city in Czechoslovakia
Since independence in 1993, Bratislava is our biggest city and capital
Second would be Košice, then Prešov
Kutná Hora was a very close second until the 16th century
So elegant
Slovakian superiority shining through in 1600s
Trávnik is lawn in Slovak too:)
The point is it wasn't a relatively small town, in the Middle Ages, it was the second biggest Czech town
Ah, Runescape
I see you're a man of culture as well
I was in Turku, and there was this greek girl (from Tessaloniki I think) who spent the whole time bitching about how cold it was
It was unironically very entertaining
I know a guy from Košice who was studying in Ostrava I think and did Erasmus in Kosice  so he was staying at home and getting paid
But it was years ago, now it's impossible to do Erasmus in your native country
But there are still people doing Erasmus just across borders in Vienna, Krakow or Ostrava
I have 100% success rate recognizing a Finn by his english accent
About that, I had a coworker who looked super Turkish
Despite being 100% small village Slovakian
When they went to Turkey people just kept talking to him as if he was local
He loved it
That's actually pretty useful
Lot of runners use it too
Pretty standard for hiking
Its amazing for joints health
Aka I use them in my thirties, especially for going down because I have iffy knees
“Z Komára Somára” (Turn a mosquito into a donkey) It basically is said when the person you’re talking to is over-exaggerating things
We have mosquito and donkey
In Slovakia we have “Jazykovedný ústav Ľudovíta Štúra” according to google translate: Ľudovít Štúr Institute of Linguistics
Reminds me of how terribly Spanish people must feel when someone is surprised that they can speak Mexican
A song defining slovak culture is [Citim vôňu lesa (borovička song)] ... well, borovička is a typical slovak brandy and there is no household without it + the party beat makes it a perfect party song
For more chilling and moving atmosphere, [Hrdza - Slovensko moje, otčina moja]
And my personal favourite since my childhood: [Kristina - Horehronie] she sings about the central region in Slovakia and defines the typical slovak landscape and nature
I think most viewed is however [Ego - žijeme len raz] which is a summer dance song and is played at almost every party in summer
And as for Romainian metal, Bucovina is just superb
I will add:
[Peter Bič Project - Hey Now] was popular even abroad
[Peter Bič Project - Where Did You Go] with a new singer
Another one by [Hrdza - Košieľočka]
[The Bridgeheads - Fire]
[Bad Karma Boy - Dunaj]
[Tublatanka - Spálená láska]
Not at all, which is a shame because there are many accents to choose from
What I can remember is cooperation between some Czech and Slovak studios when dubbing Alvin and Chipmunks, where some characters were Czech and some Slovak
I believe the dubbing was the best part of the movie
Almost every region has it's own accent
But generaly slovaks divide the Slovak language into 3 sub groups: Western Slovak, Central Slovak and Eastern Slovak
And for each one, the other one sounds funny
Yes
Despite being small country, we are divided into many dialect groups
However, they seem to slowly disappear, because younger generations speak mostly standardized language taught in schools
(but no one speak that soft as it should be, only Slovaks in middle of Slovakia , and I don’t like it at all :D )
That’s just strange, I mean I get it, but still, it’s a bit strange
Probably Komárno, but I'm not sure
Also Štúrovo/Esztergom, right
Yep Sátoraljaúhely/Slovenské Nové Mesto
That's stupid
It's not even a town, rather a village
Why not give the whole town to Hungary
Honestly, the founders of the country were sometimes just too harsh on Hungary
Komarno ok, makes sense due to the Danube sort of, but this is just laughable
Oh absolutely, the name is stupid
Same goes for Slovakia
That’s actually interesting, do you have a link to this legend
Anyway, I personally, have no problems with Hungarians
In my opinion both sides treated each other unfairly at times and it is good that the revanchism has stopped, however, there is still quite a sizeable amount of, I guess, your far-right countrymen who like to provoke Slovaks in the YouTube comment sections of their own anthem
This, and our history lessons, which totally suck btw and leave out certain facts, are the sole reasons for many young Slovaks’ unfavourable opinions about Hungarians
It’s quite a shame honestly, since our nations have so much in common, it’s just that we kind of disregarded it for the last two centuries
Fascinating read, thank you very much
Yeah like comfy sweatpants and sweatshirts but then i also wear old clothes at home (especially t-shirt that i don’t like anymore)
but i mostly just wear my pj’s when i’m home
[The legendary one]
really creative people live there do they
Bilbao, i want to go there on EURO 2021, even though probably won't, i know that it's quite far future but i doubt that i will go somewhere else until that time lol
If you want to experience Czech culture then visit a smaller Czech city like Znojmo/Mikulov/Plzen/Brno or similar, since Prague is nowadays pretty much just a tourist city like all others
Yes, it is
I was there because I was backpacking around Europe and just got of the flixbus after not sleeping whole night
You know, typical backpack get up plus the give me coffee or I die look
Jeez, I felt so out of place
I generally think I am not a totally ugly person, but there i was super conscious about what was I wearing and how I looked
Everything was so quiet and clean
For some reason my and my friend thought people are staring at us and judging us as we wandered around
I saw a shiny gold car with some arabic plates once when I was in Paris near Champs Elysees
Zavináč - rolled pickled herring(it also means the same as well here)
It’s called zavináč which translates into English as a rollmops
Exactly the same in Slovak
Goes for the fish too
There is also "[závin] a pastry filled and rolled with various stuff (cocoa or poppy seed are common)
I associated more "zavináč" with this
But it's the same root, "zavinúť", "to roll up".
I always cheer for Czechs
Unless we play against each other
And then I will be pro Slovenia, Poland and so
And I love cheering for the underdogs
And that's often us
Unless it's Sagan
In hockey I root for Czechs and for Finland
In football it’s bit different, I just choose anyone who is somehow interesting for me
Last WC I rooted for Belgium
As a Slovak I tend to cheer for Finland in icehockey as we share some traits
Both of us are the "smaller bro" to Czechia and Sweden respectively, we have similar population size, we both feature blie/white jerseys, and we both are pretty good drinkers and just get along well
For me the same
But in hockey I cheer for finns
I like finns
I see how it is
yep, and the other way around as well :)
No worries, I was just joking
Anyway I would cheer for you too
Best wishes neighbours
dont you have to pay for bus
Wouldnt that just slow down the proccess
And East too
Small talk is probably even weirder in Slovakia than in Germany
I can't even imagine random Slovaks stopping me to talk
It only happened to me in London
It was weird, but also kind of refreshing
For real
Brits don't get the memo when travelling abroad, but fights and loud aggressive screeching isn't the norm elsewhere
Like, seriously, the times I've seen British tourists acting worse than Chinese tourists is incredible
Here there are two ways to drink coffee usually
Turkish - where the powder stays in your cup in the end
Nesca - short for Nescafe meaning any instant
Medium to large
The presso thing is funny to us, you expect the same quantity of coffee like you'd get tea, tf am I supposed to do with 1,5 gulps
Dunno why, but I really hit me more In Uk
I lived in Plymouth and the weather was constantly the same
Mizzle and drizzle, windy all the time
Me an my Spanish friends we had to wear coats in summer which was just not right
And the insulation on our house was terrible despite being in one of the really nice parts
It was soo cold inside we used to congregate in the kitchen because we could warm that one up
But then London that's another other thing
It's just much more fun
Even weather was much more fun
It was like living in a different country
Yeah, we're lucky it's lockdown
also r/rimjob_steve
Interesting, in Slovakia, a 90k town would be one of the largest towns in the country, but wherever you go except for the mountains, it's filled with villages and small towns, in every possible direction
Especially some good home-made pálenka, the one thing that unites us all over here
Yep, it's the same here, we just call both "mesto".
Yeah, "city" used to be "hrad" in Slovak, like in all other Slavic languages (grod, gorod
), but for some reason, West Slavs (at least those are the ones I know about) just replaced it with "place" and called it a day
Hrad nowadays means "castle".
Nope
That's if I'm not mistaken a Medieval innovation, just a natural change in languages
Words change meaning
And we never "purged" our language of our own native non-Russian words for no reason, we actually introduced many Russian words for exotic animals and other various things to get rid of German loanwords, so it's the other way around, Czech and Slovak moved closer to Russian and farther away from Romance and Germanic languages in the 19th century in its vocabulary
Yeah, a similar thing to that "hrad" situation happens to Slovaks with Polish, a shit ton of words sound almost the same but have different, sometimes opposite meanings
It's quite confusing lol
Funny ones are "droga", it means "road" in Polish but "drug" in Czech, "šukat" means "to fuck" in Czech but szukać means "to search" in Polish, "zachod" means "west" in Polish but "záchod" means "toilet" in Czech and Slovak
So you can technicelly say "Szukam go na zachodzie" meaning "I'm looking for him in the west", but a Czech or a Slovak will think you're fucking someone on the toilet, as they think it should be translated as "Šukám ho na záchode".
Yeah, Polish is probably closer to Russian than Czech and Slovak are, we're already transitioning into more Germanic-influenced speech (like sounding like robots instead of singing while talking) and Standard Slovak also has many South Slavic features
But still, Polish as a language is much closer to Czech and Slovak than it is to Russian
What was he doing in Irak
Visiting a friend
No, Iran is trying to get a hold of Irak
Maybe you haven't noticed but the leader of Iran is a religious dictator for life that has the last word in everything
Why
Hungary
China is already invading Europe
Surprised nobody mentions that
I guess economical invasion is easily overlooked due to no immediate casualties
That's why it's perhaps even more dangerous
*ahem* H U N G A R Y
(just joking ily Hungary)
Russia or Hungary
these are like classics lol

Sameeee

As a perspective vassals of China, we might
They already debt trapped some balkan countries and got a major influence in several EU countries
EU itself warned member states on that matter
Thinking this is a huge mistake
China has a pretty great control over their middle class, check this short documentary series for examples :) [
Imo, Horkýže Slíže - Váňa z Vorkuty ; Gleb - Motorest
"Ta Ne" by Kristína
It's a song about relationship between western and eastern slovak, (eastern Slovaks speak incredibly different slovak language then rest of slovaks thanks to them being near Ukraine so we often don't know what they are talking about
It's like Irish and English, but far more different) and incredibly catchy song
Szegény vagyok
isn't Váňa z Vorkuty in Russian
I agree with Gleb though, his latest album is great
Yup , it is , but HS are from Slovakia
Btw , how did you get that country tag
But Vana Z Vorkuty is from Bijouterrier :D
I know I know, Kuko is hosting there

In versions from Slovakia he had informal style with a lot of mistakes, mainly when he was writing letters
For instance everything in Slovakia is všetko, je was saying šecko
And placing of words in sentence was not so common
He sounded more like he was from east of the country
For us it’s ťahák, based on the word ťahať-pull
I believe we share it with the Czechs :)
in slovak it's 'ťahák'. it could be translated as 'puller'
Or a sleeve
We would put it in a sleeve and pull it out when the teacher wasn't looking
Haha it’s amazing how Czechia and Slovakia just act like the same country on reddit ️
It depends on school, in primary school each class had a locker room for jacket, shoes, but not for books
In secondary school we had lockers shared by 2-3 students for jacket, shoes and there was also a shelf where we could leave books we didn't need at home
We did in my school but not many schools have them
[ in Slovakia we are using long system like you
The city of Odessa, Ukraine, has a vast and fascinating network of catacombs as well
There are some in Edinburgh too
Both accessible for tourists with a guide
Do you know, by any chance, about any catacombs in Slovakia
Surely there are some beneath several castles
Červený kameň has very impressive ones; some are also beneath the Nitra castle but they are accessible only on special occassions, once or twice a year (btw
Jozef Tiso is buried there, so you can bring a keyboard down there and press F to pay respect, or you can spit on the grave, depending on which side of the political spectre you are leaning towards)
There is some small ossuary below the center of Bratislava, near the Old Market building, but it is also closed for most of the year, and that's pretty much all I know from top of my head
Surely, Google can tell you more
Wow, thanks a lot :)
Most castles per capita ️
Most casualties during WWII
Including from other Soviet Republics, but most were Russian
You were also the most liberal country back during the Soviet era
Yeah, its really tragic, Soviet citizens and the red army payed the highest price to free the world from fascism, we will be forever thankful ️
China is second highest
I struggle to imagine Finns, plural, together in as tight a space as a bus
Would you do it in the subway
When I was in London and went somewhere by bus for the first time, I got pretty confused looks by everyone inside, since I got on the bus through the second door, and not through the front door like everyone else
Then I realized the card reader thing is only next to the driver
so I had to do a walk of shame
Here in Slovakia you can get on the bus using whichever door you want, since the ticket / card devices are placed behind every door
Well, I'm talking about public transportation of a single city
There are machines where you can buy tickets next to all bigger bus-stops
Then you simply get on, "mark" the ticket in the bus and get off
If you have a pass, you simply get on and off whenever and wherever you want
On intercity buses, between for example Bratislava and another city, the only way you can get on is by the front door and you have to buy a ticket off the driver as well
Following your isles discussion as a central European I am like wtf
To be honest this really hits me
Not only because I was a long time Blizzard fan, but I also have friends in the region (mostly in Taiwan tho - the country the two fired casters are from)
I get it that doing business with China became quite an industry standard, but even that should have it's limits and we shouldn't sacrifice our core values to please totalitarian regimes
I also understand that Blizzard has the right to distance themselves from politics and I wouldn't mind if they issue some warning towards the player and make a statement in which they distance themselves from his act or even fine him a bit (deduct some part of prize money in that tournament), but what they did is simply too much
Banning him for a whole year
Taking away all his prize money even from the previous events
And even firing the casters
For a short statement to support of the protesters
Wtf
Company which has an Orc statue at their HQ with writing saying "Every voice matters"? I already uninstalled all their games and the game launcher from my devices
I wasn't just casual free to play player, I spent over 1000€ in past 3 years on their games
So I hope there will be more like me doing the same
I will also follow up with the request to see my personal data they store
According to article 21 of universal human rights, everyone has the Right to Democracy
I see the action done by Blizzard as violation of this
Furthermore, my country suffered quite a lot under communist regime from which we still didn't full recovered and we were even occupied by USSR just because we started to implement democratic reforms back in 1968
So I can understand how people in Hong Kong feel
Therefore, I cannot really continue to support Blizzard and I'll fully support the Hong Kong protesters instead
Yep, I would be okay if they distanced themselves from the player statements, but doing all that to him
That a mark of an authoritarianism, of a government who wants to control and extort their people
Feels totally as a communism move, and I won't ever support that
Big peepee
I think Turkey should be kicked out from NATO and forget about joining EU until they stop to oppress Kurds
They rightfully deserve their own state

How in the world did it even come to this
I mean
at least it rhymes

Sorry, but this is genius
After finishing my Master's degree 3 years ago,  I moved back with my mother to her apartment and started saving up for a house
A year later, my girlfriend of then 4 years (with which I used to live at the college dorm), moved in with us and we're currently in the planning phase of our new house - got the land all paid for, project documentation done and currently working to get mortgage
Probably would have started a year earlier if COVID didn't strike this year
Anyways - we don't openly discuss the details of our sex-life (pretty regular - sometimes a few times a week, sometimes we go a week without), but we're not like pretending not to, even though my family is catholic
Probably helps that my parents are separated and that my mother leaves to spend weekend with my dad at our cottage - so we have the place completely to ourselves at least a couple days per week
I like ours
"Nad Tatrou sa blyska" is a classic
It's basically about how the Slovak nation will rise, while there's a thunderstorm over the Tatra mountains and how the thunder is forcing Slovaks to rise and fight to live
I love thunder part of Slovak anthem but as someone said here , that it's about fighting
That's not true, since only first two parts of song are national anthem
Second thing yes, maybe there is word about taking a sabre and standing in the line, but take it more like stand up for yourself than attack someone
In Slovakia
Can't remember any such words, but mostly because almost every word we use can be "colored" and made to sound childish by adding suffixes in the end
"Strom" (tree) = "Stromček" (lil' tree)
"Jablko" (apple) = "Jabĺčko" (lil' apple)
"Mačka" (cat) = "Mačička" (cute little cat)
And on and on
The suffixes are mainly in form of "-ka" "-čka" "-ko" "-ík" etc
and just make the item smaller or cuter
Vould be applied on names too, something like japanesse "-chan" they add in the end of the names
At least I hope they do it to cutify the name
Example:
"Ján" = "Janko"
"Tomáš" = "Tomáško"
Though, you can't use this (mostly, this language is full of rules that have zillion exceptions) on words that already end with the suffixes in their main form
Thx for reading till here
in Slovak , we have "guľomet" for machine gun, literally translates as bullet/ball thrower
Afaik, it's just some south-east Asian countries which prohibit them
Since our dishes are similar to yours
Its thebest food
I love sweet dishes with poppy
Mmm sulance s makom
Imagine being addicted to placebo
They use cute words for everything
No, it is literally a bottle with big pieces of fruits - [compote] But it sounds funny/cute in slovak, especially for a drug
We call shitty romance novels "red library" because of the common cover color
An especially dark joirnalism that goes out of its way to show misery is "black chronicle".
Can't think of any others
Fun fact: when journalists write about something that is not at all important, we call it "cucumber season". It means that there is nothing going on, so they have to write about cucumbers
Yeah, it is usually whenever the local equivalent of parliament is not in session
Sometimes there are some small cucumber seasons at other times, but that is not all that common
I remember exactly this from my grandma, but about a fly
A fly is sitting on the wall - Śedzi mucha na sceňe (in a dialect)
I would like to see what would happen of Czechoslovakia accepted Marshall plan and didn't 'vote' for commie takeover
Get ready for revolution movements then
We have been waiting to get out of there for centuries
1918 Czechoslovakia for the win
OK so what if we subtly assasinate him and blame it on soviets
Use their trick of 'suicide'. You know write a heart-felt confession how foreign soviet power is forcing him to go against CZSK best outcomes
I agree
It would be very interesting to see what would happen of they just let us be in 1968
To see how far can Prague spring go
Yep Democratic party has won in Slovakia
We were kinda bummed about the czech results
We have a few:
*Zbojník* - They were bandits that lived off the land and robbed people travelling through remote areas
They were known for their rebelous stance against nobility
*Bača* - Basically our version of cowboy/rancher
They lived alone or with helping force on *salaš* (sheep ranch), where they took care of their flock and produced many sheep cheese products
Theh still exist today, but are quite different than their old archetype version
I would say highwaymen, at least in Slovak folklore
Most famously Juraj Jánošík.
Well, since we were part of the Kingdom too, it also applies to Slovakia - Juraj Jánošík being the most famous one here and regarded as a national hero
ahaaa, so that is where word beťár is from
TIL
Afaik there is an EU wide law requiring restaurants to provide tap water for free
But you have to explicitly ask for tap water, if you ask for just “water” they are allowed to sell you bottled water
Austrian economy and salaries
Although I've read that Bratislava does benefit from the Viennese economy somehow
(Maybe due to being so close

Oh we would notice
we would be getting all their mails and stuff, instead of just some
Haha I just came from Denmark after staying there for 2 months
I’ve tried that akvavit and It came pretty easily down my throat, however on the other day it almost came pretty easily upward too
May I ask you what’s the difference between whisky and whiskey
Ugh, I can't believe I used to drink that in shots
Ah the young times
English is quite hard to learn due to the fact that writing does not correspond with pronounciation of the words so you have to learn those two things separately
I still have a problem with pronouncing some words wrongly simply because I pronounce some characters as they are written or sometimes I write a different word which is similar in its written form to a pronunciation of a word I'm actually supposed to write
Regarding grammar - I would say that one is of a medium difficulty
I saw much easier grammar rules (e.g. I found Chinese to have quite easy grammar rules, but I'm only really basic level in that so perhaps it would get harder later) but also more difficult ones
English was very hard for me when I started with it (around the age of 8) up to maybe age of 16-17
The reason might be because as a kid I didn't really put much effort into learning it and I only learned enough to pass exams
The huge break happened when I started with online gaming and watching English series (subtitled tho) around 15-17
So I would say exposure to the language helped a lot
That's also how the babies pick up the language naturally
And English has tons of content online to be exposed to so it's easy to also find an interesting content for yourself which is very important
E.g. it's also relatively easy to find a Chinese content but it's hard to follow it because their movies are often uninteresting for me or full of propaganda BS so it's hard for me to actually keep watching it regularely
English is the easiest language to study
Much easier than German, as it doesn't have the stupid (sorry) der, die, das for everything
I had to learn that from scratch
Oh, and don't mention French
That's the hardest language I have ever had to study, and I speak Hungarian
A guy from my high school (in Košice) started an MLM in Eastern Slovakia that is getting quite big
He preys on poor Eastern Slovaks by promising them a better life and selling them some lame ass supplements

Benátky - Venice
Kodaň - Copenhagen
Not city but country
Austria - Rakúsko
Also funny thing Austria - Hungary was Rakúsko -  Uhorsko but modern Hungary is Maďarsko
>Vienna: Dunaj
I've always found this amusing, since in Slovak "Dunaj" is the name of the river Danube and the city Wien is "Viedeň".
[wiktionary] says:  from Latin *Codania*, from Sinus Codanus (“the Baltic Sea”)
btw some different names in Hungary: Stoličný Belehrad, Ostrihom, Nové Mesto pod Šiatrom, Svätý Ondrej
Are you telling me that Bill isn't short for Billiam
Old name in Slovak was Prešporok, or was changed in 1919

1 € : loaf of bread
10 € : 2 bottles of Borovička
100 € : 2 pairs of Adidas sneakers
hmm
1€ - two chocolate bars in a grocery store

100€ - eleven large pizzas from pizza delivery
Are you telling me that pornhub is a lie

It was fantastic

I guess we do not really have a meme region
easterners joke about westerners and westerners about easterners and hungarians in the south
Or maybe the jokes about the Bratislava elite/café intellectuals
Oh, and about the Czechs that come to die in our mountains :D
Our parliament; most memes here are aimed at politicans
Yeah, but I don't care
I often joke about how terribly some Hungarians speak Slovak
It's fun to make jokes about each other, makes life easier
Isn't there a society that goes every year to Turku's Kauppatori and jumps on it to sink the city to the sea
Funny thing
I am kind of facing this question now, because of a boy obviously
And well its not going well for him
But heey he wants to come to Europe too, so we are kinf of leaning to half half
The only luck is that he lives in a democratic state
The other problem is, this state, famous, rich and all surprised me by having such a huge contrast between classes
Definitely not what I am used to
Plus I am soo terrified about this healthcare issue
Definitely would not want to start family there
The maternity leave is shitty, no normal holydays allowance, the fact you have to pay for having a baby, no additional help
Also even if we decide I am never ever willing to give us European schengen zone citizenship
Not a food, but Alcohol lol, like seriously we drink a lot
For me personally it's Chocolate or cake
Chocolate combined with alcohol is the ultimate combo lmao
Beer, best served with some sausage and fresh bread/buns/rolls
Can relate
Choco with alcohol would be a deadly combo for me
I generally don't like sweet stuff thaat much, but with alcohol it's another level, especially with beer
You might want to specify the alcohol part
But yeah, after the pandemic started and my workload increased with online classes, my beer consumption increased disgutingly
Oh Czech beer is fucking great, we drink it all the time in Slovakia
If you don't offer alcohol(often even several times) to a guest it's considered rude :D
We in Slovakia call Germany Nemecko (which, come to think of it now, also translates to land of the mute people)
We also call The Netherlands Holándsko, which translates to just the state of Holland, and not the entire Netherlands
Germany - Nemecko, Austria - Rakúsko, that's probably all, i don't really remember any other lol, but polish for example call Hungary Węgry and Italy Włochy, i never quite understood why they call them so weird, in slovak we would say 'od veci' xD
Nemecko-Germany
Not a country but, instead of **Venice**/**Venezia**, we say ***Benátky***. I'm from Slovakia and the same goes with Czech language
Possibly more slavic languages
And I have no idea where it came from - there is nothing I could find in the history of Venezia that goes by similar name
Mor Ho
(Kill them
Eagles flew from Tatra, heading for the plains,
over higher mountains, over even straights,
crossing Danube river, the broad water stream,
landed there beyond, Slavic descent rim
Roars the Danube, and moon after moon leave,
over it glows, strong castle on a high cliff
Underneath, the Roman – Emperor deploy his camps
in white shines wide and long rows of his tents
On the edge of camp, the Emperor on golden chair,
round him rulers guard, tough men, strong and fair
In front of the ruler, tiny maine stands,
each in shiny armor, champs of different lands
Whitty hair their necks are whipping
Blue eyes swiftly roundly swiping
Raised as fir tree, hard as stone,
looked all from one mother born
Gorgeous land – its borders washed by Danube strong,
And the rocky Tatra, like a wall runs round along
These lands, those proud mountain walls,
that´s their homeland, the cradle for sons of Slavs
Sent by Slavic tribe, from the famous council,
to deliver greetings, to emperor fearsome
They don´t harm their foreheads, nor falling to the knee,
don´t recognize such slavery in Slovak country
Gods gifts bringing with them, bread and salt to emperor,
and proudly talk to him, to the distant wanderer:
„Slovak nation, priesthood and elders of ours,
send their greetings to you, emperor famous
The land on which your foot want to step,
is ours, from thy God the Slavs did it get
Look: here the borders by the mighty Danube are washed,
there, the Tatra mountain as rocky wall is slashed
Its a blessed land, thank to Lord in heavens,
through the honest work, we starve never
We don´t lay, on what´s others, our hands,
Slav only own sow and reaps only own lands
But if on our door, in best intention stranger knocks,
whoever, from the table Gods gifts at him always looks
Cause the true, given by Gods to the Slavs is,
To have master is injustice, to be one even bigger is
This is the only poem we have to learn in school as far as I'm aware and is considered national poem

Ahh yes criminals not being able to vote is the same as a country with no human rights
It varies
Everyone just calls it "Svätá rímska ríša" = which is actually literal translation of Holy Roman Empire
But I just googled it and that's actually incorrect, and the correct way is "Rímsko-nemecká ríša" = Roman-Germanic Empire
Fascinatingly, without the Holy
tldr:
People say: Holy Roman Empire / Svätá rímska ríša
Correct way in our language: Roman-Germanic Empire / Rímsko-nemecká ríša (Without the Holy/Svätá!)
We usually call it the same, although someitmes we also say "Svätá rímska ríša národa nemeckého" - Holy Roman Empire of the German nation
I always talk about something in slovak and then forget the word but I know what it is in english and vice versa
Jozef Tiso
Not those you mentioned but far-right politics are at rise
It changed everything
We got our freedom, we got our first country we lived nice and happily, then were betrayed and given to nazis, then became East part of the wall then got some Russian tanks, then the regime fell, that caused lot of corruption in 90 because of the leftovers of the commie power greedily took the money
Then we joined EU and now we are better than ever
There are still people who try to pretend EU done nothing and I wish I cold punch them, because we are better than ever
Complaining is our national sport and everything is bad, but our GDP basically skyrocketed and standard of living is good
I even prefer to live here than when I lived in UK, I think we definitely have less contrast between classes (minus the Roma
) but ore racism and xenophobia basically because we were hardly ever exposed to the outside world, so no African immigration or any other really no one comes here

I can think only about Hungarian sounding / spelled names and surnames which indicates that the person is from the south of Slovakia
Oof it’s quite hard to say in Slovakia
But usually Hungarian sounding names (Andráši) or full on Hungarian ones (Bugár, Világi, Kovács, Andrássy, Katona) are from the south, where we’ve got the highest population of Hungarians
German ones are usually from the middle part or east, coming from towns that have a traditional German population from as far back as the Middle Ages
Slavic names are all over the place
Ukraine-sounding ones (Saskia) or orthodox christian ones are from the East
Polish sounding ones (Czerny) from the north, close to the border with Poland
Czech names are all over as we were one country before
The “most Slovak” names are found usually in the middle part of Slovakia and around the mountains
The capital is quite cosmopolitan in this regard
I answered a similar question some time ago:
>Not much, there are just certain features of surnames coming from the regional dialects which can give you a hint
Surnames from the west won't have Ľ, in the east you can find more ŠČ, DZ and DŽ. Some endings also reflects the dialects, like -lák in the west, -liak in the centre, -ľák in the east
>Apart from this, you can find Czech sounding -il /-al ending in the west, around Bratislava and Trnava Croatian sounding surnames are common (like -čič), in the very east some East Slavic (-in, -enko) too
Hungarian and German surnames are common all over the country
>Slovak surnames are also very diverse in general, in a group of 100 there's little chance there will be more people with the same surname unless they're a family (maybe twice Horváth or Kováč)
Are there any Ukrainian or Rusyn surnames that I'm unaware of
btw the meaning is "musician"

[Ikarus 280] All credit goes to Hungary, of course, but I just loved riding them when I was a kid
The four-part doors, the rubber joint, the noise, the sense of impending doom when driving downhill

You are like Tenet land, moving backwards in time, it seems
I remember when I was little I could go to the store with 100SK (about 3
3€) and I could walk out with a basket full of candy chips and ice cream
They still have the old Tatra trams in Pyongyang, you know
Sure, Karosas are also carved deeply into everyone's memory, but the Ikarus door were mesmerizing
Like, how could they even work
But in reality it's so Hungarian it can almost run on paprika

I prefer Ikarus 435 and 415 but this is very nostalgic
Yet, in your defence, it fascinates me how quickly you are progressing with the A1 motorway recently
You should be an insipration for the construction of our D1

Come over here and get a ball, I'll get an angle grinder
Yeah, totally, now that the world is shifting towards high-speed railways
It would be great to have a link along the Adriatic coast all the way to Tirana and maybe further down to Greece
Hopefully, at least the Adriatic highway construction won't stall
Yes
Also Tesco (with very long tradition), Billa, needless to say LIDL, and there were also Carrefour, Hypernova and even Marks & Spencer
I have never even visited
Although I would have this summer, if it wasn't for COVID
I just love travelling and when I don't have the money or freedom to travel in person, I finger travel on Google Earth and Wikipedia, checking out cities, airports and roads all over Europe
I think Honest Guide managed to show off Slovakia better than anyone from Slovakia that I've seen
I do like Czechia, the only think i would suggest would be for chechnya to get rid of green and yellow in their flag in favour of blue, to master this whole chechno-slovenia confusion
We say “česko” (Czechland
) in conversation but officially it’s “Česká Republika”
I love Czechia
I didnt know you have own writing system until now
I have learned a new thing, however having said that, it looks super chaotic (and reminds me a bit of thai), i wish i saw armenian handwriting/cursive, if there is such thing
How is this related
It is an english term, not protuguese one, in portugal you can call it Chéquie like brazilians, cant you
Why would you use english term in portuguese, you dont do that to other words
Czechia even in czech language sounds stupid, they call it "česko" or "čechy" (which funny enough is only a part of czech republic)
wow, you can use "ia" and "ija" in russian language, i have never thought of that
Are there many russian words with both cases
because here pretty much everything wit "ija" sound is written as "ia" "letter/phone" (because slovak unlike english or most languages really doesnt only have vowels and constants, but also "doublephones" like eastern slavic languages - ia, ie, iu, ô)
Fascinating that you, georgia and greece are so close together, yet have completely unique writing systems
And to the examples, like that - alphabet- it looks reasonable, what it looks like in text
For example i can read cyrilic (asbuka) but when i see handwritten text, it just get very overwhelming haha, it is just like someone is trying his new pen
It is pretty much the same thing over here with holand, i cant see how this is going to change
Netherland is being called "Holandsko" - the same as holand
But i cant imagine a change
They could call it "nizozemsko" (like in czechia hahaha), "dolnozemsko" or something similar, but it would make no sense using it further, the word for "people of netherland" would be some crazy nonsense
However having said that, this is about english language not about portuguese or slovak
Why stupid and wrong
I dont understand how is it different in this sense
I understand differences like "eu estou correndo" and "eu estou a correr", or those "sumo"-"suco", or "cao"-"cachorro", but i dont see how using Chéquie would be problem for portuguese speaking, other than being it a foreign word
Chzechia is an english word, transcribed to english
Because no one expects english speakers to use "česko". But your native language uses different phonetical rules from english
You obviously wouldnt use "Czechia" in portuguese, as it makes no sense
It is not even possible to write down in many languages
Thats because it is an english word, meant for english speakers
We also cant use some english words in slovak
If you learn english you have hard time to pronounce some english words because of different phonetics of course, but this is meant for english speakers
Forget about english, my question basically was, if there are russian words with sequence "иа" which would be pronounced as "ия". Because in slovak "ия" would be transcribed as "ija", but it is basically never written this way, it is always written as "ia" wich is alternative to russian "я" - as a letter
Naaah, most people over here cant read cyrillic, even those older ones who had russian at school haha
Also slovenia, croatia use latin, i think serbians use both to some degree
And funky, but much better then expected haha, i was expecting something like [this] or [this]
How is that related
You can call czech republic however you want in portuguese
But i just dont understand why you are trying to use portuguese pronunciationon english word
It cant work by definition
English has completely different rules for pronunciation
You obviously are not going use the term czechia in portuguese, why would you
It is an english term
Oh okay
Because in slovak you have words like "polícIA" which is pronounced as "polícIja" with "i" but then there are words like "hroIAci", pronounced as "horjaci" without "i".
In Slovak is jealousy "žiarlivosť" and envy is "závisť".

Bratislava is everything – all the big international companies have Slovak HQs here

That basically applies for the rest of Slovakia
In how many European languages can you say "thank you"?
I counted like 20 (PT, ES, FR, EN, IT, NL, DE, DK, SE, NO, PL, CZ, SK, HU, SI, HR, SR, UA, RU, GR, GE) and I am expecting most people to kick my ass
Slovakian, Russian, English, French, Hungarian, German, Dutch, Spanish, Italian, Serbian, Bosnian, Croat, Slovene, Polish,  Turkish
It's "madloba" in Georgian, "obrigado" in Portuguese and ~~"eucharistio"~~ "efharisto" in Greek, I believe
Just those I expect fewer people to know
Is this a bait
Hvala works for the whole former Yugoslavia, except for DPRM
Will you initiate us all into the first three
It's "hvala", from Ljubljana to Vranje
Why won't you make it a separate post
Errr
I haven't heard any merci in Hungary, only köszönöm.
You know Finnish, but you don't know German
Easy - in Yugoslavia, except for NM, it's hvala (NM - fala), in Polish it is dziękuję, which is exactly how Borat says thanks in his fake Kazakh and Czech and Slovak are similar (Děkuji [dyekuyi]/ďakujem [dyakuyem])
How different is it in Asturian compared to Castillan
You know Maltese though
It is easy to remember Polish "dziękuję", because it's what Borat says in his fake Kazakh
I bet you know that polandball strip where every countryball says "tak" and they all mean something different, right
If your name is Jim, beware, you should say "obrigad*o*".
Czech (děkuji) and Slovak (ďakujem) are little different
Very good in general, but you are assuming wrong
Ukraine is on the same team with western Slavs, with "dyakuyu" (PL: dziemkuyem, CZ: dyekuyi, SK: dyakuyem)
Both are used a lot

It does resemble "obliged", doesn't it
I was surprised to learn it too
Oddly, I only heard it from the speaker, not read it
But it sounded to me, as I wrote
Maybe I am just used to the sound of the word "eucharistia" in Slovak, from Christian liturgy

After the Great War, during the next war with Hungary, one of our generals had an idea to scare Hungarian soldiers and lower the morale
The idea was to make a few soldiers do blackface and go around villages and cities speaking gibberish, but often mentioning Senegal
Turns out it was successful and the Hungarians created the rumor of a 2000 african soldiers, hardened from the war in France, helping Czechoslovaks
Some abandoned their positions in fear of being "canibalized by the blacks", others due to the fear of being overwhelmed
The anthem of Yugoslavia "Hey slavs
" is overwritten song from Slovakia called "Hey Slovaks
". It was written as a response to forceful magyarization and was used as an official anthem by the Slovak State (Nazi puppet state)
And as you can imagine, it gained a reputation as a song used by neo-nazis and ultra-nationalist, which is shame, because I love it
Apparently Slovakia farms edible frogs but I haven't seen any anywhere
French do be buying weird stuff aye
Civ5 has that as a bonus with Maria Theresia (austria)
Just don't.
But La Marseillaise isn't about the city Marseille
I don't actually know why they adapted it
It is also used as a inter-slavic anthem, so maybe that's why
It wasn't. The text was written by studen of Štúr - Ján Matuška, and the music comes from Slovak folk song Kopala Studienku
Oh man, Slovaks would be strong contenders with ya
The cashiers are fast AF here but the number of working cashiers is around half compared to other shops so the queues are long eitherway

Mannnnnn, we have 65 political parties and most of them are weird
From those bigger ones in parliament
Probably the weirdest ones are neonazis, with politicians with literally tattoed auschwitz over their whole chest, or swastikas
Smer SD- they created most corrupted government, everyone knew that they were robbing the state but still managed somehow to win elections many times, this year they finally didn't,
ĽSNS - 'people's party our Slovakia' - they are nazi extremists, people vote them despite of this, and Sme rodina  -  We are family, their leader is a guy that has about 11 children with 10 different women or sth like that
Czechia has the pirate party in the government
Seriously
You are right
I thought they were in the government
I have always seen them in TV, this trio babiš, okaumra and the pirate guy
slovakia, any country smaller than us has to be really small, so i would consider as big the other xD
Vyhne
It's a small town near the city Banská Štiavnica, the town is in a  forest in a small valley
It's really beautiful
Yes great city, I have family here
Czech and Slovak (though i think more slovak, may be biased) are great too, its usually few youtubers that keep them going, the current meme that i dare say is our original is stokarske memes, basically horrible grammar and wordmaking and sometimes they use slang as well
Pretty strong on instagram, there has been a big boom recently and there are dozens of active pages
We even have our own kind of memes called "stokarske memes" (something like white trash memes) which embrace our alcoholic / gambling / drug culture and are generally written in poor language lots of grammatical mistakes
Some example can be seen here
Biology teachers in schools
It's not a separate subject, just a small part in biology class
Slovenia sends their wrongly adresed mail to us each month
Just crown Schwarzenberg already
Wasn't China also allowed
I feel like even in 200 years some people will still be like "Slovakia, oh you mean Czechoslovakia
i know that place" lol
I shudder at the thought
A batch of troops were late and everyone tought that they would come mid battle, but they didn't the Ottomans demolished us and then the king drowned while fleeing, thus throw Hungary into a three way Civil War (Hungary, Habsburgs, Ottomans) that lasted 163 years and then Hungary became a part of the Habsburg empire, wich led to their union in the late 19th century, wich led to them defending the Habsburgs in ww1
Or when we fought for freedom the Russians came to help the Habsburgs becouse of a union that was put in place, because of Napoleon
Yes, same happened to us
Of course not, we were merely a puppet, these kinds of things were decided in Moscow
The entire Eastern part
According to our previous PM, "There is nothing there".
If you don't want it just give the city to us
It's already Slovak anyway
Nope
I do it all the time
Sorts out the dinner
In USA i do it like 99% of time
The food portions are huge and I hate wasting food
They usually have a package option
Sometimes you pay like one euro for Styrofoam
I guess you don't do it in a Michelin star restaurants, but its not like I can afford those
Normal thing, but it does not happen often, people dont go to restaurant to eat up and leave, we go there to eat some, drink some, talk some and have a nice evening/noon/whatever part of the day but rarely breakfast
QWERTZ with additional buttons for ľ š č ť ž ý á í é ú ä ň ô (for the rest of the letters we need to use a combination of keys)
The keyboards are usually Czech-Slovak here, so there are two letters on some buttons for the respective languages
I'm so accustomed to QWERTZ that using QWERTY is a real pain for me
When being abroad I always find it hard to not answer "How are you
" greetings with how my day exactly is
In my home country, Slovakia, people tend to answer honestly
If the day was shit, they'll say so and explain why
If it was good, they'll say so and explain why
If it was average, they'll also say so and explain why
But abroad people expect you to say "I'm fine". Nothing more and nothing less, regardless of how you actually feel :D
Hungarian: Nagyon szép vagy drágám (You are very beautiful my dear)
Slovak: This is a bit more tricky due to sex differentiation
Si veľmi krásna/ý moja/môj drahá/ý (second words are for masculine)
Czech: Jsi velice krásná/ý má/múj drahá/ý.
I admit
a little bit :D
This is more a European vs Asian difference I'd say
Our mentality basically changed that people are tanned because they go on vacations while in Asia having pale skin means having a comfortable (and probably decently-paid) office job
People tend to become very pale when they're sick
It's not about where you're from, it's about how our body functions
There are quite a lot of dialects in Slovakia considering how small the country is
I’m not even sure how many there are but the main 3 ones are the western dialect, the mid-country dialect and the eastern dialect
I feel like they’re much more prominent in the countryside
If you live in any bigger ‘city’ you probably won’t speak in a very specific dialect
Mostly negative, accent and dialects don't have the prestige other countries like the UK has
Basically, if you speak any (slovak not foreign) accent (except for northern), it doesnt improve your image, and you are seen as "lower class". I dont know about posh, but the northern is like from fairytale, so it is seen as proper/oldschool/charming
As Slovak I understand someone from Ostrava better,than someone from Prague
Well, the dialects change from village to village or town to town, but they are similiar in west, east and mid
For instance I am from Spiš and have different dialect, than people from Abov or from Šariš. All those regions are in west of the country and for someone from outside are similiar or even same, but I can hear and see a lot of differences
No, there might be sometimes a reward offered for information leading to the arrest of wanted criminal (it's pretty rare tho), but you are supposed to give such info to the police which then handles the arrest
You aren't supposed to act on your own
Surprisingly, only 7
Rly
We have like 200 castles
At least our caves are included
Edit: they are not, apparently it's some shared caves with hungary
Somewhere
They didn't even put the biggest cave system there, with all year permafrost spanning several KMs underground
Shame on you UNESCO, you did us dirty
In Slovakia I know about 3 things that are disputed
If you eat schnitzel with rice or with potatoes
If you put meat into Christmas Sauerkraut soup or not
If Horalky (wafers with peanut spread filling) are better than Tatranky (hazelnut spread)
Yep, palacinka in Slovakia and palačinka in CZ
Notslovenia
And I would change Slovenia to Notslovakia, that way no one will confuse us anymore
And we call you Rakúsko after some small city [Raabs an der Thaya]
Exactly what i was thinking about my friend
What about something from my language
We call you Gruzínsko so Gruzia
That not bad
What about something from my language
We call you Gruzínsko so Gruzia
That not bad
And than some west Slavic guys:
[BENÁTKY ]
And the french got it from Vienna, not from Croatia directly
Yeah
But I was just confused, why is it so different and I found, you ministry of
Foreign affairs don't wanna be called Gruzia (or similar Slavic names) so for example Ukraine call you Sakartvelo
But it's haaaaard word for me
Definitely bullshit
It's not the East block in the 80's anymore, everyone have at least some kind of labeled clothing
I am not even counting band merch into that, which is also relatively common
People wear what they want
Most of my stuff does have some logo
I usually wear Adidas sneakers and backpacks, got Nike jacket and rest of the stuff are just the brands you never heard of, coz they are cheap
Yeah buying Adidas Sneakers for 65 € is the height of luxury for me lol
If WW3 starts we are between Ukraine and Western Europe
We are like Poland
So I have fear of Ukraine
Well you dont have to worry about that one anymore
We suck lately
Gone are the times when we got that bronze medal from you
Well, you'd be able to find people defending Orbán IRL in Slovakia as well, of all places
I don't know many Slovak Hungarians, but Slovak nationalists, alt-righters, and other right-wing extremists seem to have a boner for Orbán (his disdain towards immigrants, liberal democracy, the LGBTQ community, etc
The war of Charles I. against the highlords of Hungary (Matthew Csak, Amade Aba and the rest)
The Kingdom of Hungary had tonnes of castles, towns and such, so it would lend itself well to the AC open-world formula
You could also include the Adratic Sea/Balaton/Danube for ship gameplay too
For me it would be the 14th century, that's when our kingdom was the biggest
Matthew Csak
Matúš Čák.
Yes, especially on the Hungarian channels
There was even an uproar from the public once, when they wanted to skip airing it a certain year
It's a staple of both Hungarian and Slovak christmas
In Slovakia there's also Harry Potter
Every year they aired the newest part before christmas, and nowadays they air all of the movies during the weeks leading up to christmas
Other christmas movies are of course, old Czechoslovak and Slovak movies like Kurvahosigutntag, Mrazik (Frost father
), Vrchni prchni, Jak vytrhnout velrybe stolicku (these are mostly czech comedies, I love them) and so on (like Fantaghiro or other old foreign live action fairy tales, czechs and slovaks love those)
'Sedláci' or 'sedlač'.
With Czech it's like 97% inteligible
Polish barely anything, Russian a few words and others probably nothing
I agree
[Hanging by the rib] using hook
Beheading was also popular, and in 20th century hanging and shooting squads (popular during ww2)
Communists liked hanging, last execution took place in Bratislava in 1989
Good ol' hanging by the neck or piercing a hook through the ribs
I looked it up and it's terrifying that it was still used in 1974
came here for the hook&rib
Sponsored by the "slipped on peas" gang
Shame, shame, shame, shame
By default, education is in Slovak only, but it is not a requirement at all levels
There are exceptions; Hungarian minority have schools that are bi-lingual, some courses in Hungarian, some in Slovak
You then also have some high-schools that are bi-lingual by choice, usually English, French, German or Spanish as the 2nd language
Universities are Slovak primarily, but you can opt in to take some degrees in some unis in English, but this usually carries a paid tuition, unlike the free Slovak option
Then, you also have plenty of private schools that are often uni-lingual with a foreign language only
None at all
The Hungarians in the south are satisfied with their position, a lot of Romas live from welfare, so they need the government, we barely know Rusyns exist except of knowing them personally or remembering they celebrate the major holidays later than we are
Yes us hungarians want to separate from slovakia
Ok, you can just stop flexing, ok
In my region we have this unspoken rule that we call different grandparents a different synonym for grandma and grandpa
Father's side - babka, dedko
Mother's side - starenka, stareček
Both are also used as in "generic old person" and outside our region people use these pair but don't adhere to this rule
Also a way to distinguish, I heard of children who have one pair of grandparents that speak Hungarian call them by the Hungarian name for grandma and grandpa
The grandparents are often bilingual but they want to differentiate them so
In slovak a dragon is "drak" but funny enough the paper kite kids fly in autumn we call "šarkan". This way we can differentiate them
Although children today call a kite "drak" too, since most of them look like one and the word šarkan is becoming (if it's not already) archaic, because it's too specific and foreign sounding
Spelling reforms are for pussies, let's write like they did in the middle ages when people had no idea how to write shit so they just made it all up
Strange, I though slavic languages used *mesiac* for both
Though I heard about *Lunochod* witch should have been a hint
. .
This way you can talk to your dentist while he's operating on you, cool
We would use *polmesiac* for crescent, as in half moon
(Though I know it isn't really half moon :)
Nope, only derivates borrowed from other languages (lunárny modul, lunochod, lunárny kalendár) not the word luna itself
I've literally never heard someone say "polmesiac" other than in the context of the Turkish flag or Islam as a whole
I identify with myself, then the world, then the EU, then my city, then my region and I don’t identify with my country at all
Nationalism is only good as an excuse for war
Borders are purely political bullshit that was mostly argued hundreds if not thousands of years ago
I’m from southwestern Slovakia and our culture and geography is much closer to neighboring regions in Hungary and Czechia than to northeastern Slovakia
Also I see no reason why I should be proud of the place just cause I was born in it
I wish people would just stop arguing about pointless borders and cultural disputes and just started accepting each other and strive together for technological and societal progress
Hmmm mostly playing footbal, hockey (or rather hockeyball), and climbing -  trees, buildings, rocks
Also we were making bows and arrows with our knives and shooting around, also making those balloon guns and shoot rowan around, also those kinder surprise grenades
Rural is better when you try to connect it to a different word…like juror
So you get Rural Juror
OK hear me out
Taiwan
Yes it is an island, i get that, but look at their history and then at the history of Slovakia
So many of instances of similarities
The brush with communism
Them being on mercy of foreign powers
In 40ties overtaken by the axis powers
The martial law, the censorship, the fall of communism and the consecutive democratisation
Also China is their Russia
So basically I feels strangely connected to countries in Asia who had brush with commies
Similarly a bit with Vietnam
And a bit with Korea, but I feel like thats a German territory there, before they got the east Germany back
this and progressive presidents
Probably [Sandberg] in Bratislava, which was a sea bottom/shore in the prehistoric times (millions of years ago), when Europe was under the sea
You can easily find fossils of shells there
It was discovered during mining operations, I used to play as a kid there
The area is protected now, also because of the unique flora and fauna, so one should be careful there
Strangely, there is no English Wikipedia article on this
There's a village called Panické Dravce which can mean
* *panic predators*
* *male virgin predators*
We also have a villages called **Horný Bar**, *Don'tBeScared* (Nebojsa) or *Naked Man* (Naháč)
I know that there's a city in Czechia called "Pičín" which is very roughly translated as Pussyville
There is a village in poland called "kokot", which is the most vulgar term for cock in slovak language
And it is doubly funny because it is in poland
In prague there is a park called "židovské pece" which means "jew furnaces"
Well I remember that
What the hell was that guy thinking
Better let that train crash into me than drive and away
Ah, Ljubljana is a beautiful city
I loved Prague when I visited it, Czechoslovakia
So you had war in 90's, right
Jokes aside, it really depends, usually people do not have any opinion as they do not have many info about my country, altough it is getting better and more people visited it
I do not understand only when our neighbourghs do not know anything about us, that is weird
How is popular teleshopping in your country
Do you trust teleshopping
In Slovakia our seniors like very much teleshopping
Younger people calling teleshopping scam
How about your country
Happy cake day
Same here delimano and dormeo
Non so perché ho guardato l'intero video
Yes many teleshoppings here are translated from english and clips are from US
[I guess this one
It was taken by Ladislav Bielik in Bratislava, August 1968
Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia
except of romance languages, which are all beautiful i find nice swedish and i don't know why also basque - i am just fascinated when i hear those two languages lol
You got some traveling
Throughout our history, quite often, especially while being under Hungary or Austria-Hungary
Then how can he be a PM If he is technically a foreigner
He's also very much against migration
He defends himself by saying that his mum was born in Moravia
Not sure how that helps him
what is bad about Russian vaccine ? I thought thaht our common goal was to save lives and end this outbreak , but also in Slovakia governmnet is at risk of breakup because of disagreemnt with aquiring Sputnik ...
Full agree on the chinese one ....i think that Russia wants to ide this vaccine as showing "the west" how cutting edge they are , so i think IT will be good ...(like i heard that Moderna or Astra not sure, Has pretty Bad side effects but is allowed ) so i think that its mainly the extremly rusophobic politicians that want to block it
Accidentally the most effective teacher you could have
Not gonna forget it if you had to fact-check it
>"Hoj mor ho
detvo môjho rodu, kto kradmou rukou siahne na tvoju slobodu"
(The poem uses some unique archaic words that I can't translate 1:1, but I will do my best)
Strike Him, offspring of my blood, him whose hand would steal your freedom
It is from the poem Mor ho
- a poem about a fictional event where a roman "czar" sets out to conquer pannonia
The local slavs send a delegation of young warriors who tell him that he is welcome to the land, but if he tries to conquer it, he will regret it dearly
The "czar" of course tells them to surrender, so the warriors, bellowing the battle cry "mor ho
" attack him
The "czar's" soldiers defend him, and cut down all the youths, but only at a great cost
The poem reflects the Slovak fight for freedom, that at the time (1864) still seemed futile
Slovakian author Andrej Sladkovic:, poem Marina;
"Dear motherland I want to love in beautiful Marina,
Dear Marina, whom I love in wonderful fatherland,
Embracing them both in one being"
It was about embracing love to your country and to a woman at the same time
Romanticism, 19th century
To his memorial, we built a "bank of love" in the most picturesque town in Slovakia, Banska Stiavnica, where couples come to celebrate their love
Haha, no one outside ever makes a nice accurate film about Slovakia
The only only foreigners who ever portrayed us nicely are Czechs, and thats because they love Tatras and like to sometimes shoot romantic films there
Plus they are not really foreigners
Also I have seen a Japanese dorama that used a National theatre in Bratislava for few scenes, but I think they pretended it was Prague
Are there any movies that portray anything well
Scripted movies favor stereotypes to reinforce their narrative, this especially applies for portraying foreign countries
Freaking love that film
Its one of the best films ever
Made me super sad to
Thanks for reminding me, gotta rewatch
But you *are* exactly somewhere in between those first two, aren't you
So how do you like Mamma Mia
Well at least they often make them look sexi
Cinema verite films usually do
And when someone who lives there makes a great film
Starting a fight
Seriously
Usually drunk british tourists start fights
just dont do it
Not only because it is wrong itself, but many people in slovakia know how to fight or carry some sort of weapon with them (tear gas, boxer, baton, knife
) and once it gets into an actual fight it can get pretty nasty
Just dont do that, enjoy your beer, food etc
dont cause such problems - to locals and also to yourself
Go hiking in flip flops
There is nothing manly about this behaviour
I used to box (like the sport) and still dont understand that the same way that all the boxers from the gym just didnt get it
I think those are just frustrated people and for many of them this is the only way to make other human being to touch them
I don't know anyone who carries a pepper spray or a knife
Maybe op runs with a wild crew
I mean the first time I have seen bar fight was when I studied in UK and it was wow like in the films
And I used to hangout with metal heads in high school
But to be fair no one really likes drunk noisy violent British tourists
Tbh, he's exaggerating a bit with this piece of info
There are just some places where fellow drunken Slovaks (the Macho, kinda extremist type) usually attend and can be equally as annoying
They also tend to start fights and encountering a foreigner with the same attitude won't and don't end up well
So yeah, just like anywhere else, when you tend to get wasted, just don't pick the wrong person to fight with :D
Other than that, it's pretty safe
Slovakia is pretty safe country in general
That was not my point
But fighting sports are quite popular over here, many people do boxing, muay thai, mma etc
as a hobby
There is still this macho mentality in the country even tough now it is more about minority, but you can easily find a person who knows how to protect himself
Possession of cold weapons (pepper spray, knife, baton, boxer, gas pistol etc
) is completely legal in slovakia, and also (despite what even many slovaks think), the self defense law plays in favour of the victim (like one year ago two drunk guys wanted to attack an indian guy, he stabbed one in the neck and this one died, the indian guy wasnt prosecuted because of act of self defense)
There are some places where there is still this macho culture pretty alive, but honestly as a tourist you are most likely not going to get there
People in bigger cities still carry weapons (not all of them of course, but way much more than in UK for example)
I tried to search for an incident like that what i remember but i cant find it, it happened few years ago in bratislava, where some group of drunk british tourists attacked a couple and the guy stabbed two of them
But honetsly it is hit or miss, most of the time if you as a foreigner try to attack people, people would go away - as they dont want to get involved in violence, even if they carry a weapon or know how to fight - because people dont want to end their night with a fight (especially in bigger cities)
But once you find similar person, it can get nasty
If i am not mistaken, carrying a weapon is illegal in UK
Czech tourists and hiking in sandals, name better duo
thats what you get after splitting from Czechoslovenia
I think this may be a bit your experience but I personally don't know anyone who carries weapons as that
Or ever seen a bar fight
I like beer as every slovak and walked home drunk alone many times
Maybe if you mean neonazi groups but those are everywhere in Europe
It's like copy paste macho guys
Also British, but especially some from London and Glasgow are pretty proficient in stabbing
Seriously
What about Obchodná in bratislava, there is a fight almost every weekend, sometimes multiple ones
Are those all neonazis
And yes, glasgow and london have stabbings, but how is it relevant
Thats why carrying a weapon is illegal
Here we are in opposite situation (thank god) where street crime is getting better and better year by year
Maybe our criminals go to UK :D. But seriously, i see a different problem in UK: Here in slovakia police can just stop you and search you, and once they find something you shouldnt have, you go to jail
In uk knifes are illegal per se, but police can do pretty much nothing about it, because everyone ha so many rights
Also here if something goes down, police shoot (they even carry an attack rifle in their car if i am not mistaken), in UK they can blow their whistle and pray for the best
Sorry, I just haven't had experience with it
I take the night bus from the Hodžko and its okay
But I am also not a club person anymore maybe KC Dunaj from time to time, but that's not really a club, I go to a better looking pubs
The only place we go to at Obchodná is Slovak pub
I don't really have any friends who look out for the fights or even been in one
Also if there is so many fights and after the shooting fiasco, good riddance on increased police presence there
Also the football fight was shitty time, those people who fought there were bastards
I just want a common European Army already so that they can all get out
besides that i find it outrageous
This is purely my opinion,
Pizza, Pasta in general - spagetti, tagliatelle
Cheese, salami, ham
Any kind of bread and also any baking
Sweets - butter biscuits, chocolate
All food is better in Europe duh, them food regulations are hardcore here
Than question would be what is better in France than anywhere else in the world
Kinda misunderstood question
Hmmm, I do not know about that if we have good duck meat or chicken meat, because I am so used to it
Hehe
But still what do I love eat with duck is this:
It is duck with potato dough (also called slovak potato flatbread) with red cabbage
So, if you sit somewhere in US and wants to order Spagetti, Lasagne, Ravioli, Rigatoni, Tortellini, Linguine, Penne, Pappardelle, Elbows, Farfalle
It would taste better in Europe
Pasta has place of origin in Italy
Asia in general do not make pasta, they make noodles, taste and serving is different as well
So you can not really compare them
If question would be who has best noodles, then you can run vote chart for Japan, China, Indonesia, India
It does exist in North Africa, Middle East - but, how can you know it is not imported from Italy, or they made their own recipes, even if they call it pasta, it is waaaay away from true pasta taste (yeah I tasted it) that has a centuries of long history in Italy
Nope
But polish products can be found in the shops
Mostly sweets
And krowky
Prussia and Germany overall before the world wars
1896 hungary had a year long parade celebrating  the honfoglalás (coming into europe)
I would like to go back to 1896
Millenium celebration
I don’t watch sport a lot so I don’t really know that many
I only recognize the UK and Germany’s anthem
I do know the American and Canadian tho
But I guess I definitely need to check out other European anthems
Anthems are my guilty pleasure and I also like to learn different languages so that is why I know quite a lot of them
I know the melody and lyrics of these:
Slovak (I am Slovak)
Czech
Polish
Soviet (i know only the begining of russian)
Italian
German
English
Scottish
South African (my favourite)
Israeli
American
French
Canadian
I can also recognize all european anthems and anthems of big countries
There is just something really appealing in anthems, haha
As a young Slovak, I can sing Czech anthem because they beat us awfully lot at Football and Ice hockey
Although my parents remember it from Czechoslovakia times, they don't watch sports
Then I can sing God Save The Queen, from my English class
Also I can hum Deutschlandlied from my German class
Far eastern Slovaks, from Zemplín, never could understand them
It's Slovak, but Polish and Ukrainian at the same time
Central Slovaks understand them better, probably, but for people on the other side of the country
no way
If you include minority languages of the same language group, then Rusyns and Gorals are just slightly less intelligible than Eastern Slovaks
But honestly, you still understand more than when you hear Hungarians speaking Slovak
jk :)
It's not slang
They're dialects
Slang is used by subcultures, dialects by ethnic groups and subgroups, calling them slang is pretty disparaging to the cultural and linguistic value they have
And my god, I love them
Central Moravian dialects are the prettiest Slavic languages/dialects ever
The long vowel endings
hell yeah
I am from the West and I understand Polish more than Eastern dialects, lol
But if they speak proper slovak with just accent, it is understandable but a bit annoying as the accent is totally the other way around and the dynamic is different
And Hungarian accent is cute and funny, not that annoying to me
Are you assuming New Frenchmen (and women of course) aren't from France
That's pretty problematic
I'm from the northwest, that's why I dislike the accent :D
Come definiresti il linguaggio che si parla a Roma
Lo capiscono tutti, per esempio nella serie Suburra
Yeah, I mean, even in Slovakia, you'll find every village in the mountains to have a sightly different dialect
But they become wildly different only after you enter another cultural area
Everything is French if you want it to be
I wasn't being serious ;)
Nowadays, mostly December-February in the lowlands, although brine is all that's left of it by noon
I Slovak we use commas as decimal seperators and spaces for thousands:
1 201,55€
why is your country Prague
Exactly the same everywhere except for the Anglosphere
The Anglosphere at it again
Slovakia: caputová Kofola
Hungary: everything
In Slovak, we pronounce it with Sh and also the original pronunciation in Hungarian is with Sh
However, it doesn’t mean that pronouncing it with S in another language is wrong
For example I say Londýn, italians say Londra and spanish say Londres
None of us say London
That doesn’t mean that those pronunciations in the other languages are wrong
Budapešť, so soft s (š - sh) and soft t (ť - I don't really know how to write it phonetically)
The real question is if you pronounce it with t or ť.
> ť - I don't really know how to write it phonetically
There really isn't an option for that in English
The closest you can go to explain the sound is to read tya and the sound the t makes in that combination
It's like explaining w to a Slovak where that sound only really exists as a part of ô /wo/.
Just say voiceless palatal plosive, it's the same everywhere
> but I think that 'correct' pronunciation in English is with s, so I usually go with that
Well, then you're wrong
It's as easy as that
it íznt bat oukéj
German
I spent years trying to learn it in school, but always saw it as being in competition with English as the foreign language I excel at, so I grew to despise it as a child
I was a dumb 11 year old, no clue why I created that binary in my head
I’d love to be fluent, the language is cool, I do enjoy the grammar for the most part, and it’s useful in Europe
French
I have never even tried learning French
I adore French baking, make a bunch if entremets and tarts
I’d love to speak it so I can go on a vacation through French countryside and enjoy myself without a language barrier
Cantonese
Because I adore Hong Kong and it’s far more difficult than even Mandarin
I usually go by UN languages
So need to finish my French
That makes three
But I would like to choose some more unusual language
For example Japanese, or Swahili can get you some really nice translation jobs
Especially anywhere with Japanese company in Europe as their language proficiency with European languages is usually ehm lower
Sorry guys
But Japanese companies in europe make great use of their translators
Especially if its something as German, Japanese and English combo
Or french combo
I still think that Slovak, closely followed by Czech, has the best ortography for Slavic languages
Clearly, I’m partial to it as a Slovak speaker, but it being almost entirely phonetic (the whole phonetic thing got ruined by the introduction of “y” which sounds just like “i”) is nice
And we have single characters for a bunch of common sounds that other Slavic languages use multiple characters to express - ž, č, š, ď, ť, ň, ľ, á, é, í, ó, ú, ô, ĺ, ŕ.
Whenever I see latinized Ukrainian, I wish they just used our alphabet
It can handle the sounds better than any other
In Slovakia a lot of them got removed (those of Soviet politicians), and streets and schools got renamed
I say keeping the monuments to fallen Soviet soldiers makes sense, since they sacrificed themselves to free us from the Germans, but statues, plaques or anything praising people like Stalin, Brezhnyev and so should be removed
Agreed
All the monuments make sense and I am totally for keeping them
Any place can be used for propaganda if You want to, but memorials are a thing that should be kept to remind people of the past
"Step closer to the urinal
Every officer is armed with handgun, and there is one assault rifle in all patrol cars - this rule was established after 2010 shooting in Bratislava, where officers with handguns couldn't stop active shooter armed with military grade VZ58 assault rifle
However, officers don't carry it outside unless really necessary
Sometimes, during high-activity events (like Christmas markets), there are officers with assault rifles or even fully geared solders walking around
Police without guns are more uncommon than the armed ones
Every cop has a handgun here, except riot police of course, they have other means of crowd control at their disposal
I was in Prague few years back, and I remember being surprised when I saw police armed with assault rifles at Masarykovo nádraží. However, I haven't seen armed officers anywhere else in Prague
Same in Slovakia
Same in Slovakia
Depends on if it’s in a restaurant or at home
When it’s at home, we usually host family gatherings at our weekend house so we sit outside, prepare some food - often barbecue
And we just sit and talk and drink
I usually spend the time playing board games with my cousins tho bc I don’t feel like I quite fit in with the grown ups yet (thank god most of my cousins are my age)
And if it’s in a restaurant, than it’s basically the same but we obviously don’t prepare the food ourselves and we don’t play games so it’s usually more formal
Eastern slovak sentence: Tato, ta to ty to tu
Dad, is it you here
Eastern Slovak dialect is like separate language on it's own
Ľudovít Štúr
Anton Bernolák
Milan Rastislav Štefánik
Pavol Országh Hviezdoslav
Alexander Dubček
Maybe some others
Rudolf Vaský.

How could OP forget the most important person in history
Smh my head
I would say for people interested in history, yes he is, but in the general public, probably not so much
This case is like Nikola Tesla 2: Literature Boogaloo
Well I don't like it
We get them a lot in Bratislava on Saturdays, Fridays and it can get wild
I am not really into drunk groups of guys shouting at me as I walk home
As if they think I don't understand them
We also get lot of Austrian, German tourists that come here for that
I don't mind them being on holidays but can they act a little bit better or something
Not jumping into fountains, not shouting at girls
I really do
I do kind of hate my native language because of its complicated grammar and some inconsistencies
I probably make many many many errors while writing in English and double that for speaking, but it still feels better and more consistent
Why would it be scary
>  Like if I say something like "I was walking down the street and I saw a yellow bus with an antenna on it" would that become "I was walking down street and saw yellow bus with antenna" (after writing that out that's kinda how we speak when we do eastern European impersonations)
Well, yes
In Slovak, we do have equivalents of words "some/any" and "this/that/these/those" which are sometimes used in place of your indefinite and definite articles, respectivelly, but usually (I'd guess 70 to 80% of times), there's just no equivalent word there
Us Slavs (apart from the Bulgarian and Macedonian traitors) don't have articles, so it's usually pretty difficult to use something in place of nothing
"If there is not going to be the motorway bratislava-košice in 2010, i will leave politics" - Rober Fico, former slovak prime minister - still in parliament, even though his party is not in government (since last month after 12 years)
Trump is at least very transparent about his wall :D
Classic
Always makes me laugh
Yes, i forgot to write this, of course it is still not done, not even close
It is being build since 70s, it is becoming more of a legend than a real deal
Slovak version of Sagrada Familia
Won't even be finished in 2120
I think very well know
She is from one of the richest families (mafia/oligarchs), shes killed people in car accident - twice, etc
In my view, thats way better scenario than in germany
I am still very confused about the berlin wall, that has to be nuts to see how army just split your city out of nowhere, and it was like 20 years after the war, not immediately
Eastern germany
Obviously the talk about motorway was trough northern slovakia
She hit some people years before this incident in košice, but at that time her family was "untouchable". Even the incident in Hungary spread a of passion in slovakia about slovak "privileged" ones
People were genuinely surprised when she had to go to jail
No one expected that
People thought she will get out of it with their connections in hungary
It is similar (although not the same) here, crossing the border to austria just sitting in nice train and thinking how few years back you would got shot to your back for just thinking of it
How weird it had to be to watch those people on the other side, who were so close yet so far away
As far as i know (i may be wrong), our motorway was proposed to be built in the 70s, funny enough it was supposed to be built by japanese, in exchange for some processing waste from our industry we could not reuse, yet they had the technology
And it was being stopped by USSR, because no imperialistic japanese would harm beautiful socialistic czechoslovakia
And that was pretty much the beginning of this legendary project
Is the airport still under construction
I think that the public opinion on this case in slovakia might be even stronger because of who she is
Because those people act like everything belongs to them
If it was some random slovak person, it wouldnt bring so much attention
Those people are disgrace of our society
Many of them should have been already in jail, even before such incidents
I have literally family members living in Hungary and Austria,, and working in slovakia, they drive every day to bratislava
Both my siblings live in czechia, and also i have many slovak friends living in poland,  austria, germany, switzerland, denmark, nederland, estonia, croatia, spain
And even the language barrier is fading away with youth speaking reasonably good english pretty much everywhere in europe
Some people in slovakia dont understand how convenient it is
For those i suggest to cross slovak-urainian border
It just struggles you how things are different now
It was interesting
People were genuinely surprised that such news even got out in Hungary
Probably police just didnt know who she is etc
or didnt believe her because she was drunk etc
because i am pretty sure she could just buy out hungarian police on the spot (to some degree), people were actually pleasantly surprised, when she went into jail and didnt manage to just get out with probation or something like that
Because her family was stupidly rich with very strong connection, and even that they lose a lot of power, they are still quite powerful
Even to this day
We have a castle [Likava] Well more like a ruin
14th century I think
They do nice events
If not that also [Vlkolinec] aka traditional folk village
In Košice is getting own city coat of arms in 1369
kladivo in Slovak -I feel like the 3 syllables somewhat take the punch away
there's a historic word for smith's hammer, perlík, I don't think it's widely used anymore, and some regional dialects use(d) the Polish loan words mlat and mlatek, and German loan word hámrik used for a small hammer
none of those sound too hammery to me tbh
kladivo
it is pronounced like kla -as clarity
di as divine
vo as voice
Renting a place at 25 is lesa common here than U.S. But what I heard from my age group who are renting, it's very poor in terms of savings
Nice, what would you say is there average salary most people live off in Slovenia
And what are the cost of living
Here in Slovakia if you are in smaller city expect to pay around 300-400€ rent + energies for 3 room flat around 64m and make from 600 to 1000 depending on the field
In Bratislava you would pay around 3000 for a studio around 30-40 m but you d make around 1000 and more also depending on the field you are working in
Prices are after tax
Wow not only we share similar name and flag but also living conditions, I might move to Slovenia for that sea access I miss a lot in Slovakia
You and UK
I have never ever been in such a cold damp houses
Me and my roommate we literally wore jackets inside
Or we used to gather in kitchen because it was smaller and heated easily
First thing my erasmus friends usually did was to buy a heater
Getting out of the bed in the morning was an effort
Italians generally complain a lot about your country
But the truth is, we do like you a lot
1) Yes, im movies
2) No
I kind of do not see the sense in that
I have heard about it, but it's not a thing here since for the most part the spelling is consistent (most part, not always, there are features that make spelling harder, but it's not like the conventional spelling English has)
Bratislava- liberal youth, Asian immigrants (usually Vietnamese and Chinese) owning either an ethnic restaurant or a shop with very cheap products, junkies who usually gather in Pentagon, very snobbish people, rich gold diggers obssesser with plastic surgeries, hipsters, horrible traffic
Nitra- hockey-obssessed drunkards, farmers, poor Gypsies, metalheads & rockers
Southern regions and regions close to the Hungarian border- Hungarian farmers who sell fruits and vegetables at open-air markets for living, people tend to speak broken Slovak with Hungarian accent
Central regions- folk-oriented and sheep-fucking rednecks with funny accents, former neo-Nazis, very religious, a lot of caves and forests
Northern regions- mountains, forests, bears eating trash, Gypsies, unofficial graveyard of Czech and Polish tourists, people often vote for neo-Nazis, drunk shepherds carrying long [axes]
Eastern regions- poverty, Gypsies, crazy and uneducated drunkards, very weird dialects and accents
Also:
Dunajska Streda or Dubajska Streda as in the home of Docasny Slovaks (Temporary Slovaks) and it's region: a country within a country, where there are billboards in Hungarian and most of the events and other stuff is in Hungarian
Don't expect the people there to understand Slovak
Also lots of former maffia members, tax dodgers and stuck up people with fancy cars
Trnava - hard accents, hate Hungarians and they take football too seriously
Kosice - Bratislava of the east, home of the Lunik IX district (gypsy capital) but also of the famous Mojsejovci family (something like the Geissens or Trumps)
Petrzalka - city within a city, the Brooklyn of Bratislava with commie blocks, drug users
Burgenland and Niederosterreich - slowly being absorbed by Slovaks and Hungarians (really, a lot of people move and work there)
Rajka - the new district of Bratislava (sorry Hungary, never meant to offend you)
Pre-pandemic, it was like traveling just to another town in the same country
My mom lives in Austria, my exgf in Hungary, and when I came to a visit, I picked up my gf and went to mom's place, crossing border twice and being in 3 different countries in time span of 30 minutes
Lot of people also live in one country and commute to work/school in another
It's totally cassual, people nowdays seem to completly disregard borders, like they don't even exist
I still don't expect them here
Those are pretty much all over Turkey, Arabic countries and South East asia
I have seen those in Slovakia, in "commieblock" apartments
But definitely not common
At least something you can say is "free and public" in U.S.
How often do your hear people justifying their choice in election by the argument, that at least it is not the other candidate in the first place
Assuming there are only two individuals, or two major political parties/coalitions
Basically the only reason our current government has been elected is because they weren't SMER or ĽSNS
Yes, I suppose there is *that* political party, fed by hate of some few people and hated by the rest, in every country
Hmm, is there a communist party in Portugal
I wonder how Portugal would have looked like, had it been a part of the eastern bloc
How come despite the way the government handled the crisis (especially the first wave), PSOE still keeps being the biggest party at least according to the election polls
In Slovakia our prime minister's party has already fallen off a cliff (from 25 to 15%) and our situation hasn't even been that bad in comparison to many EU countries
I'm sad for both of you
" Some people will fly trough the small roads" ...  "at 60 km/h" heh I mean yeah thats pretty flying trough, if you are looking at it from the train going the same speed and opposite direction
People here drive faster than that on curbs/bicycle lanes
Everybody should drive depending on their driving skill
If you know how to drive fast, and dont care about the potentional fine, drive like that
If you are a new driver dont endanger people around you and drive safely
This rule apply most of the time, so there are plenty of people going 130 on a 70km/h road that can barely fit two cars, and same ammount of people who go 90km/h on a highway
Short answer: yes
Longer answer: yeees
In depth answer: There is a culture in Slovakia about hating your job
It doesn't matter what it is, you need to bitch about it at least a little bit
Unpaid overtime does not exist in here
Paid overtime is paid too well (state mandated) to be broadly affordable for employers
Your shifts ends at 16:30
That means 16:29 you are waiting to sign off and go home
Also not sure if the whole Slovakia does that or just my gymnasium, but each year after their pre-graduation party the soon-to-be graduates would walk around school and go into other classes, sing Gaudeamus Igitur and throw candies
Smaller kids loved it
Brno feels probably the most foreign for students
It’s very weird when you hear Czech there sometimes
But the most foreign feeling at home
probably Dunajská Streda or Komarno, because the majority of the speakers don’t speak  Slovak or they don’t speak or well, so when you go there as a Slovak you’re often looked at as If you were an alien
As for most familiar that would be all Slovak cities probably because they all look alike
Most of Slovak cities and towns feel very similar to each other
For example [Banská Bystrica] just because it's in the very centre
I've just remember Svit, a town built as a workers' colony for [Baťa shoe factory] Not too foreign, but [the style of houses in not common here] (even though the "sun rays" style fences scream THIS IS SLOVAKIA)
No issues I’ll gladly explain
The group doesn’t only speak the minority language, they do speak Slovak but these towns vastly prefer to speak Hungarian
We have some pretty great minority laws, which guarantee them the same status as Slovak in towns where the majority population is Hungarian or etc, so they can have official communication/schools and such in their language
So yes, the central government does make the effort to do that
Yes, of course, it's just that Partizánske has outgrown the original "Bata town" significantly, so I picked Svit
Best video ever, no joke
You conveniently left out your beyond ridiculous number pronunciation system
> rational langage
>English and French
pick one
A lot of languages has it, it is useful
1848 flashbacks
There is a band from Russia that sings in finnish precisely because noone can understand that
They are called Kauan, they are pretty cool
I think " stvrdnúť " (to get hard) is the most extreme example, at least based on my personal research
Electing Vladimír Mečiar in 1990s. Even today some scandals are echos of a situation he created
Ehmmmm
Same here
I had lived in Helsinki as a teenager before I moved back to CE
Back then, as a teen, I did not really have any issues and coped with it perfectly, same went for the long summer days
I visited Helsinki 2 years ago as a tourist during the summer, now being an adult I completely struggled with the summer night
At one moment, I felt completely tired and sleepy, confused why as the sun was still high up, but then it made sense looking at the watch as it was close to midnight
Then, you want to sleep, but somehow you can't completely shade out the sun in your hotel room and you just struggle sleeping, because outside it looks like its still day
I then opened the minibar and started drinking
Just 48 degrees, but we usually deal with it by turning on light
Here the sun sets down at 3 (behind the mountians), i i do not like it very much
I honestly have big problem with winters, all this cold weather, being dressed like an astronaut, always dark
it just doesnt work for me personally
I gotta agree
What the fuck is Hungary
What infrequented word from a foreign language, that you barely speak, have you impressed a native with
I surprised an Italian in a bar once, by knowing what "cieco" meant (blind, a homophone with Czech), as he wanted to tell me about the Italian dad joke ("I met a blind man
"/"Are you sure he wasn't Slovak
"), which I had picked from Reddit
Also, even though my German is so poor that even when I order food in restaurants, and I make myself clear that I'm just trying practice it a little bit if they kindly let me to do so, waiters better switch to English, I remember an English conversation with a German, when I wasn't so sure about the English word for a health insurance card and from a spot deep, deep in my mind, I pulled out the word "Krankenversicherungskarte", which blew his mind, and so did mine, to be honest
At one point, I could recite the Revelation of St
John in Swedish ("Och när Lammet bröt det sjunde inseglet, uppstod i himmelen en tystnad som varade vid pass en halv timme
") because of a monologue from the Bergman's film The Seventh Seal, which sounds pretty cool, but I forgot most of it
Igor Matovič (Slovak PM) posted on his Facebook recently, that he had met Merkel in Brussels and she had been able to tell him "Ďakujem za kvety
" ("Thank you for the flowers"), which had blown his mind on spot, and so would mine
If I were a chick, you'd have me at "Zmrzlinový".
Sorry, my mother, who also doesn't speak Russian in practice, went into a nursing school, where they had some classes in Russian, she memorized it this way and taught me
But don't you worry, I'll reprimand her for you the next time I see her
The next time I visit Greece, I must try to order gyros, tris, to see if I get gyros, tetrakis
How old are you
I'm asking because by my standards, at the age of 25 at latest, one should be able to swear in most European languages including Finnish, and not feel too special about that
I have randomly happened to know the word for bat in Serbian is šišmiš, but it hasn't got me any date yet :(
Very credible, I just remembered how impressed I was with a French guy at work, who used the term miniscule instead of lowercase
I have never learned Serbo-Croatian, but as I can understand what you have written, I believe you are close enough
Eric Cartman, is that you
I have been told "Serbo" is a homophone with the word for stash
What wordplays on that have Italian dads invented, if I may ask
Help, please
I just remembered there is probably some Hungarian swear phrase, that goes like \[azangyalat\], which I've heard only some Slovaks say, immitating Hungarians, but I can't look it up on Google, to figure out how exactly is it spelled (or divided) and what does it mean
Does it really exist
It should, because I remember I was playing table football in Budapest, with some random guys, we were talking in English, but I chanted the word when I let the other team score a lame goal, and those guys started laughing
Not in this case, I think the sentence in Russian would be "Spasibo za tsvety" (?)
Sorry, then
I am just getting a bit disappointed, that most replies involve perkele / kurwa / caralho / merde, etc
I was hoping to learn about some really oddly specific foreign words and explainations, how did people learn them
Anyway, I'd like you to know Italian is the second degree, when it comes to Slovak bosses ranting about someone, who did not comprehend their instructions
It goes like: Are you a Hungarian
(a stupid question raised) < an Italian
(the task performed in a way different than the one expected) < a Mongol
(a completely different task performed instead)
Oh yes, the latter is well known too
Meh, I suppose it's just that Mongolia is so far away there is absolutely no chance they'd understand a single word of their instructions
BTW, I remember drinking in a different bar in Italy, in Turin, where I had a pretty good English conversation with the patrons, but the drunkest one of them clearly called me a Mongol in Italian at one point in front of his buddies, assuming I won't notice, thus he instantly proved himself wrong
my grandma worked with mongolian workers who came to CSSR on some kind of socialistic workers exchange programme sooo she could say that and meant them :D :D
Prague is obviously [Vltava/Moldau]
Also, not my city, but Vienna has THE waltz: [An der schönen blauen Donau]
I fully expected this to be the Sandstorm
I'm giving Slovak hospitality
Halušky
I find this to be an urban legend for the most part
Compared to many other countries I've been to, we seem to be mostly unwelcoming, albeit not all of course
Honestly Stonehenge was such a disappointment for me personally
I've been there a few years ago and was excited to see those gigantic mysterious boulders that people just can't seem to shut up about
Turns out they're not quite as
Gigantic
I mean they're certainly big, but from everything I've ever heard about them, I expected so much more
[rohlík] a long bread roll you can buy anywhere in Slovakia, Czech republic and Hungary but basically nowhere outside of those countries, which is horrible, because it costs less than 10 cents and is perfect for sandwiches
Excuse me if I don't have the need to deep fry myself every thursday
I fucking love German soft drink culture, with the glass returnable bottles and selection of drinks, just fits my taste perfectly
Here people don't bother with glass since they're lazy and don't give a fuck about the environment, they will rather throw away tons of plastic (granted a lot of it is gonna be recycled but still)
Cunts
Don't you have like a smoking and non smoking areas
IMHO it's the way to make both groups happy to allow restaurant owners to have a separated smoking area max the size of the non smoking area
Wait what this isn't normal elsewhere
You kinda already did
Further proof Portugal is Slav, we sometimes eat potato salad mixed with rice with our holiday schnitzel
ok well I am usually buying them in lidl :D yes, bakery rohliky are a bit more expensive
"olovrant"
The word is nonsense in Slovak yet we use it
I thought it's French or something but apparently no
It's mostly meant for kids in school to eat between breakfast (7:00) and lunch (13:00) at about 10-11:00
Try this next time: third fanta, third coke, third carbonated water
Tastes the same minus the diabetes
Centuries of foreign rule does that, we share like half our meals with Hungary, other half with Czechs and our desserts speak Austrian German
On 1st ot September 1939, two armies invaded Popand, starting WW2
German and Slovak
Slovakia was also only country that paid Nazi Germany to export Jews into death camps
But we kinda wiggled the tail and like "not mention" things that happened until 1944 when army and partisans revolted against fascist regime
People always forget you exists Malta, so you are good
Because Hitler said so
As well as Czechoslovakia didn't technically exist
You weren't alone in that mess
> but sadly vast majority of czechoslovaks still wanted communists in charge
Nah
Only in Czechia they won
In Slovakia they lost
To converted fascist-party members, but hey, its not like there was much for pickings
Yes
They are usually filled with [apricots] or plums or strawberries, but I have seen some with just a jam and/or "tvaroh" (like cottage cheese)
They come either with breadcrumb and sugar and butter, but there can be used also poppy seed or cocoa powder or nuts instead of breadcrumb
Do you have "buchty na pare" in czech republic
They are more puffy, and also they usually do not contain whole fruit, only jam or chocolate if anything
I loved them as a kid
Marhuľa in Slovak
Usually whatever’s nearby, but preferrably Kebab in a wrap (Dürüm/Yufka/...)
And then I go back to that bar cause it’s too early to call it a night
I wake up and realize it was just a dream
Also I gotta pee
Or, if you are in Turku, you go to that yellow shack for some makkaraperunat
Spiš castle maybe
Bratislava castle or Bojnice castle
I don't know which is more important
But I guess UFO bridge is also pretty unfirgetable landmark
If we are to compare it to eifell tower in paris I'd stick with UFO bridge in Bratislava
Not very historical but rememberable
Probably [Bratislava Castle] since it’s well known
Nothing comes top-of-mind though
I’m not from Vienna but been there a couple of times since I live in nearby Bratislava, when I think Vienna I think Schonbrunn, Prater, Rathaus, Opera House, ... This the first time I’m hearing about that cathedral
Cathedral in Košice
Never visited the others but man, the palace in Split is amazing
Whenever we spend holiday in HR, usually on islands, I always take Jadrolinja to Split and wander the streets of Split endlessly
Now I know it almost as well as my home town
I love the famous statue, the buzz at the port, I hate the McDonalds in Joker shopping mall, love your new business district, the pedestrian zones near the bus terminal in city center, all the small little shops and streets full of life
družba in levice
lol
When I think about it maybe cause I live nearby (an hour away by car, bus or train) I never went there for a typical “sightseeing” multi-day tour I plan for myself like when I visit other foreign cities, I just always went for a specific one day trip, like we had school trips to prater or schonbrunn and the zoo, since I’m out of school I went there for a couple of business trips, and in winter we sometimes go with friends to christmas markets or iceskating in front of the rathaus, and I know some friends use to go to the opera but I’m not much of an opera/theater fan so I never went with them
Also I’m not religious so I’m not one of those people who actively seek out the biggest church in any city they visit (I have a couple of friends like that, not sure how common this behavior is elsewhere)
I have a cheap mountain bike that cost 300€ the requirements I have for the bike are basically only functional brakes and I´m satisfied
When it comes to the traffic, getting a driving license helped me to understand how to behave on the road, in my country (idk it´s probably the same in a majority of the EU) when you´re cycling on the road you basically count as a car and when you walk by your bike you´re a pedestrian
But I mostly ride on the less frequented/field roads
Slovak nazi state (WW2)
Slovakia today (1993-)
Czechoslovakia also sort of counts
If you count being free as being in two-nations country then we have been free since 1918
If not, then there are two periods
1939-1945 First Slovak State
Although we were german satellite
1993-today's Slovak Republic
century - 906/7 - Great Moravia
1918 - 1938 - Czechoslovakia
1945 - 1948 - second Czechoslovakia (still had free elections)
1989 - present
true
Czechs were independent for far longer
even Great Moravia was czechoslovak
> Sofia
For me the same, even my hometown of 80k people has more to offer
The whole Sofia is just one street with a few bars and commieblocks
It is usually better to check particular vanues/places upfront
But there won't be real nightlife like in NY or so
This but not in a city filled with tourists and scammers selling souvenir shits
Try Brno
And that’s Germany
In Slovakia cheapest shots in cheapest bars can go below 1€.
Well if anything is below 1€ it’s usually from some bottle that costs around 3-5€ when buying wholesale
(Cheap local vodka or flavored vodka) so there is still around 50 cents of profit per single shot
And these cheap AF prices are usually in smaller pubs outside capital city where wages are low and there is usually only one bartender
3€ for a shot of alcohol that cost €25 is a pretty good price
In many parts of Europe you pay that for a shot of Absolut Vodka or other €10-€15 bottle
In Slovakia the traditional shots were 5cl but recently most bars switched to 4cl
But we still put 8cl+ into Long Islands (gin, tequila, vodka, rum 2cl each)
In college I knew a couple of guys who used to start the night with quad shots and know a bar that only serves doubles after midnight and has discount on triple shots
In slovak it’s pronounced either as /ɦ/ or /x/, depending on where in the word it is
I'll visit Constantinople only as a member of Holy crusade
We use: “v Tramtárii/Trantárii” which is a made up country or a remote place
It has more of a negative meaning though
Edit: Seems like the Czechs use it too
Bruh sound effect #2
There is a saying here that "veverička" (squirrel) is called that because when it runs it bounces its bottom: "veje riťka"
Obviously, this is wrong, but the funny thing is there is a grain of truth in there
Veverička (as you've probably noticed) has similar form in many other languages and that's because it's derived from proto-indo european reduplication of root 'wer', meaning 'to turn'
not surprised about you guys
even we have many words which are linked with ancient gods and mythology of yours, I imagine your vocab must be full of it
I wouldn't consider 27 years a long time
My MA group in Uk was from 22 to 55 and it was amazing
Small class, cca 20 people and it made us very close
The age didn't matter at all
So yep
You stop giving shit about age after yoy stop being a teenager
Nitra - fraction distillation of liquified air, mostly
Hlohovec, comes from a plant called Hloh (quickthorn, thornapple, may-tree, whitethorn, hawberry)
Name is mostly derived from the local Earl's surname
Village of the royal fishermen and fishnet makers
You do realize it sounds very phallic, though
Masaryk University in Brno is the best Slovak university hands down
Awesome professors, interesting classes and the city itself is incredibly international
Love it there
Notable mention to Charles's University in Prague too
wait
half-eagle
which half and do your eagles swim
How about Vesihiisi
why am I thinking of mermaid-ish shapes tho
I somehow have it in my mind that sirens are these booby half-fish ladies, the singing and luring ships onto rocks so they can eat the sailors is the same
Todellakin
glad it's not just my brain making stuff up
also, any reason to paint nudes is obviously a good reason -even if it's to depict man-eating monsters
thank you, so I'm not going crazy yet
Anything related to top secret military installations, army capturing and researching UFOs or advanced military research
Our government has barely enough money to maintain 16000 men strong force with outdated Russian equipment, so there is no chance we would have Area 51 or stuff like that
I remember there was one (obviously American) movie in which terrorists have stolen top secret chemical weapon from Slovak military base and then kidnapped a train, I was almost laughing on how far away from reality that movie was
I remember watching some spelling bees competition in TV when I was a kid, and since it was dubbed into a slovak, I was like - are they stupid for having competition as that, must be so easy its literally spelt how it's said
I mean, it's not possible to do something like that ourselves, but it is plausible if Americans payed it with their own money
I heard there was some CIA facility in Poland too
Well that's also the thing
He would not need to refuse the money because of his ego, because the government would pay for the treatment
He would have completely different mentality
So no need of his previous partner to get involved
Plus they would already be getting some social money for their disabled kid
Could you give me please an example
I mean, I understand Czech, but can't for the life of me distinguish the dialects
Are these supposed to be enforced this way
I remember someone telling me that there is some cross-border toleration within EU for some of these "must-have" equipment in car between countries, as in if you are clearly a foreigner with foreign license plates from another EU country, if you car meets your domestic regulations, you are fine
I don't know how much of this is true though
I remember failing in behaving the correct way in Austria for couple of seconds before I realized "oh, this is what's happening
" I was driving on the highway and near a major exit, traffic started to get heavy and suddenly lots of cars went to the right shoulder
My assumption was that they are going to be exiting right soon and are just nice enough to use the shoulder so as to not block traffic going straight, as this is often done this way in Slovakia
So I continued going in the right lane, which was completely empty, but as the road was curved, I didn't know how far
Couple seconds into it, I'm being honked at from both the left lane and the shoulder lane, that's when it hit me and yeah, safety corridors in Slovakia are not in the middle, but on the hard right shoulder
Yeah that's what I thought
In Slovakia we have pirohy (same recipe as Polish pierogy), where the most popular filling is [bryndza] sheep cheese
We also have [bryndzové halušky] , which are sort of dumplings, but more like gnocchi - heavy on potatoes, that are soaked in bryndza cheese
We would top both dishes with smoked bacon
I'm confused by the kex issue -what pronunciation options are people disagreeing on
Greece, my goal is to save money to buy tiny house in Crete
I fell in love with Tenerife when I was there for two weeks because the people were very nice and carefree and apparently the weather is nice most of the year (I prefer temps 15-25)
I also love the culture and people of the US, but I probably wouldn’t want to live there too long because of their ridiculous levels of capitalism
I love nice friendly people who don’t have problems with foreigners
Tbh, we already got EU-passports
However, just like eurocoins, they got some national markings
I don't think they have anyone clever who knows about geography at customs in USA
I get a blank stare when I say where I am from
Hlava, ramená, kolená, palce
Kolená, palce, kolená, palce
Hlava, ramená, kolená, palce
Oči, uši, ústa, nos
Translation is the same as in English except there's added knees and toes line
I was writing a list but I hit the reddit post length limit
Definitely ex-PM Robert Fico
Hopefuly he goes to jail soon
Super markets in USA are huge
They have everything plus 20 times more
Lots of types of products, however also same products that pretend to be different, aka 30 types of cereals, and so on
To me its kinda wasteful and not very ecological
For example Walmart is a freaky place to go to, its as big as hangar
And the people there
I know lot of American who don't want to shop at Walmart
But Target is nicer
I think from the all, Traders joe was my favourite
It looked smaller and the products looked less wasteful and were nice
But for example in California they also have more variety in vegetarian burgers and lots of avocado so that works for me
The thing is, the coffe bar culture that we have in Europe, especially is some countries that take it to perfection as France and Italy, they don't really have it
It mostly just bars and you have to show and ID to get there
Also the bars are the beaches as Venice, long beach or Ocean or Pacific beach have some nice bars, but funny thing when you want to sit down and just enjoy it, you get constantly bothered by the server who either wants you to order a lot or get off because more customers means more tips
So sitting on a terrace is hard sometimes
I miss cafe bars a lot
Its my favourite place to go in Europe
To tell you the truth I absolutely love Pacific and Ocean beach and San Diego the mood there is really nice
However what was interesting was there was a lot of houses directly at the boardwalk
When you wanted a bar you had to go to a alleyway nearby
There were a few bars directly at the beach, but not that much, I guess the price must be huge
Lots of people in those expensive looking houses barbequing and just chilling with a beer looking at the sea
So that's the leisure
As a contrast to it you have cote d azur beaches which are just full of caffees and small shops and boulangeries, because French and their cafes
But there, no cafes
Unfortunately I am a coffee addict, so
However I have no idea how Florida beaches look like, so maybe better, not sure
But I imagine they are cocktail bars
San Diego basically saved USA in my eyes, great chill culture, good coffee (had good expresso with chilli and chocholate Mexican style) and amazing 50 cents tortillas
Would not mind having one of those houses at the beach
100% would open a cafe
I feel we might be just on the edge of making it in  Czechia and Slovakia without most of the problems you described for Baltics and Southern states, unless governments in near future fck up
Population is not declining, we've seen less Slovaks leave abroad than those who came back recently
We do have issues, wspecially the industry being too automobile focused, so there is a single point of failure for the economy
We recently got thousands of Serbians coming to Slovakia for work
As for overall birth rate vs death rate, it's more or less net 0, so we are seeing only slight increase in population as immigration currently > emigration
The median age is however increasing, but I think that's the case for most of Europe
Lol, as a guy from Slovakia, it sounds like a compliment
What the hell
It's weird that I instantly knew who said that quote (without hearing it before and before finishing your sentence)
It's like that doofus has some special, distinguishable type of speech
If they pay taxes here, they should definitely have the right to vote regardless of whether they are EU/EEA citizen or even someone outside of the EU/EEA
In certain cases I would even allow it to non-tax payers as well (e.g. pensioners) if they are registered permanent residents
I would hate to lose my voting rights in Slovakia
While I moved abroad 12 years ago, I am very engaged in Slovak politics
I am subscribed to 2 newspapers, 1 weekly, half a dozen podcasts, and arguably more engaged than an average Slovak voter
I *love* Slovakia, and hope to return one day, but as a gay man married to another man, the political situation does not permit me to do so in a way that would retain the recognition of my marriage
So I vote, and hope that’ll change
With whom could I troll Finland, specifically
You can hope
But from what I gather, this situation will not change here for a long time
Even the younger generation is quite conservative
Although according to the ECJ, marriages done within the EU should be equally recognised across the EU, doesn't matter if gay or not
Whether that truly applies in practice I don't know
This is pretty interesting to hear, because in Slovakia the foreign voters skew heavily towards liberal parties
In our last election, our most liberal party got 33% of foreign votes, but in total didn't get enough votes to get to the parliament
Although we only had 3825 foreign votes, that's like 0
1% of all votes so it's totally irrelevant
Soviet  socialism was all about giving people what they needed
Bot a thing more though
So, life was not bad
Just not good either
Not only speaking freely, the whole culture gets screwed and twisted
**"It's a spanish village to me"** - having no knowledge about a topic
**"I'm coughing on it"** - don't care about it
Well, Slovaks and Czechs understand each other without any major difficulties
People in southern Poland understood me when I spoke Slovak to them and I understood them when they spoke Polish to me
It requires more concentration, but it’s doable
I, personally, don’t understand Ukrainians, but when it comes to Russian, I could probably get by with a really simple conversation
I also speak German on B1 level, I am terribly shy when it comes to using it though, so I usually just go with English in other countries
Sadly no hungarian is a really weird language
In Slovakia I sometimes even don't know where one country ends and other starts
Usually a see a sign in Polish Hungarian and Czech and I am like oh we crossed
Super easy
What borders
simple, depends on the place and country, usually if you take a wrong rural road you end up in a different country, if you go by a big road they just ask you for passport and let you go within a minute
well, you usually get a message on your phone and that makes you notice :D
Damn true
I learned to ignore the messages very easily
yes I do, three of them each time, a friend of mine call it "the holy trinity"
We usually get basic survival info
Where the embassy is located, emergency numbers and so on
I've never seen pricing details
Great beer
Huuungary
Czech Republic and Hungary mostly

Englishman, Irishman and a Scot have a round together, when three flies fall into their beers
Englishman disgustedly turns away the glass
Irishman takes the fly out and continues drinking
Scot takes out the fly and yells at it "spit it out, SPIT IT OUT
23C right now @ 41% humidity
22-23 is my preferred temperature range for living (not too hot, not too cold)
Inside I consider below 20 as too cold and above 25 as too hot
Also I consider below 40% humidity as too dry air and above 60% humidity as too humid air
Maybe they are men
Dunno
But I have been in a lot ac battles when living with male roommates
Or in offices
23, 5 is perfect for me
21 is a gotta have a sweater and thick socks
Under 20 i will be hugging the radiator and put a coat on
So I read on it and thought the typical office temperature was made for men in 60ties wearing full suits
So I just believe women like it warmer and work better when they are now to shivering from the cold
So generally iys believed women like it warmer and 23 is perfect for us because our bodies retain heat differently
I walked all over Slovakia at night
Never really had a problem
I like walking
I walk a lot
Plus when drunk it helps me to sober up
My hometown is boring, small nothing much happens
Sometimes when I walked home from a pub, I had police car stop by and ask me if I wanted a lift
In Bratislava its pretty normal, at night everyone was walking to their own bus stop at night and then walking home alone
And yep I am a woman too
In Slovakia we have the [Fujara] it is kind of a giant flute
[this is how it sounds]
A music to my ears
The city of skalica has been one of the 3 centers of fight against Magyarization in Slovakia and has been the capital city of Slovakia for like, 6 days in 1918
For my hometown either the ottoman occupation (it was originally an anti-Ottoman fortress, withstood 6 sieges, but ultimately it fell) or the bombardment during WW2 (most bombarded town in Slovakia because of important railroad, more than half of houses were destroyed)
I think Greek people can just flex with the amount of historical events their cities had
Poděbrady and Nymburk
Remember, remember the 5th of November
However unlike in ww1, this cavalry charge was very much successful
I don't know if we have something similar with any Slovak writer, maybe Andrej Sládkovič, author of the longest love poem in the world, and his museum and the unique Love Bank in Banská Štiavnica
But his work is already public, iirc
In visual arts, we have a big Andy Warhol Museum of Modern Art in Medzilaborce, near the hometown of his parents
His brother Paul used to be present there before he passed away
Andy's foundation based in New York is represented in Slovakia by the author company LITA
more (sea)
jar (spring)
mince (coins)

hate (weirs)
gate (pants)
cap (male goat)
dub (oak)
pole (field)
mole (moths)

Some more which came to my mind:

* sob (reindeer)
* cop (plait)
* rub (back side, e.g. of a playing card)
* hod (throw \[noun\])
Also Slovak language uses declination, that means the word can have different ending when used in different situations
That opens the space for some other words:
* bite (you **fight** \[plural\])
* byte (in the **house**)
* dupe (he/she/it **clamps**)
* cope (in the **plait**)
* rite (plural of the word **ass**)
I would add also that some words from OP also exist in Slovak, 2 of them with slightly different meaning:
* do (into)
* no (informal yes)
* on (he)
* to (that)
* ten (this)
* brat (brother)
* list (letter or leaf)
* pasta (paste)
My arabic ex - the pooping business
Bidets and not bothering him
My American boyfriend, the ice and the ever present cold AC
So much ice everywhere
I have gotten so sick when I first got to his place because of the ACs in USA are being set as a stand in for an ice age
And every drink  is basically a cup full of ice with a little bit of drink in it
His favourite complaint about Europe and vice versa my complaint about USA is we walk too much (he likes it now, I did my public transport duty), bad services in restaurants (I hate tips he loves it) and no ice in drinks
And our lack of PDA in some places IN Europe
Also I feel like Usa is much more into that fake plastic appearance, but that may be just California thing
Omg exactly
My ex was arabic, and to say I learned so much about a sacred art of proper pooping
He even had an portable bidet
Also could never ever barge on him doing his business
As contrary to my current SO who could not careless if I talk or stare at him while on the toilet
To be fair, I freaking love bidets they need ti become a thing everywhere
*disagrees in Slovak*
TBH, the viszegraád 4 are not really east nor west europe
To me those 4 countries are the central Europe
In northwest Slovakia
A small factory  or a big house with big piece of land, nice car and still have a lot of money to save
Either a mansion or several houses / flats
Maybe one bigger house / apartment in capital city or two smaller ones
Don’t use taxis, especially the ones that park near main station and wait for customers
Use Uber or Bolt, the prices are much cheaper
(Sometimes 3 vs 30€ if you find a proper scammer)
Don’t enter restaurants in city centre where a guy standing in front is handing out menus and calling you in
These apply for all cities in Eastern EU, seen and heard of these in Bratislava, Prague, Budapest and couple of cities on Croatian and Bulgarian coast
You are so right, I've been in Pisa for a few days and man i was bored as FUCK, everything that's worth seeing you can see in one day spent most of my trip there just lying on the grass in the shade cause it was nice and cool in the stupid summer heat
Good thing that I had train tickets to several other cities in the region or otherwise I would be really dissapointed with my trip
No hate towards Pisa, its a nice city, but there is not much things to do, loved the We love Pasta restaurant tho
We have way to describe both, for to me unknown reasons, in SK language you can count from first or first floor up:
Prvé podlažie - first floor (the street level)
Prvé poschodie - first floor (the next one)
Same in Slovakia
The floor on street level is called “Prízemie” and the first upper level we call “Prvé poschodie” (first floor)
However, ironically, in my building we have the ground-floor marked with 1 in the elevator, because the building was designed by an Israeli company (and to my knowledge, in Israel they have a similar system as in the USA where the ground-floor is considered 1)

Actually we are really good at naming things
Comes from the fact we are from the middle of Europe so we are not limited by one language and can borrow some words/namings from neighboring countries and "slovak" them
Just our capital is named Bratislava which means Brother's glory or Celebrate brotherhood
We have Zvolen which could (my speculation) be translated to Evering or Bánska Bystrica could be roughly translated to "A clear stream near a mine"? Really depends
If ya want some boring generic name Slovenský Kraj literally means Slovak Region, luckily that's the only one I can think about
We have a place called Horny Bar
Yes, Horny Bar
In Slovak it means something else, but in english it's laughable
Nové mesto nad Váhom (New Town over Váh - a river)
I really love some of our region and urban naming, though street names are poor
I love names like Telgárt, Horehronie, Tatry, Nitra or Bratislava
Unfortunatelly some names that were changed recently , like Partizánske (partisans town) or Slovenské Nové Mesto "slovak new city" that is a village
Also id translate Banská Bystrica "mining creek"
Funny is, that Zvolen and Banská Bystrica  are 20 km apart and German names are Altsehl (old Zvolen) an Neusehl (new Zvolen)
Also in my mind are cities an villages on Liptov
They are literally names - Liptovský Mikuláš (Liptovish Nicolas), Liptovský Jakub (Liptovish Jacob), Liptovský Ján (Liptovish John) etc
Names after weekdays - Spišský Štvrtok (Spiš Thursday), Spišská Sobota (Spiš Saturday), Dunajská Streda (Danube Wednesday), Rimavská Sobota (Rimavan Saturday)
But for me are funniest city names after near objects - Modrý Kameň (Blue Stone), Červený Kameň (Red Stone), Cinobaňa (Tin Mine), Lúky (Meadows), Nová Baňa (New Mine), Senohrad (Hay Castle) and best of all, Kuchyňa (Kitchen)
Nové mesto nad Váhom
Yeah, also in slovak language, district city Nové Zámky (New Castle)
Parody content like memes and parody videos are not included in this ban
So, it's not as bad, in my opinion
Its just overblown here in Reddit
Noone I know irl cares about it (even in IT circles)
Well, they have 2 years to implement it right
I think we all remember how everyone started talking and doing something about GDPR just right as it was coming into effect
Read this:
&#x200B;
The information in media is very one sided
Always look on both sides of the coin
&#x200B;
I did precisely the same, for some reason I love military marches (be it German ones, French, Russian, Polish, Romanian)
I feel really weird because I personally don’t know anyone else who listens to it, but I am grateful that a fellow Reddit stranger does it as well
Anyway, I got to it through EU4, since I wanted to have a thematic music
I do indeed, one of the best channels for this type of content
One that comes to my mind is if you say something and don't want to jinx it, you should knock on something wooden and say "I have to knock".
Similarly, if you say something and don't want to jinx it, it's also quite common to say (usually beforehand) "I don't want to paint devil on the wall" (in Slovak it's not devil but "čert", devil is probably the closest translation)
Another superstition is for babies to have something red attached to the baby stroller, often a red ribbon (or to wear something red, but not near the head)
It's supposed to "catch" bad looks ("bad eyes") from other people, these looks are believed to be harmful, even induce illness or death
The red colour is supposed to attract the look
This is very common, I think some people do it just because of family habits and don't know the original meaning
Not sure if these are specific to Slovakia
Black cat crosses your way = Spit 3 times on a ground or a VERY bad event happens
Break a mirror = bad luck
Plate falls down and breaks = good luck
When you say something and don't want to jinx it, you should knock on something wooden asap
Stepping into an animal shit = good luck (or maybe bad
not sure)
The alcohol laws are the reason why I'd never want to live in Sweden
I like my booze
Amen, brother
Same here
The prices are too high as well, the non-existence of some alcohol brands (especially spirits like borovička) as well
Well, the west hates the east, the east hates the west, so I think the neutral zone is somewhere in the middle
It would be Banská Bystrica for me
Probably the central North
But dont we all love the mountains
Its kinda in the middle so it connect us
That's right
Tatras for the win
Honorary mention to Staré hory
in practice, of course yes, I do have guy friends as well as girl friends (well, maybe more girl friends than the guys, but still), but yes, there are people that keep saying that they don't believe in friendship between men and women, that there is always something more
to this my bisexual friend responded "so with this logic I can't be friends with anyone
" which I think is a pretty appropriate reaction
It's extremely common
I'm a Hungarian from Slovakia and from my experience yes, girls and boys can definitely be friends
Maybe it's just my generation, but boys and girls have always been able to enjoy friendships with each other
True, sometimes people assumed that there was something between them, but that was mainly from the older generation
My friends and me have always had a mixed group of friends, it was never exclusive to just one gender
Prosím(Please) - is the most common
If the number is unknown, you can add your surname as well
If it is someone you know(depends who it is) - Yes/Hi/Good Day
"prosím" (please), + surname
sometimes I add "áno" (yes) in the beginning
I answer the calls of my friends and family with "čau / ahoj / nazdar / serus" (hi), sometimes with "áno" as well
“This is Michal” - I think it comes from years I worked as a customer support agent at my college’s help desk, where I’d pick up with “Colorado College Helpdesk, this is Michal”.
In Slovak, I’d say it’s split between “Áno
” (Yes
) and “Haló?” (which is specifically a greeting used on phones and nowhere else)
If it’s family or friends, I go with “no lásko
”. I say it so often it’s one of few things my American husband knows in Slovak
Or rather Eastern Slovak
It depends
First known larger Slavic realm was formed here in around 623
Later the Principality of Nitra was formed which consisted of majority of modern day west and central Slovakia
Together with Principality of Moravia they formed Great Moravia in 833
Some sources indicates that even prior this the people in Principality of Nitra considered themselves to be ethnically different from those in Principality of Moravia
However, I guess it's too early to speak of Slovak identity but it's very possible that the differnt Slavic identity which later became the Slovak identity started to form at those times
At some point Great Moravia consisted of modern day Slovakia, Czech Republic, Carpathian Ruthenia, Hungary and some regions of Germany (where Sorbs live), Austria, Slovenia, Croatia and Romania
At this point the first known Slavic letters and codified language were formed (it's possible there were some writing systems before but we don't have a serious proof of it only some indications)
This Old Church Slavonic language was introduced by the pope as a 4th sacred language (a huge thing since the only 3 languages allowed to be used during services and to transcribe bible at that time  were Latin, Greek and Hebrew)
After its fall at around 903 the country split and Principality of Nitra became separate entity again
Together with Hungarians it formed Hungarian Kingdom in 1000 which was meant to be a strong kingdom housing various nationalities
Unfortunately, especially post-1848, Hungarians started to force Hungarian identity as the only state-approved identity
This caused Slovak people to unite and the word Slovak identity started to be used more often even by the common folks as something what unites them against so called Magyarization (forced assimilation and conversion to Hungarian identity which massively failed)
Before that, Slovak people knew they are ethnically and linguistically different from Hungarians but majority still considered themselves to be people of Hungarian Kingdom so the Slovak identity was something I would say secondary to the identity of inhabitant of the kingdom
But as I said this changed post-1848
Finally Slovaks united with Czechs in 1918 into the common country of Czechoslovakia
This was simply because it was easier to stand against former Austrian-Hungarian kingdom together
There was an independent Slovak state formed in 1939 but it's rather unpopular part of our history due to it being puppet state of a nazi Germany
It's questioned whether we had other options tho since either we ended up as German protectorate like Czechia or we are swallowed by Poland and Hungary who both had claims over the territory
Post war we formed Czechoslovakia once again only to be forced into communism due to their popularity in Czechia
Slovakia had major support for democratic party at that point
Anyway, Czechoslovakia ceased to exist at the end of 1992 and independent Slovakia was formed in 1993 again
So well
We consider our modern-day country to be created in 1993
But we also think the separate Slavic identify which later became Slovak identity formed somewhere in 7th century at times of Principality of Nitra
But its hard to say since we didn't have a need to use a separate term till like 17th century as we were usually a part of something bigger
Well Hungary was founded in 895 that was the year they entered this land
Every such shop in here offers vans for rent for very cheap
Or you can get it delivered for slightly more money
Edit: also why is US so obsessed with pick-ups
No matter how big they are it still cant compare to the loading capacity of a van
And as a daily driver its just oversized SUV without a trunk, so you dont have a place for your weekly groceries, unless you transport them in the back
It just seems all in all very impractical
When I was a kid there was an even bigger Skoda (1203) available for these purposes
>Most people who own pickups only occasionally use them to carry heavy/bulky cargo, they're used as passenger vehicles most of the time
So someome buys huge behemont that chugs down gas like it's free, to use it's single advantage only occasionally
Isn't it cheaper to drive some sedan, and rent truck/van when needed
I would go crazy if I had to reguraly drive pickup in my city
There are streets where it can't even drive through or fit in parking spots, and I would spend half my salary just for gas
Heh, I used VW golf several times and I think it's the perfect and most suitable car for my city: it fits everywhere like a glove and doesn't spend too much gas
I envy your parking infrastructure sometimes
Here, finding a spot is like a nightmare; not only in city center, but also on overcrowded suburbs
For example, one of the largest and most important hospitals in the capital city doesn't have a single parking spot, or garage, or any type of parking around it
Interesting "tato" means father in Slovak
Don’t forget about us
No because I was in a sports class and we bypassed these classes for more training
Then in the gymnasium we have no classes as that
Also they are gender separated and I consider it a bullshit
Many people live alone now and it's very useful for everyone to learn how to cook, sew, learn basic plumbing and around the house work
To be fair I am not fan of cooking, but I do it when I have to I just don't enjoy it
I checked and it was 5,759 for Russia and 5,9 for Usa
My mom always make some friends
I usually try to avoid it as much as possible (not by being annoying, more like being neutral - neither a friend and neither an asshole)
If they ask for something I'm usually trying to be helpful, but I'm not actively looking for an interaction
Might have something to do with my introvert nature and that I generally don't want people to be visiting my place
So I think the neighboring etiquette is whatever fits you and your neighbors
I would assume that it's more common to know your neighbors in villages than in the cities where you usually live in condos with possibly several dozens other families in the same building
It could go all ways, friends, enemies, frenemies, strangers
It depends
Depends on where I am
In my hometown I usually use a car, and it takes at least 4 or 5 minutes anywhere I would like to go
During the school year it takes me 2 hours and 30 minutes to get to the town where I study, but that's not a daily commute
In that town it takes me a 15 minute walk or a 3 minute ride on the tram to school
Another 5 or 10 minutes on the tram to work together with a 5 minute walk
15 minutes by bus on when the traffic is good - or 20 minutes by bike when the weather allows it
I actually really like Arabic female names
Layla
Alia
Amira
Jala
And then the nordid sounding names as Einar, Jengwar
And I really like Max or Félix
Kevin and Lena
[Obligatory]
Sometimes never
It's getting harder to get a loan, house and flat prices go up rapidly and we have very few places to rent
At the time when they decide to live on their own (either from their own will or due to e.g. work in different city) or when they are kicked out of the parents' house
It used to be (more or less) a norm to leave at the age of 18-19 in the communist era but it's way more common nowadays to see even 30+ people live with together with their parents due to economical reasons - buying house is quite expensive nowadays and as a remnant of the communist era people prefer to own the house/condo rather than rent it
That means renting is also expensive and hard to find one outside of the bigger cities and even in the big cities the quality of offers is often poor
Also it's common to see multi-generational houses especially in villages
People also sometimes bring their older relatives to live with them
Well in Finland moving out for university is quite different than how we understand it
Even tho they get dorms provided by university, those are usually without furniture and they bring their own stuff there
I was there as an exchange student and we had separate dorms exclusive to exchange students which were furnished
There were no Finns using them
I suppose the prices in Slovenia are similar to ours
In that case, it is 70€ per month
Well I have to mention that the quality of the dorms is .. lacking, to say the least
The walls are very thin, so you can hear nearly everything that happens in the rooms next to, above or under yours
You get a wardrobe, a night stand and a bed
People bring their own bedsheets etc
But wi-fi and food are pretty good
About our universities
there are three decent ones on the European level, the rest range from bad to worse
The best ranked one in Slovakia is Univerzita Komenského in Bratislava (UK), then Slovenská technická univerzita (STU), and Technická univerzita in Košice (TUKE)
But I mean, take into consideration [average salary] when comparing prices
I'm not saying that Dutch dorm rent isn't overpriced, but many seems to forget the income difference when both countries use €.
In the movie Dragonheart (a campy fantasy fairytale with Connery) there is a troupe of foreign dragon hunters
When they are to actually fight the dragon, one of them yells "Nabíjaj, rýchlo rýchlo nabíjaj" - "Reload, quick, quick, reload
Funnily enough, years later my brother actually met the actor
Yeah, I mix it myself from time to time (especially in summer), but I've never seen it sold in a bottle already mixed
After FIFA 19 I hate croquetas so much
Here it's only with women, although it's mostly just the older generations
Same, it's like fries with the shape of ball
Well I can’t decide if it’s desert or proper meal, probably the latter, but I love [perky]
and [makové šúľance]
This reminds me joke we have here: "Austrians are the smartest people on Earth: they convinced whole world that Beethoven was Austrian and that Hitler was German"
Looks like you have same sense of humor as Germans
We don't have many reason to develop better sense of humor, we mostly laugh at our country
Most of the people not as the primary source of heat
But almost every family house has a fireplace and uses it few times of the year
It was good for the nobility, terrible for the common folk
It was more or less standard monarchy with similar development as any other monarchy in Europe
However, the key turn-point was imho mid-19th century when very aggressive forced [magyarization] started
It just led to raise of a strong opposition and separatism movements in regions with minorities and that led into dissolvement of the monarchy post-WW1
Czechs had much better (but still not good tho) place in monarchy than e.g. Slovaks
Most of it comes from a bit more relaxed ruling and treatment of minorities within the Austrian part of the monarchy (where Czechs belonged)
Slovaks were treated differently due to a [magyarization] in Hungarian part
I wouldn't call their situation as "pretending to be a victim" either tho
I feel that separatism in Czechia was more about finally ruling themselves while in Slovakia it was more about getting rid of Hungarians and their oppressive policies
However, I'm surprised he didn't mention Kingdom of Bohemia at all
Is he the same guy from Death Stranding
Me lo voy a poner antes de dormir, su voz es muy agradable especialmente en combinación con la música
También me servirá para practicar mi pronunciación, ya que habla con mucha claridad

Tousty (that's how you call them in slovak)  are tasty af
This is one of the games I as a Slovak person don’t want to play, but okay
Here we go:
We are producing a lot of cars
We are “the voice of reason” in the Central Europe
Like our political situation is a mess, but we at least don’t do stuff that worries the rest of the EU so that’s a win
We are the last bastion of reason, fairly liberal sanity and pro-european democracy in the central-east, surrounded by Poland and Hungary
We also guard the Slovak-Ukrainian border (although some will say not very well) and support Ukraine in their fight with Russia over delivering gas through Russian-Ukrainian pipelines to Central Europe
If Russia cuts Ukraine off, then Central Europe is partially cut off and that is a big problem in the winter
We also build your cars
Volkswagen, Škoda, Porsche, Kia, Jaguar, Land Rover, Peugeot, Citroen, all of those brands have some models being built here
Slovakia is #1 exporter of cars per capita in the world
And we are also a good source of a Slovakian-Slovenian memes
Spain is also doing the EU's dirty controversial work, keeping illegal African migrants away
Mostly the line from Morocco to Melilla
Im so sorry for that
We felt that shit even in Bratislava which is like 350km away
Slovakia has a mint (Kremnica), operating since 1328
Nowadays it mints euro coins, and also coins for some other countries around the world
Yeah I got very anxious when I read the question of this post:D
A mobster currently on trial for ordering the murder of a journalist investigating his shady deals with the government got his stuff confiscated and his chat logs with politicians and judges about how truly corrupt they are and the deep ties to the businesses and mob have with the ruling parties
Next year are elections (unfortunately for them) so hopefully we will cleanse that sewer
Truly fucking horrifying how these assholes basically ran a mob ruled state, we knew before but now there's evidence
Few months ago, a journalist and his bride were murdered
This caused a huge scandal and piece by piece, it was revealed that the ruling party had close connections with mafia, they were dealing with land, extremely corrupted and that the prime minister was in touch with very shady people
The journalists name was Kuciak, and the current guy whos voice records are being investigated today is Kočner if anyone is interested
Ultimately this lead to downfall of the social democeatic party which was in charge back then
It also influenced the presidental elections with social democrats losing to our current president Čaputová
> Orban
This is getting out of hand, now there are two of them
Everytime I travel anywhere east from Tatra mountains or to the rural central region
Or southern part
Or basically everywhere outside capital to be honest
How do you call the brach of government responsible for military
In Slovakia, it is "Ministry of Defense". Are there countries, which label the institution in a way that also suggests the possibility of *offense*?
EDIT: Wow, I can only imagine how much attention would I have got, had I not made a typo in the header :/.
It was called Ministry of war during the first (Czechoslovak) republic
This is quite interesting, that you put sport into the same category as defense and civil protection
Watch out, we have a badass over here (with nukes
In Austria-Hungary, which we were a part of at the time, it was Ministry of War
It does not sound very pacifistic
And there has been no war since
What a lifehack
If I may steer the question a bit, it seems France is currently the only country in the EU, which does not adhere to the "self-defense" naming convention
Doesn't that scare you a little, especially since they are the only country in the EU presently, that possesses nuclear weapons, and considering your mutual history
In this regard, aren't at least some Germans in favour of funding a German nuclear programme, just to seize the opportunity, that you are still getting along with your old nemesis
OK, you may keep the nuclear programme
HEY EVERYONE
LOOK HERE
They want us to think they are all into defense, while secretly, in a cryptic language
Come on, spit it out
Who's the target
Is Lukashenko's intel correct
Are you the NATO representative, planning the invasion
Or is it Kaliningrad oblast of Russia
I think it makes more sense than combining education and sport
I think combining education and sport makes just about the same sense as combining culture and sport, little less sense than combining defense and sport and much less sense than combining it with anything else
However, I find the most sense in creating a dedicated ministry
Guys, please
I can put together a couple of simple sentences in German, but I shiver when I imagine learning French from scratch
I see, but how much is the actual inflation
Or -just out of curiousity- how many $ or € could buy me a small 2-room apartment in the outskirts of a large city
And what would that dedicated ministry do
The fact is that the government is doing minimum for sports and it doesn’t really make sense to do more than that
Sports aren’t a cohesive field and the current system where each sport has its own national-level association which is funded by the ministry is good enough
The only thing I can imagine that the ministry could do more is some sports marketing
I’ve just googled that our gov financially supports over 70 sports associations and I’ve never even heard about 10 of the sports (like wtf is korfbal or boccia) and for another 10 of them had no idea there’s even interest here let alone gov money (we have baseball and petanque in Slovakia
Where
Now that I think about it combining with schools or culture can be a good fit because of the reach they have
Combining with army could make sense if there was overlap between army and sports personal (I can imagine that physical training for army and some sports can be similar)
I didn't assume you were joking; what made you think I did
I am sorry housing is getting so unaffordable for most of you, although it is interesting for me to see, how real estates retain some value, when money is becoming worthless, which is partly why I was asking
As for the other part - I still have a better idea where to settle in, although I'd love to explore Your country one day
Oh, don't You worry, I've studied economics, and I've seen [this] so you can hardly surprise me
I don't drink alcohol and our national cuisine isn't very appealing to me at all (except for 'bryndzové halušky', non-smoked cheese products and few kinds of soups and maybe other dishes I currently can't think of)
Also I am not a fan of hockey or any other sport
Skáče jak Srb - jumping like Serb , meaning someone is aggressive
Čo si maďar - what are you hungarian , meaning if someone doesn't understand you
We have some:
"pere sa ako žid do neba" - his pushing himself like a jew to heaven (when someone is trying to put himself to a spot, like get to the train trough a crowd but also like get a position in company etc
"zničený ako cigánská hračka" - destroyed like a gypsy toy (when one is completely exhausted and doesnt feel well, for example in the morning after heavy drinking)
"pracuje to ako švajčiarske hodinky" - it works like swiss watch (when something works flawlessly)
"fajčiť ako turek" - to smoke like a turkish man (when someone smokes too much)
"čo si maďar
" - Are you hungarian
(if someone doenst understand, or if someone is doing something in very different way than what is custom, for no apparent reason)
"to je pre mňa španielska dedina" - it is a spanish village to me (meaning i cant understand that at all)
"na židáka" - like a jew (meaning if someone is avoiding to pay but takes something out of it, like for example goes to the party, brings nothing but is drinking what others brought)
"russká robota" - russian job (sloppy job)
"raz za uhorský rok" - once in a hungarian year (meaning very rarely if ever)
"mexická/španielská telenovela" - mexican/spanish soap opera (too much drama for no reason)
"zima ako v rusku" - cold like in russia (when it is too cold outside)
"s kľudom angličana" - calm as an englishman (doing something stressful calmly, easily)
"zlaté české ručičky" - gold czech hands (it is being used in czechia as "being handy", here is it being used in ironic way, if someone screw something up)
And not really saying it self, but during soviet era people used to say (and some still do jokingly):"keď klamem, nech sa na miesto do západného nemecka prepadnem" - If i lie, i shall fall on the spot into western germany (as western germany was being pictured as a terrible place, so it was a joke on communists)
We do the same, but we also whip them with a wooden whip to be 'beautiful and healthy' for the next year
I've seen some people doing it here as well, but we call the doll/effigy Morena instead
I have actually heard that Czechs don't do that
At least my friends from Moravia, who said that what we do in Slovakia with sprinkling and whipping girls is a stupid tradition
They do family reunions and dinners instead
Don't know whether that's true for the whole country though
Fuck, that's hot
Why don't we have something similar here
Also, it seems like the gayest sport ever
Wonder what the contestants think while they grab the other one's ass or
you know what
Turkey
you have some explaining to do
King Svätopluk of Great Moravia
I mean yeah, first true king od Great Moravia, expanded his realm to its greatest extend and he did beat just about every neighbor, he even has a statue in front of Bratislava castle
But the more you look into his reign, the worse it gets
He overthrew his uncle Rastislav, who unlike Svätopluk, had stable reign, modernized the realm and got Great Moravia out of Frankish influence almost completely
Besides , Great Moravia fell apart upon Svatopluks death
History would have been very different if Rastislav stayed on the throne
This is fucking hilarious
We did basically the same, but we barely had a choice
That sounds exactly like a perfect answer to this post's question
Idk for example in Slovakia it’s 331 eur
I don’t consider that a lot
Sure it may be for some people, but mostly if you really want it you can afford it
But lots of people either don’t know the price and think it’s much higher or don’t want it because it might make them look pompous
Wow, that’s cheap AF
For example we pay 66 EUR now for new plates when you change your residence into another district, because the plates have your district on them
But thankfully today our government voted on removing this stupid rule so soon it will be history
not corrupted government, february's elections give me last hope for a change
I am the only person I know who writes "Ƶ". I just like it that way
I do that too sometimes with my food so I have my other hand free to do other stuff
A couple of years back, when I was a student, they passed a law that every classroom must display the national flag and the anthem, to "increase national awareness in the youth". I thought it was pathetic
We got nazis in the parliament about the same time I reached voting age
Do you have dirt and trash lying around your house
You've just been outside, youre bringing the shit from there back to your home wtf
But then why did the other person ask me how I'm doing
Why play games
Seems disingenuous to us,if you ask how I'm doing you better be prepared for a tirade about the negative impact of late stage capitalism on young adult's mental health
I always thought it's also because held down, the water in the flower is kept in the head and the lower part dries up first then

Proper bread has a thick, hard crust, almost like a shell, and is soft on the inside
I've never encountered any pre-sliced bread like that
I have these two plastic coins on my keys that I use for it
You can get it in any promo material giveaway
It's like keychains, pens, notebooks, plastic coins for a cart
In most stores here they have a thing that you have to put the coin there and close it, hard to describe
Like this:
So you can't use that
Definitely the [Apollo Bridge] in Bratislava
It looks fantastic, got multiple awards, everyone from Bratislava loves it and is a great contrast to grey communist bridges
The photo is a bit old, there is a shitton of tall office buildings behind it now, so it doesn't look out of place right now at all
Then, since Bratislava got crowned as the 3rd richest EU region, we had to step up our game and a new business district started to get built (called Downtown or historically Nivy)
It's pretty fancy, new tramline, underground bus station, huge futuristic mall, pedestrian bridge across Danube, river swimming resort, and just a good overall architecture with office buildings (most of them are in various stages of being finished)
The building process in that district is pretty aggresive, we finally get our first skyscraper (more than 150m in height) and a ton of almost-skyscrapers
The most notable part of it is [Sky Park by Zaha Hadid] which is almost done right now
It did not disappoint, looks great on visualisations and in person, although the photos I could find didn't do it much favor
It also houses the most expensive penthouse in the city, valued at 1,6M €.
Wow
That's the best one in my opinion here
I really love how they're making great use of the space around these new buildings
My favorite place is the [riverpark] of the Eurovea mall in the centre
They're making some very people and pedestrian friendly choices, which I love
Although Bratislava has always placed a huge emphasis on people ([Ruzinov] is an amazing district with lots of trees, parks and greenery, despite housing tens of commie blocks)
Riverpark is also very good, although it's in a weird place, we don't go there much often since there is only Riverpark and nothing else
Also has a bad rep since a huge corrupt Slovak investment company built it
They also build 50 % of the new downtown, but did a way better PR job there :D
Ružinov is amazing, I lived there for 15 years and couldnt be more happier
Trees, small lakes, all very people-friendly, close to city center
Yes, the communist houses (we call them "Paneláky" or Concrete panel buildings") are there, but it's not a big deal
They are without issues on the inside and since there is ton of parks and tall trees everywhere, and they are also painted very colourfully, you never think of them as a communist building, although they are
No issues with them
If I had to recommend only 1 district, I would 100 % recommend Ružinov, although most of the others are very good as well
I actually think that the Markthal looks pretty cool
I would even say that it’s the best from OP’s examples imo
Yes, it's the only way forward
If we stay fragmented then China, Russia and others would buy every important politician and company and we are fucked
Also, small countries like Slovakia are hugely dependent on bigger countries in Europe in almost everything
So, I would go as far as creating something like the USA in Europe
Closer integration is the key, fragmentation means more corruption and more outside influence
For Czechia it absolutely has to be Divá Bára

But me and my friends wanted to know more about Finland winter war
And we were teaching teacher
Not once did I hear this, although I know all about it as I’m kind of a WW2 buff
The Finns are badass, and smart too
They’d cement busted tanks into the ground as static gun positions
If I recall correctly - not at all
But me and my friends like the topic of WW2 so we read about it
My personal favourite is [Orava castle] Even several movies were made them like vampire classic Nosferatu and the new series The Rules of the Beast
Also Dragon Heart was filmed here
UFO bridge in Bratislava , or upside down pyramid,  that works as Slovak TV and Radio brodcaster
I heard about that, it was ridiculous
It's as if American citizens should get away with crime, like what the fuck
r/Nottheonion at this point
I have eaten homemade schnitzels with bread on trips with my family so many times that I have lost my count
That's like one of the most stereotypical Slovak tourist habits I have heard about
Did you jump into a fountain, wore stupid clothes or overall and sang loudly
It doesn't matter, I have eaten them in bread rolls, regular white bread and even in toast, lol
My most favorite language is probably Polish, but I also really like Czech, Russian, English (especially Scottish dialect), Korean and Japanese
Italian, Spanish and French sound good as well, but not as much as these other languages
My parents / grandparents and uncle used to call me "malý" which basically means smol
We have something similar with “mladý” or “mladej” in a dialect
for very little kids ´´malý´´ and ´´malá´´
small one
you are the small one until you grow into young one
it is not, my native language is taught only on Memrise

yes, it has some cons, yes you do not pay anything unless you want extra features

The part of Slovakia where I live it’s mostly ghost sightings, which is a pretty popular subject throughout the country
For example, Bratislava’s got the ghosts of some corrupt city officials from the 17th century that made a deal with the devil - stories said they’re still haunting a building on the Green Street
Then there’s the White Lady, usually women who died in childbirth, got killed by their husband or were jilted brides
An exception is Levoča’s white lady (real historical figure - Julianna Géczy) - this one they executed
Quite an interesting story though
She’s supposed to haunt several places, which must be very taxing for her, poor one
Here i feel like this is a regional thing
It really depends on the event itself, but generally i would say people bring their bottles, which they open and pour drink to anyone
However having said that, when i lived abroad we have met some czechs and slovaks and organized a party where everybody brought something
Yet those slovaks were just opening random bottles and pouring drink around, which surprised me to the degree when i had a culture shock of my own people
So i dont know if that is a regional thing (which might be because despite the size of the country, there are some significant differences between regions) or those people were just straight up being rude, but i havent met with anything like that before in my life
But it is very weird to me, especially if someone brigs some better bottles (as we did) and someone else is opening them like his own
I suspect you havent seen the [spanish easter celebration] yet
I travelled with Italian in Bulgaria
He could not get over cucumber on a pizza
But Fox news told me you guys are socialists wtf
We're with Germans on this one, you go to a party, you buy booze, which you contribute to the shared pool
Now, if you're a connoisseur like me and don't like to drink cheap shit, it's an unspoken rule to not drink from my fancy Honey Jack Daniels at least not without my approval
But many a times it happened that I went to a party with my two bottles of Jack, 20 euros each, only to have them drank within two ours, me still sober and having to finish myself with some shitty ass French liquor and home made 50% slivovica, which meant I was mixing my spirits, resulting in my untimely puking into a bus station bin at 5AM to the horror of onlooking commuters, kurva piče to bola noc
We share alcohol in gonna get smashed party to
It's just nice to bring a bottle with you to a party, and then you put it on a table with other bottles and then drink everything there - if you wanna get smashed
You can drink your own, but definitely at some point someone will pour you something else from those bottles there
I mean people normally don't bring their 30 years old single malt whisky to those, it's usually just normal alcohol 10 and down per bottle
Beer is cheap in general, so no one cares
Yes, we have the black cat too
I mean with a hat and nice overalls
Bruh that socialism thing was a joke
It's only Bulgarians and Macedonians who are traitors to Slavs in this
Our public TV has a lot of Italian content for some reason
And German
That we drink A LOT
that’s the the stereotype I see the most, told mostly by people from here, which is quite funny since this is also said about Germany, Ireland, The UK, Czechia, Russia,.... like every other country
it’s not original, not cool and not true
Uk is amazing with international food
London is so good when it comes to a top cuisine
But generally things that are usually eaten around UK are a pass for me
I dont like friend fish
I dont like meat pies
i have been all over Uk ate at the best pub even where the menu was 30pounds and was like yeah ok
I dont really east meat so for me it was a pass
I am a big fan of pasty thought
And all the indian food
And jacked potato
Well I lived in Birmingham, thry invented a lot of local mixed cuisine
I did
I've been to a lot of them when I lived there
That's what I ate, but I don't consider vegan food traditional British food
But generally I prefer different type of food than I found in UK
Yeah, but when I think vegetarian, UK cuisine does not exactly jump into my mind
So then yes, I had veggie pasty which I liked and lot of jacket potatoes
I thought the veggies I was used to were harder to get around fresh in UK
So we shopped a lot in Asian shops or Indian places for ingredients because Indian can be pretty vegetarian
I love eating cheese but for that I am pretty much a French whore
But when I think traditional British food, even local places, as I lived in both Cornwall and England
But I age cornish can make some pretty good fish when it's not fried
I am not fan of my native food too or Czech, German or Austrian, I do find them a bit unhealthy so I unfortunately put British into this too
I loved the fusion restaurants in London or Birmingham, however traditional British food (minus pasty) is a pass for me
I eat meat for special occasions, like visiting, or when I went to an Iraq wedding or in Kenya or family tamales in Mexico
As long as it's sunny and not windy or cloudy I can function in short sleeves when it's above 0C, preferably above 5C tho
Above 15C I usually don't care about wind conditions and I just wear short sleeves automatically
Juraj Jánošín - a thief, basically the Slovak Robin Hood
Anton Bernolák - first successful codification of the Slovak language
Ľudovít Štúr - the codifier of the current Slovak language, a politician, with his group they have done numerous of things to help the folk like teaching, lending money to people in need or running anti-alcoholism groups
Revolutionary in the Autro-Hungarian revolution (although not a good one) and cofunder of the first national Slovak assembly during the revolution
Some consider Jozer Tiso as a national hero - the president of the first Slovak state, highly controversial
Hanged for war crimes after WW2
If you ask me, he was a neccesary evil who did the minimum (or something above) to not get replaced by someone even worse
I wouldn't consider him a hero
Alexander Dubček - Czechoslovak president before 1968
Throughout totalitarianism he worked hard to make Czechoslovakia more democratic - reducing censorship, improving free speech, it had been to such a degree that the USSR invaded us in 1968 and established a period of normalisation until 1989
For Slovakia there's also Gabcik and Kubis (in WW2)
Milan Rastislav Stefanik for the first republic of CZSK
Svatopluk (they call him the first Slovak king, even though that's nonsense)
Probably the three leaders of 1848 (Stur,  Hurban and Hodza), who also established the base for current Slovak language
But we also have many from our past with the Austrians and Hungarians (Maria Theresa and Joseph II
for the school reform, Matthias Corvinus for getting rid of the bandits in Slovakia and so on)
Maybe because they're owned by the same company
A lot of people say ‘omg’ but don’t pronounce it the same way the English would, or ‘lol’ is quite popular and people literally say it in conversations, not just in text messages
Obviously people who can speak English a little better use a lot more words but these are the ones that I’ve heard from people who speak no English at all
We used to play "podkopavana", kinda like football, but you didn't have goals, you just had to dribble the ball, while the others tried to trip/kick you and take the ball away and be the chased one
Same in Slovakia, yellow car or smart
If it was yellow smart you got 3 punches
I've never heard about this
Don't be upset, man
Foreigners generally don't know about us
About big towns, we don't really have them big, there Bratislava and then other bigger places as Košice, Žilina
I am usually amazed if they heard anything beyond Bratislava
Košice, more than 200,000 people, direct flights to many Western European capitals and an old town prettier than in Bratislava
My god, that cathedral is amazing in person
Love that city
Brno is overrated, Olomouc is the heart of Moravia
It's beautiful
I can confirm that if someone knows Bratislava, that's pretty good, but if someone unpacks something like Košice, Bardejov, Poprad or other more famous city, that's the performance of the year
When talking about Slovakia, we often get "Yeah yeah Slovakiaa, Czechoslovakia, Hamsik, Skrtel, Zdeno Chara, your president is amazing and you make a lot of cars" and after that, they are completely lost
I'm sorry, but until this day, I thought Nicosia was the capital, and also the only city I knew
Is it not
Ah, my cousin studied there
Piran is an amazing town
Wait what, tell me more about this
To be fair, I would hope our polish neighbours would know a little bit more
Glad kids are keeping the knowledge
Most Poles I've met actually hardly knew Bratislava and nothing else from Slovakia
You're referring to Luník IX
It seems quite popular on the Polish internet
Ive never been to Košice and it makes me sad
But come back to Bratislava
The city always changes, nightlife is great and you can combine it with a trip to Vienna:) Now we actually got a good mayor who is putting the city together at an incredibly fast pace
I like it too
Nice place
Glad you enjoyed it
I met some people in SF that travelled around and even named Strbske Pleso
It was a nice change from Is that where the trump wife is from comments
Trenčín is definitely an above average Slovak city, happy you liked it:) The castle on the rock adds a nice touch to it
Haha very cool
The same happened to Štúrovo/Esztreszgom
But the Hungarians got the sick church on a hill, I think it's the largest Central Europe church
, and we got kebab food and shitty town square :D
Well I would expect our neighbours to be able to name at least 3 cities
Oh wow, you win
Banská Bystrica is actually my favourite town
Well with that I would hope neighbours would know a bit more
But go further Europe and go Northern America and be amazed when it shifts from Czechoslovakia to actual towns
Also got Czechoslovakia in France and Italy
Esztergom, that's a pretty town
Also the historical capital of Hungary one time
He probably means top-of-mind- But I cant phantom why he would think of Prague
Nah we're Slavs so no point in learning
We're "barely European".
Well, even Ljubljana is barely a city, let alone any other Slovene towns lol
It's an even smaller country than Slovakia
But it must feel more "exotic" to Poles
Even you Hungary  Honestly i got used to it
Plus czechs ate still bros
Plus its much better than thinking we speak Russian
Rakúsko-Uhorsko
Uhorsko doesn't mean Hungary in Slovak but the whole area of that part
It included parts (or the entire) of present day Slovakia, Hungary, Transylvania, Croatia, Serbia and Bosnia (maybe Slovenia too
English lacks a word for Uhorsko
Rakúsko-Uhorsko
What’s interesting though is that Slovaks have different names for today’s Hungary - Maďarsko - and for the Kingdom of Hungary - Uhorsko
Maďarsko basically means “the country of Magyars/Hungarians”
Uhorsko means, if I am not mistaken, “country by the mountains”
Rakúsko-Uhorsko
Sa ti hovorí, keď ste boli pod Rakúskom a nie Maďarskom
No, it’s actually named after a town in Austria called Raabs an der Thaya
Over the centuries the area around this town became know as Racouz and from that derives our term “Rakúsy” which eventually became “Rakúsko”
>Tamnica naroda
Similar in Slovak "Žalár národov" (žalár \[žal = žiaľ = big sadness; žalár - room of big sadness = prison\] is basically different name for temnica \[temný = dark; temnica = dark room = prison\], which is Slovak version of tamnica)
Let's say we wouldn't earn a high place, if someone decided to rank countries by their general tolerance
We do drink a lot like many other slavs
You know, it's similar here
However it's a fact that about 50% of them live off of welfare here
Their ghetos are actually dangerous and the most notorious thing is stealing or collecring iron other metals
Seriously, there many cases where they take out all the metal parts from their own houses or apartments to sell them
Some of their clans or families, or however it is called, have the mentality that "working is not the gypsy way to gain money".
This applies to the dishonest ones of course
You can barely recognise the honest ones as "gypsies" on sight
It's often the behaviour, body language (or even bad smell) how you recognise a "gypsy" on the street
It's a problem of mentality caused by the past
>According to his vocabulary there were romani: the ethnicity, and gypsy: the way of life that you just described
That's how I often use it as well
I don't care if the shitty ones get offended over it
I would never call the normal ones that, I don't even aknowledge them being roma since I don't see them by their race, I don't really care about it
Created in 1992
Amended 22 times since then
We require 3/5ths of MPs to vote for amending the constitution so politicians like to put random stuff there so that it’s not easy to overrule it with a simple majority (e.g. in 2014 the coalition joined with opposition catholic and conservative parties for a quid pro quo - judicial reform AND a definition of marriage as a bond between a single man and a single woman got pushed to constitution at the same time
In 2019 populist parties across coalition and opposition pushed pension age (64) there so it can’t be easily changed even though they all admitted it may mean problems for our social systems as soon as 10 years in the future)
veverička in slovak
Slovakia
Veverička .... not translatable
The same in Slovak - veverica
It was only a joke in an old local sitcom as far as I know
Personally, I haven't heard it outside of that show or when someone was referencing it
Mostly regarding some totalitarian regimes
E.g. policies regarding China (one China policy, non-recognition of Taiwan and that except for president nobody mentions human rights at meeting with Chinese officials)
Also that policies towards Russian government tends to be less strict even tho there is no actual shift in their policies which could justify that
Also very lenient reaction on recent Turkish aggression in Syria (I'm not actually sure whether there was any reaction on that at all)
Daaamn, I once want to go to a karaoke where people will be willing to listen to me sing Kraftwerk
Yeah, what is even going out
This post made me miss karaoke so much, and thats something I havent done in years
I now have this fantasy of me doing  Wir fahren fahren fahren auf der *Autobahn*  in a crowded karaoke bar, and i am loving this vision
The other people probably not
I love Spacelab
So hard to find mates that are into Kraftwerk
I would love to use trains to travel around Europe, but most of them are unreliable and you can have huge delay
Slovakia do have terrible trains and railroads
One time I went from Kosice to Bratislava to visit my cousin, it is 400km, took me 8h. Terrible experience
We have a direct train from Bratislava to Zurich that does it in 9 hours for 40€. Flying takes around 4 hours in total (with transportation to/from airports and airport overheads)
That’s probably the longest one I would consider and only because of the ultra cheap price and it being a direct train
Your guys do the best films by yourself anyway
British cinema itself is great and diverse, from romantic stuff to great blackhumour comedies to dramas to even horror films
I was buying plaster in San Francisco and the girl in the shop looked at me as if I was stupid
I couldn't remember American word at all so I had to describe her what it was
Everyone was WTF is a plaster
And yep About time a house in Cornwall, a lawyer living in London, lucky enough to have parents who were friends with a guys who had a house in London
And the girl, had some pretty awesome flat, and no roommates at all
They were loaded
Also ever seen Karluv most this empty in the evening if the weather is good
I wondered how would they ever manage to squeeze Russian wheel into Prague squares
That was Signal festival
I have a friend studying in London right now, he wishes he could slum it this way too
I learned quite late at 9
Other kids were taunting me about not being able to ride a bike
I got pissed, took a bike and rode down the steepest hill around, then kept pedaling around like it was nothing, practically learned instantly
Everybody shut the fuck up, clapped, world peace, you know the drill
Grandma taught me when i was no more than 7 , she would take her old communist bicycle and make me ride the old dirt roads behind our village
Slovak nazi state, from 1939 to 1945
The Samo guy
Some do, but many see 1st CS republic as an ideal state
Some find later commie years (normalizácia) to be a great period to live in
And let's be honest, whole Slovak national revival period is heavilly romanticized by most Slovaks as well
Idk we got neo nazis in the goverment soooo
Probably 'Ružomberok', really dirty city because of factiories, endless traffic jams
I would also nominate Petrzalka, although it's getting better
Yes
It’s not like for our accent (which is recognizable), but Nitra dialect has also a bit different usage of grammar
In standard Slovak and most dialects, the correct way to say the sentence “Come to the store
” is “príď k obchodu”, but in ‘nitránčina’ it is “príď pri obchod” - and that little change between ‘k’ and ‘pri’ IS ALWAYS pointed out
When topic of dialects come up in pub or somewhere like that
“haha you speak funny in Nitra, you use ‘pri’ where you shouldn’t, don’t you
How can you, it’s so strange to use it that way
In Slovak it's the misuse of "y" vs "i" in words and conjugation
Both are pronounced more or less equally, but there are different rules for when to use which one, and then there is a list of words that are an exception to those rules etc
&#x200B;
Use of "y" vs "i" at the end of an adjective, tells whether your're talking about something in singular or plural, where "y" is always a singular adjective
dobrý = good singular
dobrí = good plural
however !!! :)
s dobrými = with good plural
&#x200B;
In some words use of "y" at the end of nouns makes the noun plural
strom = single tree
stromy = multiple trees
&#x200B;
However, in some other words you CAN'T use "y" to make the noun plurar, but must use "i"
chlap = single man
chlapi = multiple men
&#x200B;
The rules are very random and you just have to memorize them
Napadlo ma vs
napadlo mi
Napadlo ma - means you were attacked by something
Napadlo mi - means came to my mind
Most of the people use only napadlo ma and it's annoying when you know the difference
My and mi - first one means we and the second one (to) me
EDIT: might be helpful to say that both are pronounced the same
Having said that, anyone using Y at the end of a verb, which is simply never correct
Prišly sme domov a najedly sme sa
I get that one sometimes forgets the more random rules in regards to y/i usage, they are arbitrary and frankly, y should not even exist within Slovak alphabet
But the verb thing shows me you are a complete idiot
I forgot about the verbs, but yeah "y" on verbs is a great filter that tells you you are talking with an idiot
>... using Y at the end of a verb, which is simply never correct
While mostly true, - *umy sa
* exists
Karu selli
Ha, fair
Reminds me of my favorite Eastern Slovak verb in imperative that does not exist in Slovak - rošni
Well I think in most Universities here this isn't a thing, besides from medical ones and few others maybe
Although we had something kinda similar here(at University) called Prax, for 2-3 weeks(4 hours per work day)
You had to find it yourself, it was free ofc and you barely learned anything
I mean if you wanted to get paid during University, your best bet here(and usually the only thing), where I studied was working as cashier at Tesco or McDonald's lol
The country you are working at, is responsible for social benefits and so on
and most EU countries have this well regulated under variety of emploee protection programs
Im probably gonna blow your mind with this, but if you worked enough years in two countries you will get pensions from two countries when you retire
Oh yes, one more entry in Slovak: Snatch by Guy Ritchie has been translated as "Podfu(c)k". "Podfuk" in Slovak means a scam and does not derive from the f-word at all
It's even a tier-2 pun, because a more expressive way to put a scam or subversion in Slovak is "Podjeb" which derives from "jebať", which in fact is the f-word
It would render to German as "unterficken". I don't know how clearly I put it, but if one thinks in some blend of Slovak and English, it just fits perfectly
Shanghai Noon with Jackie Chan was translated as "Once upon a Time in the East". It was impossible to pun on High Noon in Slovak, but I think they did their best
"Die Hard" is translated as "Smrtonosná pasca" which means "deadly trap".
"Now you see me" is translated as "Podfukári" which means "scammers".
Maybe you should have sticked with Merkwürdigliebe, it got so confusing with Marvel these days
I think those words are synonyms in this case
Robbed in a face-to-face confrontation by 2 gypsies
No, not really
I've been able to avoid trouble so far
My iphone was stolen once
I had someone break into my (forgotten) Origin account and buy a shitton of FIFA microtransactions, I managed to get them all refunded
There is [this] popular punk band who once made a pretty funny Rammstein parody, by playing their music style and throwing in random words in Slovak
Or, actually, there are [two] These guys just took the chords of Amerika and sing along names of all places in Slovakia, which they find to be shitholes
Since the release, nobody takes foremost the titular town of Prievidza seriously
The vast majority of the music I listen to is black metal and post-metal
I also unironically like Ellinoora
I fucking love Horkýže Slíže so much
Mocking the shit out of the German language is literally timeless humor
Oh Lord, that's some trashy pop
I was fortunate to turn it off soon enough
Fairly ubiquitous, even in rural areas
Only old dilapidated buildings don't have these
I just recently started watching his videos
I'm not even into trucks or driving for that matter but his videos are extremely relaxing and satisfying to watch
PPPiter is actually pretty good
PPPeter
PPPeter i just really like his style of comedy he talks about the countries he visited and everyday things like glasses Gyms Schools etc
"pppEter" - for international audience (as he has different accounts for czechoslovakia and rest of the world)
And he is probably the only one better known yet not annoying slovak youtuber
There is actually a polish youtuber living in north korea if i am not misstaken, but i dont remember the name
It depends
With people we see reguraly we usually greet each other without physical contact
However, if you were waiting someone arriving (like at an airport) or saying farewel for a longer time, a handshake is more common
I am a cat person in a dog country
Don't get me wrong I love dogs
They ate just a bit more needy than cats
I like how cant can take care of themselves
Plus their personality is like mine
Rusyn language
[Goral] and [Rusyn] are the first ones which come to my mind
There is also Hungarian and Roma language, but those should be relatively known ones
[Goral] and [Rusyn] are the first ones which come to my mind
There is also Hungarian and Roma language, but those should be relatively known ones
[Goral] and [Rusyn] are the first ones which come to my mind
There is also Hungarian and Roma language, but those should be relatively known ones
[Goral] [Rusyn] and [Romani] are the first ones which come to my mind
Others are minority languages of nationalities who have their own country so that shouldn't count as "lesser known".
Absolutely not
In my village we can use the bus and the train to go to the closest town, which is also connected directly to the capital by bus and train
Nope
Sometimes I get angry when I cant take both skis and snowboard when I go skiing, because I take a bus to the resort or a train, but thats it
I lived in a capital city and definitely never wanted to have a car there
Its sometimes needed in rural areas as usual, but I get by without a problem
OK this may have led to me being scared of driving, because never really gotten into it, because I moved to the capital city as soon as I got my licence
What's the state public transport in the US
I always see in movies and other things that you have a strong car culture and it's really a neccesity
In bigger cities you have public transport cards that you pay for monthly, you just need to have it with you in the case of control
If not, you can buy tickets from machines (pay in cash or debit card), or from the driver (that is not recommended, only for a last minute purchase)
Between the cities and in villages you usually pay in cash or use a top up card specific to the bus company of your choice
Slovak Lines will have a different card from Arriva and so on
When it comes to trains, depending on the location, you can use the same card as on the buses (city specific card of Bratislava, for example), but you need to have it activated for the zones you pass through I think
Otherwise you pay in cash for a one-time, weekly or monthly ticket
Sometimes you can even pay online, using an app or a site, but these sites are usually a bit clunky in my opinion (except for RegioJet, which works, but it's just badly designed)
Syr
Or rather syyyyyr
Which is literally just cheese
We produce most cars per capita in the world, and around 26% of our whole industry is dedicated to production of cars and car parts
Well and thats tragic, in my point of view
Volkswagen, KIA, Peugeot Citroen and Jaguar Land Rover
There is, however, only one car company native to Slovakia: K-1 Engineering, which produces hand-made luxury sport cars
Ice Hokey for us, even though violence is way less common than for football
Mainly when we play against each other ;)
Goddamn 20th century !
It’s shame that it always ends with WW2 and 50s and the rest is just quickly said
80s and 90s were also important in terms of how our country looks today
But whatever, I think people don’t care much about the history
And I find it sad
Edit: grammar
Lol, “only” 5k...
Not quite the experience, but I was listening to a radio one evening with my father in his car on our way home when I was 16 and the radio station started playing the song 'Rape Me' by Nirvana
Let's say that I was quite surprised to see my father nonchalantly singing the lyrics, even though he didn't know their meaning and translation, because he doesn't speak English at all
Mine has changed very much, to the point that I can no longer listen to some new pop songs, which is a bummer because then I am no longer able to dance on them on the parties
Breivik has joined the chat
Dunno, I used to go each month for half a year so I get my teeth fixed up, now I go when they start to hurt, I get them done and maybe some cleaning or whatever
Its not really a matter here, there are plenty of them to choose from, you can book any day any time you want and they are not very expensive either
Everything is very convenient in terms of dental care here
In Slovakia, if you don't go for a check-up, the next year your healthcare insurance for dental will be void
meaning you will have to pay the full price for implants and such
Still, quite a lot of people don't go, there are official statistics somewhere
Also, there is a difference between dental hygiene and dentist
In the past the dental hygiene was less common, nowadays it's becoming more recognised
People usually go once a year
The crappy thing is, it's considered a premium healthcare, so not every insurance covers it and some employers even don't accept the pardon for work absence, because it's not a doctor
it's a legal definition thing
Well yes, insurance does not cover much from private dentists, so most of the people just meh´s it
I didn’t go to dentist for my whole college so my first year after that I didn’t have insurance
The difference between filling cost was 20€ without insurance and 16€ with lul
It reaaaaaly depends on what culture they are coming from
With integration - obviously europans have it easier, then westerners, than russians etc
the further from central european christian valued slavic countries, the harder the integrating
But that makes pretty much a lot of sense
To the second question, it really depends on when they come from
Switzerland, norway, canada, australia, new zealand - perfect
japan, south korea, singapore, vietnam (strangely enough)
- not a single problem
Balkan, eastern european countries (non eu members), usa - okay but a bit suspicious
Russia, latin america - worse
turkey, iran, middle asia, india, china
- much worse
most of africa - bad
arabs or pakistani - very bad
Why Korea
I find this interesting
Its the drinking and sheep
Honestly
People know very little about Slovenia in general
But everything they know seems be positive
"You know, we are not that different you and i". I would say if it comes to this judging, you are at top of the list, to the point it's not even being viewed as positive (like this kind of "positive discriminaton" in the case with Swiss for example) but as one of us, so like Czechs, polish
Which is the closest you can get
So almost like brothers
I think the outlook on Slovenia is definitely the most positive from all of the "Balkans", and it's among Czechs, poles, Austrians
Because from we see you are even more like us than Czechs which is a brother nation, in some cases
If you picked a Slovak a put him somewhere in Slovenia, if people were not taking, he wouldn't know he is in a different country
Because let's be honest here for a moment - it's not a different country, it's just a trick we play on Hungary and Austria
Maybe you should check
Interesting
Because over here over the border, the attitude is very different
People from East Asia would be welcomed (except for Chinese)
Because they are seen as polite, hard working and causing no troubles
Maybe because the biggest non European minority in those countries (Slovakia, Czechia, Poland) is Vietnamese
And they cause no trouble even though they are not fully integrated into society
Even Chinese could be okay, but people would be way more suspicious
Its interesting actually
From my experience in uk or france, I thought that Muslim women are actually treated nicer
Mostly because lot of people kinda put them into the victim category
Which is a bit patronising
So they were treated much better than men, who are often viewed a bit skeptically
Because they get associated with bad issues in the religion
But I do agree that you generally draw attention outdoors
Especially as blond tall person
With me and my blond coworker, there was always attention on us in Kenya/Tanzania
People were curious, wanted to talk
But unfortunately it felt like people automatically assumed we are super rich or something and often treated us as a cashcow
Like bartenders giving us higher tabs, people making us pay for their meals and stuff
What the hell is going on with vienna
[This one] is my favourite one - it means - be aware, there are slaves on the road
also "hlapec"(boy) and "jed"(poison) are the good ones
>Our reverse is "fukati" - though that might be with Czech, I'm not sure
But I hear it means sth like to blow air up there and here it's, well, straight from English
I know about this one, its similar here with "šukať". Which means "looking for" in polish, yet "to fuck" in slovak/czech
You can imagine my surprise as a kid watching polish tv, some movie for children with hulk hogan, when out of nowhere he claimed: "idzem pošukať dzieci" or something like that (i dont know how it is written in polish), which in slovak means: "i am going to fuck the children"
I have no idea
What about Ukrainian
They have few similar words
During cold months 3(sometimes 4) times per week, during summer pretty much every day
you need a very strong anti-dandruff shampoo for oily hair
i mean very strong as including some medicine - from the pharmacy
or at least one that includes zinc, salycile acid, nettle extract
You, Spaniards, actually use scissors in the kitchen for many things, not just to cut a pizza
My boyfriend is from Málaga and I’ve seen things like cutting the lettuce or other vegetables with scissors
It blew my mind, even though it completely makes sense, I mean, if it works it works
but before it’d never cross my mind to do that
Personally, in my family, for pizza we either use a pizza cutter or a fork and a sharp knife
That is literally the first time I hear about this
My personal favourite is Marcus Aurelius, the last of the five good emperors, and a stoic - I really liked his book (diary) - Meditations, part of which he has apparently written in the area of modern day Slovakia
What
Roman empire was ever under the rule of somebody else than Caesar
... Asterix lied to me
... also I dunno anybody else tbhh except maybe that Sula guy
Is roman empire that important part of history
Indeed, it was a shame, and yea, there were many emperors that had interesting lives
overall I find the whole Roman era very fascinating
Bratislava (440k), Košice (240k), Prešov (88k)
Bratislava- Well, capital city of Slovakia
I think its Luxembourg of central europe, because there are small population but there is a thousands more people who go for work there
Bratislava has very modern downtown
Košice- Its a metropole of east Slovakia
There is a tram system and nice old town, but then its here just plenty of communist barracks
Prešov- Oh, there are jokes of this ''city''. Many people call this city village
I was there and there is nothing to do
I walked old town in 30 minutes and there was nothing opened only one caffé. Then I wanted souvenir so I must go to the shopping center for one souvenir
There is also plenty of communist barracks, but they have very good public transport
Hey what do you say about Malaga, Santiago de Compostela and Bilbao
Are you from Brno by any chance
Freedom of choice and right to refuse doesn't say anything about freedom from consequences
People who are not vaccinated (with exception for people who with e.g. immunity diseases who cannot be vaccinated) should be quarantined or forbidden from accessing public places or forced to wear closed protective clothing with internal circulation of air
Yes, but it's very arbitrary and depends upon the person who translates the name
I've seen Margaret being translated as Margita (a typical name among elderly women), George to Juraj, Nicolas to Mikuláš, etc
Slovakia heard people were saying we were a third world country
Its actually nice to live here
Bratislava is definitely nothing like it was portrayed in the Eurotrip movie
Are you portrayed horrible
I always wanted to travel to baltics, you guys look so awesome
Plus only met the most amazing people from Latvia
And  Estonia
And my best friend studied IN Lithuania and she loved it
said the Eastern German
No, Felvidek (Upper Country)
Get your facts straight
The train station is such a shame, it should be the first priority in Bratislava to fix, yet nothing is happening
At least they did some minor renovations for hockey championships
Yeah, we hate that place too
There was a huge amount of real estate development since 2011 and still ongoing
Lots of high rises too in the new extended city centre near Eurovea, most of it will be completed in 1-2 years, but I expect it to continue for next 4-5 years
As for the vibe, its seasonal, the best vibe is during the summer days, and then additionally for a few weeks during Christmas
As the city does not offer many touristic attractions, it's really about the atmosphere, and that is best experienced with friends or with locals that know where and when to go
The city is also becoming quite international, last official stats talked about 8% foreigners living in the city, which is particularly experienced in the old town, where you hear foreign languages all the time
Plenty of foreign students as well
In the end, it's really down to what you're looking for from travelling
Some people go for sights, others for the vibe and local life experience
Being a local, I would definitely recommend you give it another shot again
Like i said in a different comment, Bratislaba is not for sight tourism as much as for experiencing the vibe, bars and laid back atmoshere
Glad you had a nice visit tough
As Bratiskava resident, where
Collect your internet points
Head over to r/slovakia before you come and ask for suggestions
We'll help out
What does it mean
Like someone brown skinned, or specifically from kaukaz
Try [Algor - Čas odplaty] for Slovakia
Not really metal, but the Finnish neofolk band Nest does use kantele as one of the main instruments
I recommend trying out the album Woodsmoke
The mentioned Amorphis does too I think, they even have an EP My Kantele, although kantele is not listed in the instruments played, but acoustic guitar
The acoustic version of My Kantele is phenomenal though
Let aside all I know, I wonder if I am the only one who's always felt Benelux would be a great name for a brand of lightbulbs
"Thank" is a verb and all verbs in Slovak (and I believe it's common for all Slavic languages) have different form based on who (1st, 2nd or 3rd person and sg
or pl
) is thanking
So for Slovak it is:
* I - ďakujem
* You (sg
),  - ďakuješ
* He/She/It - ďakuje
* We - ďakujeme
* You (pl
) - ďakujete
* They - ďakujú
How do you pronounce it
Not common but most of people dont care bout other peoples hairstyles
Usuaully what I hear :
Regular dark hair - Oh so you are into metal
Rasta braids - he does drugs
My opinion about long hair - Must be annoying to wash them
Of course Finland would say this
I used to go be around metal head guys in high school
And this was their biggest problem as they got older and started loosing hair
They were so heartbroken
But don't worry I am sure you still look good
Modlivka zelená - Modlit means to pray and zelená means green
Modlivka in Slovak
"Something (feminine) that prays"
But doesn't it make more sense the way we do it
I mean:
"What do you call praying mantis
"Oh, you know, just all those big green bugs doing that funny thing with their front legs and nothing else
In Soviet Russia, male mantis eats the female, apparently
And Mantis religious is Modlivka Zelená so green something that prays
I did think about the subject seriously, though, and I am puzzled if I am used to saying "how" only because it's a calque from my own language (where the sentence would cringe with the equivalent of "what"), or because I am constantly trying to mimic other people when speaking a foreign language and I am curious, *how* do they English properly, or because I have simply heard other people say "how" instead of what
Probably the last option holds
My pick would be Bocelli's Con Te Partiro
First it had my curiousity, and from the first line until the end it had my full attention
That we are East Europe
That we are Czechoslovakia
That we are Slovenia
Le Northern Hungary has arrived
Why wasn't it fair
Is it a guy you are married to by any chance
Yes I get that
I also understand that a lot of people is still used to pre-89 political classification of countries to Western and Eastern bloc
Well personally I'm not bothered by it as much
I simply inform them that we are somewhere in geographical center of the Europe
Anyway, Czechs got it even worse because many people consider Austria as Western Europe and Czechia as East Europe while Vienna is located way more east than Prague :D
We hanged Jozef Tiso and generally punished the rest
Government officials as president Jozef Tiso, ministers, leading party members, etc
were sentenced to death or to prison
However they weren’t the only ones participating and maintaining the regime
There were lot of people in party or in military organizations
One of typical stories from that era: report local Jews, aryanizate their property, after war change your coat to communist party and report anyone who would have enough courage to say anything against you
Of course it wasn’t only like this - but I wanted to give different view and that there wasn’t always true justice for those greedy people
Really
How were they punished
And "we" hanged Tiso
I don't really know, that's what I assume
Tiso was used by both Communists and democratic parties in 45 - 48 period, where some wanted his execution while others not so much
The execution alone was more of an political tool rather they justice served
Others weren't even punished that hard, [Šano Mach] for example got only 30 years of prison and was released after general pardon of 1968
More than I can possibly count
Just a few
I can see castle(well ruins) when I look out of the window, so I guess they weren't that super interesting
But than again I don't travel that much
Me and my brother were huge fans of medieval warfare and medieval time in general as kids, so our mom took us to a lot of castles and castle ruins pretty often
I've lost the count so far, but I guess it could be around 50 or 70, since we've visited some of them more than one time
You can't possibly go anywhere without passing at least one castle, castle ruin or chateau along the way here
So I lost count a long time ago :D
me too lol
Oh yes, that's probably the prettiest, most touristy, theme-park-like one that we have
Which reminds me, I still have to see Pony Park Slagharen
I am curious about it since the "America First, Netherlands Second" video
I believe it's inconclusive
I've heard that Wales has more, but noone knows what was considered as a castle when counting them there
If you count castle ruins too, it's very very likely
All credits go to Hungarian nobility, of course
Wales got more per mile, Belgium more per Kilometer, but Slovakia has most per capita
We were taught at school that most aristocracy in present-day Slovakia was ethnically Hungarian, or at least spoke Hungarian
It only makes me wonder, to what extend our separatism was a matter of language and to what extend it was a product of class struggle, actually
This is false
Most of the nobility in Slovakia was of a Slavic/Slovak origin
It was a huge problem in the early stages of monarchy since most of them didn't speak hungarian so communication with Hungarian nobility and the king was complicated
However, nationality didn't really play role till like 18th/19th century
Till then we were all Hungarians or more specifically inhabitants of Hungarian kingdom and nobody really cared what language you use
Just after then people started realize that we might be of a different ethnicity since we speak a very different language
Anyway, in late years of monarchy Slovak-speaking nobility was naturally shrinking
Also it didn't help when magyarization laws were implemented in 19th century which shrinked it even further, but it also empowered independance movements
"Najčistejšou" - "with the most pure" - comes to my mind, without too much thinking
It is very likely there is a word even shorter than that, but please, give me some credit, surely you all know how consonant-heavy west slavic languages are
Oh hi Mark
"Miešanou" - "with the mixed" - popped to my mind only a minute later
You see, we are not monsters, we can employ vowels if we want
"Eufória" can also be considered, but it is foreign
It's same sound
But by i/y you know, if you are talking in singular or plural
Pekní/pekný
Lol here it's not only normal, but mostly expected, especially on night lines
The situation you described is normal and I have seen it (and participated in singing) many times, especially when there is some festival or event taking place along the bus line
It's also common to see peple drinking while riding a bus, as I also did many times before with friends
Three of them come to mind: Slovak uprising against Hungary in 1840s (together with establishment of official Slovak language by Ľudovít Štúr and subsequent rise of Slovak national identity), the Treaty of Trianon when we finally broke from Hungarian chains and finally, official establishment of Slovak republic in 1993
I am officialy sorry for Babiš, guys
Grenadiermarsch, colloquially known as "granatír". Although I wouldn't say it's a popular food, because I am certainly not the only one who hates it with passion, but it's very frequently served in school cafeterias, hospitals and other public facilities
If I ever ended up on death row, I'd request it as my last meal, without pickles and along with Steiger 10° beer, to look forward to the execution
Anything with liver in it
Or meat with a lot of fat(mainly pork)
Also I won't eat anything else from chicken besides breasts
From veggies definitely borecole
We call it kel here and I especially dislike small variant called ružičkový kel
Yes, Aspic is the most disgusting thing I have ever tasted
Worse is that my family loves it and it stinks so fucking much when someone makes it
Tartar sauce is the best lol
yes
I didn’t like it in school canteen but made at home it can be quite tasty
Yes yes, it's a very military-grade dish
Anyway, if you ever pay a visit to Slovakia, I suggest to try bottled Steiger 10°, for similar reason tourists in Sweden try surströmming
S touto diskusiou stále v živej pamäti som sa práve odhodlal, po pätnástich rokoch granatír znova vyskúšať a trvám na tom, že aj [domáci] je presne tak hnusný, ako si ho pamätám zo školskej jedálne
Ajaj, *kdepak udělali soudruzi z NDR asi chybu
nemôžem za to, že očividne chabé prevedenie zničilo jedlo, ktoré môže byť tak chutné!
viac sa posnažiť treba ;) a poriadne domáce zaváraniny k tomu
Abstinence-shaming; lot of people make fun and shame people that don't drink
If you are abstinent and don't drink during some social event, lot of people make fun of you, that you are "weak" or "weird".
Just to reiterate how awesome and influential Skansen museum is, the Slovak word for any open-air museum is "Skanzen".
Not as common as McDonalds
In Bratislava, there are only 3 KFC restaurants (5 in the whole country), and only one of them has drive-through
Four restaurants in our country, two of them in the capital
Foreign restaurants of this type are rare at SK, since Mc is everywhere
KFC/Burger king/Panda express/Subway etc - rare spawns
We have one too, organized by a state company but i dont know anyone who cares about it (or even knows about it)
We have a scratchcard “Christmas Lottery” here in Slovakia
3M tickets printed, 7€ per ticket
432k tickets win 7€, 485k tickets win more, highest price is 150000€. It’s almost 1:6 chance to win something but the jackpot is 1 in a million and nothing extra
Hmm what is your price
I had my hopes for Istanbul, thought it would be more secular, given its history
Lol, anyway, very interesting, thanks for the info
Best of luck to you guys there
Stray dogs - only in Roma slums, it's quite problematic
Stray cats - it's not easy to tell if a cat is stray or not in the countryside
Ive never seen a stray dog
Not really
There was just a short lesson explaining the dialects and the differences between them
Sadly, our language is standardized to death in our educational system and any dialectal influences are frowned upon
I wouldn't speak in a dialect in public simply because it's been considered wrong and uneducated in the past century
In many European countries we hear these big words about preserving our cultural heritage but it apparently doesn't apply to everything
For how small we are, you would believe how many dialects we have, some are just different pronunciations but some are entirely different words and sentence sequences, like holy shit I myself know like 15 ways of saying a "potato" in slovak
No we only have one literary Slovak language at schools that said we have foreign schools with foreign languages as main language of course
I'll be damned if I speak with anything other than the Trnavan dialect
Well, regional dialects in Slovakia usually differ much more from standard Slovak than standard Czech from colloquial Czech
Moreover, there's no omnipresent colloquial variant (even though some features like Ľ>L are widespread)

They didn't. The ban is only on single use plastics by 2021 (straws, utensils etc

Austria - Vienna
Mainly because it's an awesome city
Austria has the Euro, both countries have awesome nature
And I would be close to my home - Bratislava, which is just an hour drive away
Austria, cause it's right behind the corner
Switzerland doesn't.
The route I take to visit my parents is 5
80€ for 50 minutes (90km) on a EuroCity train (highest quality train in Slovakia, cause it’s actually a Czech trainset going from Prague to Budapest)

I would probably consider myself an upper middle class but not that much
20yo M, living in the capital Bratislava
Avg income in Slovakia is about 1000 €, avg in capital Bratislava is about 1600 €. The regional differences are there in Slovakia, the west is a pretty wealthy area, even considered to be the 3rd richest region in Europe – which upsets the east greatly
The easterners will tell you that Bratislava is a different country and it is a bit, but it's not like other people have no money or no saving to a higher degree than any other European country,
I make around 1700-1800 €, my expenses are around 1000 €, investing 500 € each month and the rest keeping in basic account for vacations, crazy nights or other non-covid sorcery
Slovakia is the equalest place on earth (no joke actually) as such I never felt it, but people here tend to not go bankrupt often

Andrej Babiš is Slovak *(even though in denial)* and is currently prime minister of the Czech Republic, which means both countries are run by Slovaks now

You thank ... the bus
For getting you to the destination or ... ? I mean it sounds cute but we definitely dont talk to inanimate object ... apart from phones
Sorry to interrupt, but for example here the public transport in cities works the same way, you can get on the bus by whichever door you want and just sit down or stand and get off whenever you want
Obviously, you need to have either a prepaid card or a ticket for X minutes
Every now and then a ticket inspector comes and controls everyone, and if you travel without a ticket, gotta pay a 50€ fine
[This] is a typical bus in Bratislava, as you can see there's a lot of doors to choose from
And they have a few movies now
In slovakia we use the word šukať means fuck in polish it means find

I don't want my language to survive
I don't like it
Better be rid of it
Not worried
I actually do hope, that one time, English will eradicate other languages, including my native one
No, not at all
People can speak English more often, but their English isn't at a high level when speaking
Also, I don't mind that works are more commonly in English instead of the native language
Different languages have different features and can be better used in different situations, like some languages are genderless and using them can intentionally obscure a detail in the work
Also, writing in English means your work has a much larger reach and can become more successful and affect your career choice if you want to be a writer, actor, streamer/youtuber and a multitude of other things that are affected by the language you use
> I dont see any good reason to have months named differently then rest of the world
Yeah, that one's strange
I didn't learn all Czech names for months until I was maybe 23
It's just needlessly complicated
Zbojníci - in later medieval and early modern era, zbojníci were bandits that robbed travellers and merchants on roads going through remote areas of today's Slovakia, while using deep forest and challenging terrain to evade the law
I was 28 y.o. when I was first explained, by an American, where does the word "beťár", meaning a trickster, come from
> Also connected to Slovaks as well
In Slovak, we call them Zbojníci, which is in Slovak language basically word for bandits
There is also word "beťár" which is a word to describe bad and wrong-behaving child
Wait, I am sure there is a Czech song about them
Now that you say this, our word for a bridge is "most" and since I've learned English, I feel it would be very correct to refer to tunnels as "lísts".

Thats interesting
Slovakia - Central Europe
People from Western Europe say that we are eastern Europe, because Europe was split for 40 years by Iron curtain
It ended 30 years ago and since then countries in V4 were developing in different direction that Russia, Ukraine or Belarus
Even before socialism, they were influenced much more by Germans than Russians
Therefore is seem logical to me to consider these countries a separate region and not part of eastern Europe
Nah, we're still Eastern Europe
Yup
And guests should too

In cities it's less common than chicken, pork and beef, but it's still that one meat we sometimes eat
Dick breast, interesting
Czech Republic and Slovakia
That’s such utter bull crap
We are extremely close, I have very little common with Poles, Ukrainians, Austrians, or Hungarians, but Czechs are a brother nation
We share a common history (of over 70 years), traditions, culture, food, etc
My dad is Czech, my mom is Slovak, I have both citizenships and to say that we have no similarity is so very nuts
Seriously, we watch the same movie during Christmas, like the same sports, eat the same food, drink the same alcohol, understand each other, listen to similar music
You’re telling me a German will have svíčková for Sunday lunch, bake some koláče to take over to their neighbors for the afternoon visit which they will drink slivovica during, while watching some Hrebejk movie
Dude
I honestly do not know how to reply - your life experience seems so extremely foreign to the one of my friends and family, from both countries
I will not take the time to go point by point, simply because this whole thing is seemingly highly subjective, and it makes no sense to try to persuade you that your own experience is invalid, when it is clearly not
I am extremely confused about how adamant you are about the differences you perceive
Whenever I am in Czech Republic, I feel like I am home
I can't say that about any other country in the world (including the US, where I've lived significantly longer than I have ever spent in Czech Republic)
Ultimately, I am happy we have split, primarily due to the political development in the region
Poland, Hungary, and partially you guys, have lost the independence of media which has lead to highly corrupted governments with authoritarian tendencies (primarily in Poland and Hungary), while Slovakia goes through a rebirth of liberal democracy and civic society started by a heinous murder Jan Kuciak
I will take Zuzana as a president over Zeman any day
And our opposition (with Progressive Slovakia as the leading party) over yours
It is a competition

Biological nature of beings = get the healthiest and the prettiest partner to reproduce with, which works both ways not just the male->female way
That's why people work out, take care of themselves, so they can pick from the best, highten their chances
Yes, it's misogynistic, but it also isn't at the same time
It really depends on how you're willing to perceive it - from the scientific, biological-evolutionary point, or from the point of a person who is outraged by words
Indeed
I don't know what's the point here but I agree with you
We have three major groups of ethnical minorities with their own language: Hungarians, Romani and Rusyn
Most of them speak their own language among themselves and only speak Slovak when talking to Slovak people
[Imrich Karvaš] the governor of the central bank of the short-lived Slovak state during WWII
He secretly collaborated with dissent underground movement, preparing an uprising against the nazi-aligned puppet government led by Jozef Tiso
In 1944, on his authority, about 3B Slovak crowns (present value about $750M) were transferred from the central deposit in Bratislava to the branch of the bank in the town of Banská Bystrica, which was about to become the main base of the insurgents, formally justifying the decision with concerns about the possibility of allied bombing of the capital
When the uprising broke out, the armed insurgents simply seized the money and were able to purchase the loyality of common people living in the region
The street in Bratislava where the seat of the central bank is located now is named after him
I mean, beat that, Salvadors Dalís!
I didn't know that
Very good comment
Capital city has probably the best international options for obvious reasons
Other cities might be a bit more limited, but bigger cities will still offer some international options and sometimes even quite unique or unexpected ones (e.g. opened by some former foreigner who moved here)
For example, there are Korean restaurants in Žilina because there is KIA factory (Korean car producer) and due to that small Korean community lives in the city
Slovakia is not a popular country for migration due to lower living standards compared to e.g. Germany so exotic restaurants are still considered rare and/or unique outside of capital
What is pretty common are Chinese/Asian restaurants
Those rarely offer authentic Chinese food tho
In bigger cities it's common to find also Sushi restaurants and Indian restaurants
Those tend to be more authentic
Kebab fastfoods are pretty common as well
Otherwise it's more or less standard Slovak and Czech cuisine with a lot of European influence and food
Italian restaurants are pretty common as well
Also there is a lot of restaurants without focus on a cuisine of a specific nation or region and instead they offer wider variety of foods
Generally just European foods tho but it's possible to find some exotic ones offered as well
As a citizen of Playoff winner B, I think we have a chance for the 2nd spot
Just asking, who's the last team England lost to recently
Probably the widespread ignorance towards certain issues
Ignorance towards the corruption in our country, EU politics and politics in general, social issues (racism, homophobia, etc
), global issues (global warming and ecological problems in general), health (there's a rather high rate of obese people- we ranked 7th in the EU, as far as I know), ignorance towards the other people (most noticeable on the roads and in the streets),...
A lot of people here have this way of thinking:' As long as it doesn't happen to me or my family, who cares
'. This can be applied to the things I mentioned as well
Simply put, people often don't give a flying fuck about certain things and love to live in their little bubble, but this is a problem not exclusive to only Slovakia
Lol, nope never
Biggest city, relative close to Wien
Its already function as capital of Slovakia
Also there Austrian royal jewelry
Slovak expressions are pretty boring
Basically just:
Mám to v piči/I have it in my cunt
Mám to u riti/I have it by my ass
Mám to v piči - lit
I have it in vagina
Said by both genders
Mám na háku  - lit
I have it on hook
Je mi to 1/5 - lit
It's one/five for me
Mám to u riti - lit
I have it by my side(buttocks)
In Slovak we have 'Je mi to ukradnuté' which would translate to 'It is stolen to me', but it actually meant 'I really don't care' in a not very friendly fashion
Well, more polite one is "Je mi to jedno". Literally translated "It's the one to me", but more semantically translated "It's all the same to me".
Yeah but everyone uses it only with their parents

Czech president Milos Zeman is also famous to smoke in non-smoking environments
There's a scene after his first presidential victory where inside Czech Public TV (non-smoking building) asks the general director directly where is the "ashtray", so he has to find some and the president just lights up a cigarette
Other time the Czech state had to pay for cleaning a non-smoking hotel room etc
He famously said, if you start smoking after your 20's it will be not damaging to your health

Can we have a referendum like that about Subcarpathian Rus, as it was given to USSR without their consent, despite the popular support and campaign for it to stay within Czechoslovakia
Wdym ? why would europe hate him
crimea had referendum and they wanted to join russia, so they did, everything else is just water under the bridge now
that definitely wouldn't spill over to Ukraine, nope
So, is there any context to this photo or evidence that he was actually performing the nazi salute ? Because throwing someone under the bus just because of a still image doesn't seem fair, Like that photo of prince William where it looks like he's giving someone the middle finger
I mean this guy might be a nazi for all I know but the fact is that we don't know and we shouldn't just assume this from one picture
what I see in his face is the eternal disappointment in the unfairness of the life in that he is ugly and never has gotten much pussy
So he is sticking out in his own retarded way
How clueless can you get
that never ceases to amaze me
Lobotomized dickhead with speech impairment Kotleba is another example of an imbecile misinterpreting history
But what I really worry about is how the fuck he got into the power
The russian money didn't do it on it's own, he had to have enough votes
The whole former soviet block is turning nazi
Oh the irony
To be honest, seeing photos of people doing the nazi salute is a bit iffy, it can just be a coincidence or the photo was taken just at the right time when his hand was in that position
But also he can just be a nazi, point is that photos are not really good evidence for this kind of thing without context
Goddamn patriots, they ruined patriotism
Jokes aside, I completely understand what you're saying
I love the idea of being proud of your country, since Europe is so beautifully diverse and we should be happy about what each of our countries has to offer; however, it's apparently too easy to slide into the toxic nationalism coupled with xenophobic views
I mean, yeah, he's probably a nazi, Im just saying that you can't know that for sure from a photo out of context
I don't see what's wrong with having evidence before passing judgement ?
No, I don't think I will
As a German you should know that that is not a proper nazi salute, also I never said that he is not a nazi, most likely he is, I just said that a still image like this is not evidence
Roght, so [Hilary Clinton] is also a Nazi ? Or [Bernie Sanders] ? Or [Hilary] again, or [this girl] ?
If you haven't noticed I also said that this guy is most likely and nazi, my personal opinion is that people like that should be sent in front of a firing squad
Think again
You already have enough Serbs and Ukrainians and they aren't exactly nice neighbours
Boris is really dragging down the dignity of that scene

How
Those are politicians sentenced for crimes of sedition and/or embezzlement
Their guilt in these crimes was proven beyond any reasonable doubt
In fact, we could see them committing most of these crimes on TV
Now, maybe you don't agree that these acts should be considered criminal, and that's OK (although I'm not aware of any country in the world that doesn't criminalise sedition)
Campaign to change the law
But to equate that with people being put behind bars for informing people on what those who hold power do with it is a giant display of ignorance, and frankly, laughable
Your logic here seems to be "I don't like it, therefore it's the same".
Can't say I support that kind of lack of nuance
Anything can be political under the right circumstances, even having an abortion
How does it relate to the map though
interestingly
loud music seem to always feature rap or something "cool"

Drove around Poland for a holiday, can confirm
Poland is the only place I've seen wakie-talkies used in order to know where the police are and therefore be confident of not getting a ticket for

WHat does this even mean

This looks extremely like Bratislava, with a few minor differences
WTF, why do all these people do is want to ban something then less and less people do
We have few morons like this is parliament too and they put the same law every 6 months

I posted meme here and it got removed fml
Ah yes, my beautiful nation
yeah except they've tested 1375 people
The karma gods work in mysterious ways
They  said it was low effort :(
It was another meme
but it prolly was low effort lol
i know it's a joke, but the joke is that the picture overexaggerates the fact that only so few cases are confirmed because they tested only a small sample
but do you honestly think 1375 people is a small sample
63 infected, that means that only around 4% of people tested were positive
come on now
and this information is on r/europe because
Honestly, it's the same as always
Whichever side won, it will still lead to them acting like smug children, as if they obliterated the other side in a landslide victory, even though that isn't the case
Biden won by an incredibly thin margin and that just goes to show how many fans Trump and the Republicans have in the US
No matter whose ass is in the chair, their country is split down the middle by two sides that seem to absolutely hate each other and consider the other side as a bunch of morons
Right now, it seems they would rather watch their entire country burn than to cooperate on anything because the tribalism is just so strong
Biden or trump, what is the difference
Seriously
I just wished he has chosen someone else for vice president
He will be nicer to china - which is probably not good, nicer to environmnet which is probably good (however considering the covid economy aftermath, i dont know about that) and i hope it will calm down american people a bit, and the division will become narrower
Other than that - two old dudes, quite similar honestly, and biden will be easier to push around, i am afraid
What i am interested in however is, what are going to do all the people who built up their careers on hating trump
Are they going to change their careers or what
What about those celebrities mocking trump in their shows
Are they going to switch to full on propaganda and celebrate the glorious leader or are they going to mock biden now, or are they going to just disappear
So what
The media don´t swear in presidents the courts do
We call it "bag of potatoes" over here
We had few "bag of potatoes" presidents over here
I mean, if they retain control of the Senate and Mitch does nothing for the next two years, that sentiment kinda stands
Is there any argument
Why is this straight up stupid
I think this partisanship is straight up stupid
From outside it literally looks like some tribal wars in africa
They are not that different from outside
Typical partisanship
That's so weird
If you think of biden as some kind of Messiah, you are going to be disappointed
He is politician for quite some time
They are similar
Two way too old men with history of lying and abusing people around them, history of corruption etc
One is more lunatic the other one more baked into the system
It literally looks silly from outside
Maybe I am missing something, but to me it looks similar
And your agreement is the argument of "because I love him
People started wearing it like that here too after it got hot
Omg I can not believe Americans are so stupid when it comes to Geography
> Like why is the map angled this way
3 D
Didn't he do this more times
u/savevideo
Even Hitler was
This is kinda sad
Ah yes, the flat-lands
I ask the same thing whenever people post Turkey here, at least in Norilsk majority of citizens are European, Turks have nothing to do with Europe except for tiny stolen land
> ~~Identity~~ politics is a cancer upon society
FTFY
LOL, out of all countries, Poland and Hungary are the ones to think USA is doing fine the most
What a coincidence
Interesting how conservative countries think it works well just because it's the only it's the only way for conservatives in US to win the election
Hungary and Poland think US is just ... makes you wonder how fucked up their government must be
Poland and Hungary
That says a lot
Checks and balances work well, the 2 party system is the problem
Eastern Europe looks favourably at USA for two reasons
First is, that our governments are extremely corrupt, so the US system doesn't look as bad relatively to ours like it is to the western Europe
The second is, that Eastern Europeans see the USA as a country that managed to economically snap the Soviet Unions neck
If you ask here anyone who is their favourite US president, the vast majority will tell you it is Ronald Reagan
&#x200B;
It has nothing to do with Poland and Hungary, or their current governments
You will get similar answers everywhere east of the Berlin wall
> Biden has a president and Trump as a vice, which is how it originally was
what are you talking about please
Thats a bridge
That does not look safe
Yes, they are
Not like neonazis in Bratislava or stupid people in Prague week ago
Fucking eliminated oh my god
I also don't have it for some reason, and my younger sister does
No idea why
Love the tag
Is this what you call swine fever
Female boar with piglets
If you corner it, it will fuck you up
Slovakia has one of these too
There was a public competition in 2008 what will be the common design for a coin commemorating 10 years of EMU
If I remember correctly, it was leaked that this design was made by a Greek which caused rather massive mobilisation of Greeks to vote for this rather underwhelming design
If it weren't for the leak, this design wouldn't probably win
I've red UWU at the bottom
I used to collect these few years back
I will always think about my grandma which used to show me these whenever she found some
Didnt every country had this stickman euro coin
Im fairly sure I have a few from Slovakia and Austria
I've got one of those
That makes sense
The more you know
Sure, I used to collect them
I don't anymore, as there is so many of them that it's unbearable
This would make a badass rocket league arena
Remember to participate in the EU elections this weekend and try to find candidates that support your requests
It's the best opportunity to push things forward that we'll have in the next 5 years
it does
there is a straight line through all the city
In terms of practical action, Slovakia is finishing up another block of nuclear reactors right now; after it goes into operation, our electrical grid should be over 80% covered by carbon-clean energy
In about 4 years, we also plan to shut down the largest coal-fired power plant in the country
Thanks to energy saving lamps and better insulated "passive" housing projects, the electricity consumption per capita is going down as well, so hopefully we are on a right track
i sincerely hope this isn't supposed to be a reference to her song

I think it's really ironic to say this here considering the frequent censoring in many subreddits
I work for a company which deals with flights
Lets say that my fantasies now consist of burning drones alive
In my country they are proposing, or already made law that to operate drone you need security clearance
And fines is like 30k €, Which is fucking ridiculous as it would made all drones no usable, for media, videos clips anything,
I'm in this picture and I don't like it
Slovak parliament:
**Coalition:**
32% - corrupt social democracy
10% - highly corrupt nationalist semi-christian social democrats
9% - hungarians corrupted by the two fuckers above
**Opposition**
5% - Sensible right-wing libertarians
8% misc anti-centralization, usually center-right, politicians
6% center right traditionalist anti-corruption party, though a bit shady
&#x200B;
5% - Corrupt and unsophisticated far-right overt 1488ers, nobody wants anything to have with them
15% - uncategorized, most of them left some of the coalition and opposition parties since 2016
In ideal world
Mostly the coalition just agrees to do whatever the most powerful wants
I remember having close to 30 parties in one election couple years back in our small Slovakia
Yes, our clown(in a middle of a cabinet crisis) was there too
Did he move around like R2-D2
Rest in peace
The title literally brought tears to my eyes omg
Ah shit, here we go again
Remember to vote next year and get the cunts who voted yes out of there
Congrats
Why should a better team lose
Fuck you
No you
Ohh the Soviet Union offered to deliver a million men into Poland and people weren't interested
Imagine that, considering how well their intervention to help save Poland (but actually to murder its intelligentsia and carve it up) went a year later
Had the Soviets wanted safety, they would've allowed for the Polish army to be reinforced from the south east as the allies planned to
But instead they wanted to control Polish territory and manpower, so they decided to invade Poland under a false pretense of offering help and murder the elite
I struggle to see the basis for your assumption that the offer was made in good faith, considering how many times Stalin betrayed his word (especially to the Poles)
> have you forgotten that they took part in carving up your country after Munich
I have not
I'm just not letting that cloud my judgment enough to expect the Polish to give up their sovereignty on something as completely worthless as Stalin's word
Besides, what they took is nothing compared to the lasting damage USSR did after turning my country into a de facto colony
If it isn't my favorite MH17 denier, /u/Glideer, finding solace in alternative history where Stalin got to occupy Poland a year sooner and everything was fine and dandy
The Polish practically gave Stalin no choice but to enslave their nation by refusing to be enslaved
Sure
Wait wait wait, are you not denying that MH17 was shot down with a BUK belonging to Russian armed forces anymore
Have you stopped lying about that
OK, I see your hot take on alternative history based on pure conjecture (well, and an unwavering servility to the interests of the Russian state) and raise
USSR roles over Poland and the whole world sees it's amazing and acknowledges Stalin for its father and leader
We live happily ever after, as the whole Soviet sphere of influence did under Stalin
As such, we finally deserve to be admitted into the intergalactic federation of planets and are awarded devices of FTL travel and half-life 3
Those damn Poles
Why don't you go with this next time
Calling liars out on their lies isn't paranoia
But I get it that branding dissenters mentally ill is a time-verified Soviet staple
Who shot down MH17 using what equipment
It shows how fragile we are
And i honestly thought nothing worse could happen to innocent people this year
I am sorry Croatia

THe trees don't even move so bad, but all the people fell down
I love how Slovakia is how do I train a cat but if you look little left it’s how do I star in pornos
quality shitpost
Everybody is laughing at us now, but we will laugh when our supreme cat army conquers the world
I'm Slovak and only search on english
No point searching in Slovak for anything
There are some regular flights going to Bratislava airport (from London, Manchester, Edinburgh, Birmingham, Doublin, Kyev, Milan, Moscow, Rome, Sofia), but the best is to fly to Vienna Schwechat airport (has much more connections than BTS airport) and go to Bratislava by a bus or taxi (it's less than one hour journey from the airport - Schwechat airport serves both Vienna and Bratislava)
Hah thanks, why you think that
You are hereby promoted as a first lieutenant in our holy cat war

Fuck it I'm moving to Iceland
This color gradient is really odd
It's difficult to see the differences with the vast majority in the 30s being the red and the few 40s as the purple and the one clear 8
7 in Iceland
Those few extremes make it very monochromatic from 19 in Ireland to 30s in Greece
I would prolly kill myself if I were in France
It's 33C here and I'm wishing for a swift death already
30C+ inside, fan blasting from 30cm on me, yet I still feel like I'm slowly but surely dying
I climbed Kili few years back
I called it "week long steeper walk in the park". It's quite easy climb and the body would be 100 % recoverable
So easy and so nice
Interesting fact, Slovakia is the only EU nation without official Mosque, also islam is not officialy recognised as religion and we never had islam terrorists here
Let us prove that our religion is actually not hateful by stabbing people
Crusade 2
Let’s start with legalizing mocking of religion across Europe
It’s still illegal in a number of countries, e.g. Germany and Poland
A newspaper in Poland got a fine of 30000€ for posting caricature of Jesus 2 years ago
Most countries are not united in their values and traditions
There are huge differences between urban and rural areas, different corners of the same country, minorities that have been in the country for hundreds of years, ....
E.g. I live in Slovakia which can be considered a small country (5
5mil people) and even here there are huge differences between people from the capital, from the South, from the Northwest and East
Differences in traditions, cuisine, religiosity, even language
If we wanted to separate countries on the basis of values and tradition we would need at least 5 times the amount of countries here in Europe, probably a lot more
Slovakia, perhaps Czechia
I think other muslim countries shitting on France right now does not help, they are basically siding with the terrorist
ummm
missed couple kids, didn't they

Why are so many people surprised that there is Tesco in Slovakia
So in Bratislava are those taxi called VB that uses the same paint style as old communist police (verejná bezpečnosť)
I've heard they cause uneasy feelings to some older folks
I can imagine one of them walking out of that tesco with empty shelves, then seeing the orange-white police car and must have thought: fuck this shit, I am out of here
Finally  I'm proud of my country
People are asking what customers can do in response
Buy local and ethically collected honey
Here in Slovakia it is easy to purchase locally collected and produced honey, I know this isn’t true everywhere, but it is a huge step from the companies that replace the honey taken from bees with sugar water to make as large of a profit as possible
My granddad told me that he sometimes instinctively slows down when he sees one of those VB taxis while driving
How is bees dying political lmao
Transported to gulag in 3

Ok, this is epic

The core of such army would have to be combined armies of France, Spain, Poland and Germany because the rest is too irrevelant, corrupt and poor or just Belgian like
Pretty cold today, shitty wind
Uniform weather is when it's the right time to wear an uniform
This really makes me uncomfortable as a person who absolutely despise hot temperatures
Wondering about a way to cool down properly during the inevitable 35+ summer, since the last one was absurdly hot
Dude I feel you, guess the skialp season is over
Feel the pain
It has been freezing in most of Central and Eastern Europe a week ago too, which is unsettling
Yeah it's not over
But lot of the snow melted, so you have to go higher up and I highly doubt that there will be more fresh powder this season
It was nearly 20° here this week
US is more like a rebellious kid that has a complicated relationship with his parents but deep inside he still loves them

damn i’d simp for slovakia

Now imagina czechoslovak hockey team
No, it does not
We are western slavs, in Central Europe
Right there with you
Yes thats true
Due to conflicts in Great Moravia some Moravians moved to Balaton, then further south
As far as I know, Kocel - Pribinas son, is a historical persona in Slovenia
At Slovakia they are much biger and higher and we call ´em mountains
I was at the station exactly one year ago and it was quite chilling to think about what happened at that place not too long ago
It doesnt pay back debt in the first place
The bonds are funded from EU budget
Isnt France projecting some warships in that area of operations precisely to counter Erdogan
what the hell is going on with slovenia, you're tarnishing our reputation
Given German military trackrecord probably biggest help they can offer in there is by not sending anything
Google tells me that for slovak and czech it is derived from the english word of "fashion".
That more people attended protests against the US police system than protests against Islamic terrorism in their own fucking country
IDK, if you have a source, share it
It's just that visually, there's less of them

I'm not even American, and even if I were, I'd hate that orange moron
Your ability to connect things that don't make sense is very interesting
I like the thoughts of a mindless slug
Slovakia=Eastern Europe=racist=Donald Trump
So intelligent
A small mistake : Trzaskowski won in the Masovian Voivodeship
Fuck you -Czechoslovakia
I still can’t believe the honorable and virtuous British Empire flaked on an alliance with another European nation like that and swept it under the rug
That is completely unforgivable
Not only did they dishonor their promise to declare war, but they cut us up behind our backs and didn’t even invite us to the agreement that sealed the fate of our nation
And it was all in vain anyway, all it did was allow Germany to spiral out of control and consolidate enough strength to conquer continental Europe
Worst betrayal of modern European history in my opinion
This is what happens when you find a stranger in the Alps
Wait when you have Russian towels all over the Spain these tourists don’t leave so easily and quickly as German ones
But like all the other rules in Italy, they're pointless because everyone ignores them
Red in flag often represents courage, revolution, hardiness, blood, and/or valor
The sausages, a German classic
The yellow stands for beer, and the black stands for coal right
San Marino has agreement with ECB and even  minted some collectors euro coins
Kosovo is unilaterally using euro and doesn't have any agreement
Is there more
I have never heard anyone say anything about spanish village in slovakia
I think we say it could be chinese
The idiomatic version of 'I don't understand this thing at all' in their language, like 'španělská vesnice' for you and me (and some of the Balkans, TIL)
I've been looking at it for 10 minutes
It's so beautiful
Fucking bribed morons

Hows the car starting
Those damn magyars couldn't just leave huh
Hi from slovakia
This happens in my town too
The store owners complained that their customers or them can't easily park
The solution was to permit only certain owners to park there (surprise surpsire, those were people with large expensive cars
Nah
Here it was weddings and holidays in croatia
Even when wedding celebrations were banned people went to Poland to have wedding parties
Stupidly silly
Even when they wanted to limit it for 30 people max
PM fought for more people
And now he blames other people for these numbers
I've been here couple of times and water was much colder than in Tučepi or Brela for example
Is this normal
Im really upset on the fact that some bright mind came with the idea of assasinating him
Like, could not they think that there will be retaliation
Life was bad before that but became much worser after the act and Heydrich was not really that important
Czech republic were less involved in axis "business" than France was
Hence the name protectorate
Slovaks "won" the victor's side by Slovak national uprising
I dont think something would be different in these affairs if heindrich assasination did not occur
Where did I see those rates before ?
I mean these photos are pretty bullshit because you can capture any moment and push narrative, but it's pretty funny
Don't kink-shame
Can You do a Slovak version too please
One satanist and they have polish fullhouse
Well it's a train, it has multiple doors

Yea, it's a train it has doors every few meters why would you stand close at 1 place,
How tf is this worse in slovakia than in hungary
Oh man i wonder when will it change
At Least people my generation(gen Z)seem to be more appcepting
So maybe in future

Slovakia goes so far that it won't even recognize gay marriage or civil union made in countries where it's legal
Move here and your partner gets degraded to nothing
Yup, part of the reason why I wouldn’t move back

Is it really that bad and depressing how people say it is
I wouldn't mind if it was dark a couple of days
Here in Slovakia in winter it will get dark around 3pm in december
Can someone explain
Woah
It was kinda hot yesterday with 30C in my town, but today tempatures have decresed and its only 23C so that pretty chill
Good luck for everyone 30>
Same here
Looks nice
Experiencing major upvote envy for not sharing my photo of this from August
I think that kind of contrast is why they did it
Fusing the old with the new is a great idea, especially in Europe but it cant be made one
For if you decide on the new, you forget the old and you keep the old there is no new
This way you can get both and pay respects to the old while looking out for the new
V Česku už sneží?
Usually you shouldn't cut it wet
6 million minks

Seriously, why aren't such progressive people as Danes protesting against animal cruelty
Or they just stag-vomit in Prague and make fun of poor Slavs and brag how superior they are
WTF are they even using minks for
EU should just ban it
What did his predecessor do
didn't even have to look at the flair to spot a fellow desolation dweller -"are you saying there was no corruption or crime involved

Why would you bother sitting if you get off after 2-3 stops
They have to submit it for approval
There have been cases when other countries had objections and the coins [had to be altered] or [not issued at all]
They also [tried to alter] our (Slovak) commemorative coin dedicated to saints Cyril and Methodius but we won that battle
>basically a requirement
This is incorrect
Some countries make no commemorative coins most of the time (typically Ireland, Cyprus, Netherlands, Austria), some make one a year (Slovakia, Spain), some make two (most of the rest)
All is perfectly fine, the member states are not required to make them unless it's a common issue (like 10 years of the Euro or 30 years of the EU flag)
Countries are allowed to change motives after 15 years
San Marino did this (to make profit ofc)
I hope it won't happen, Maltese coins are great
Well, you can
By voting
You could not during communism
Hitler didnt brought UK down
Brits did
Also, the money UK doesn't get back directly still goes to other countries which then raise and educate skilled workers who might then decide that UK is a better place where to pay their taxes
Austria, Sweden, France and Slovakia are the best
Slovakia so nuclear
Slovakia is just lesser france
if you gain tons of money by working online, for belgian money while working in belarus, that's a pretty nice boost in everything, plus clearly he did it for his wife as well
there's this british CS:GO commentator who moved to Ukraine with his wife and lives there, so it's not like it doesn't happen or that it's always nonsensical, if you can get fine money from foreigny and spend it within these cheap countries then I'd call that a pretty nice life, especially with all the nice quality produce not tampered by* free europe-wide food market
lmfao that's genius
Yea HAES isn't a thing here and when I was bmi 27-28 my family was quite direct with it
Also at office (smaller office, friendly environment) we make frequent jabs at co-workers that gain weight
It's portion control, my diet past two months was pizza, burger and fries and I still lost weight because I was under 2k calories
Edit: homemade burgers and I keep an eye on other nutrients
Replied to other people that I make my own burgers, have considerably healthy breakfast and keep an eye on nutrients
Explain please
Got me ... What we do for karma ...
My calorie counter app has all nutrients listed in it as well so I'm fine, thanks for your concern
All right, now be a brave person and do the same joke with a mosque in  **Riyadh

Wait, Langoš is Hungarian
It's the only thing you are sure to get in every food stand here in Slovakia (alongside párek v rožku) and it's hungarian
Blasphemy
I used to work with some Hungarians and after 3-4 drinks we always had history discussion, I loved it since we agreed that history should remain in the past

Yep, it's Hungarian
Same with Gulas or Lecso with paprika
I guess I could guess it by the name
I too, played ***Assassin's Creed Revelations***.
Yeah, and the knight ends up taking about 1 gold coin from a giant mountain of said gold coins
That's not what I'd call success
Make the fines real
what illegal thing they did
They still provide good service
I mean that is problem of the laws and anybody would do that
Because why wouldn't they do it if they can
I would do the same, rather then pay my scumbag  corrupt government that just splits it between few friends
There are
No but each of them has multi alternatives
NO they didn't stop lying
Here maps Bing maps, Kindle and the other one
There are alternative appstores
Google Earth is one yea
But that doesn't mean much
Mind the comma, UK !
If you truly want to piss us off, make Slovakia part of Hungary
Also DeutCHe Bank Holdings is amazing
you would have done better if you turned slovakia into hungary too
Oh my god this is amazing
You really nailed it
Would be more insulting to me if you called my county Hungary
You should have made southern Slovakia a part of Hungary
Nah, we need to be called Slovenia
As long as Hungary doesnt have Slovakia, im happy
And access to sea once again
>Nazis in Germany are cheering
Are you serious
You seriously think it would be real to hire people to watch every fucking video uploaded
There is x videos uploaded every second
Google could easily remove all the videos and they would still not break anything
It's private site, for free
Same as if reddit removed your comments
It's not your right to be able to upload videos
Google would probably gladly just allow everything, but they have to do it like this, or they will get constantly sued by media companies
On our bus line between cities, some drivers just turn of the light if it's dark in the morning/night
Great for sleeping
so much powerwashing porn potential
day 7 of international media saying you're protesting against the corona-precautions
same with Belgrade
okay, but what about masks bulgaria
With the coronavirus lockdowns, not only dolphins, turtles and other animals are slowly coming back to cities but also sunlight returns
People actually don't like serbia aye
Putting Slovakia and Slovenia next to each other is just evil
I get that it's alphabetical, but still
Why do they use the wrong flags
When the flag is oriented like this
The cross and stuff should be also rotated on Slovak flag
And Norway ended up a lot richer, safer and more prosperous than Sweden
These Skyrim mods have gone out of hand lately
That is one low quality image lmao, I guess it was made 17 years ago

Every aliance is a good aliance if its not built on lies and deception
I wish EU was allied with US and Russia the same, and maybe in the future with China aswell, when they overthrow the communist government and transfer to something less dictatorish
EU and NATO gives small and otherwise insignificant countries such us mine, security for the future, now we dont have to look behind our backs, and can focus on boosting our economy upwards
Long live the EU, and hopefuly Biden wont dissapoint with NATO and demand bullshit he does not understand, like Trump did
I'll oppose any cooperation with Ukraine as long as they treat their minorities bad
I'll welcome their people coming into Slovakia for work, they are great and hard working people, but the country itself is not that good of a place
Of course you are Serb
2004 was 17 years ago
God damn I hate time
Chill
Well it was written in czech
Poland's at it again
I'm sad nobody wrote them out
I mean seriously, at this point this can't be a coincidence
For example in this map - what's the story here
Historically was there some strong Portugal influence in Russia or vice versa
Or what is going on
Well cars are one thing, but I sincerely admire those trees you have over there, I just wish that Bratislava and other Slovak towns and cities had some as well
I mean they are planting new trees but it’s a long time process and as a result the cities are incredibly hot during summer since there is literally no shadow whatsoever
Anyway, good for Amsterdam, It’s a lovely city
Does Nigel have a dog
Or is he a cat person
Its been real guys
We still love you
I ignored news about brexit, there was something about it in the news all the time
So it's pretty mind-blowing to read an artcle today, that it's really happening, and it's happening on next friday
Does this mean we can finally stop hearing about Brexit every week
Is he sure it's a Hospital ?
This seams like such a childish issue
I mean media using these words is the same meaning as Camps in Poland
OP you forgot to specify in the title that it's **POLISH** death camps
Can we get mods to add it as a flair to clear things up
Thanks
^^/s
As did everybody
WHo cares about idiots that don't know basic history thought in elementary school

Just looking through that window you made brings back memories of my great trips to Greece
Why can’t this god forsaken outbreak just end already

If so, can anyone drop a link to it

Lol nope, EU should not lower it foot standards for anybody

This is why I absolutely adore RTVS in Slovakia
It's become significantly more independent from the local government over the past few years, has very balanced and fair news
The current government actually perceives them as an opposition, but they can't do much about it because for the first time in forever, RTVS is popular
They do good work
I see no problem, everything is true
Oh reminds me of Slovakia in the '90, Mečiar as a strong national leader, who was could fill a stadium of cheering people during campaigns, state television run as a government propaganda channel, oppositions or everybody with any objections were national traitors and sell outs to the west, international critique and concerns were presented as an attack on our statehood and after we were left out from the talks to join the EU and NATO, he said we will focus to the east (russia)
We went through that shit with Vladimir Meciar in 90ies
I hope we won't repeat the same mistake
Because then would poland go bancrupt
God forbid all the poles that are abroad working and sending money home would have to organise work permit
Insane
That's not a shower gel
That's detergent for washing machines

Lord Buckethead was so right
Could it be geezers in the pub were wrong about this
I don't know what to believe anymore
9 lmfao
So I left SOONER than most kids
Wow
Slovacchia wtf
Exactly, and this is called out every time we have this discussion
I left home at 24 after finishing university; most people do
But my permanent residence was still there, because I was only renting a place
Didn't start owning one until few years later, and even then many people just don't care or forget and leave the permanent address at their parents' anyway for years
Absolutely this
When it comes to Slovakia, that map indicates when Slovaks buy property on their own
The Permanent Residency status laws are extremely outdated, and the process of changing your permanent residency is rather involved
It is difficult to get a permanent residency in an apartment, or in your dorm when in high school / college
I moved abroad at the age of 18 and have not lived in Slovakia for 12 years now, own property in the US where I live with my husband
But I am still living at my parents' address as far as the Slovak government is concerned
I don't know how to change it, and I don't care to
My sister moved abroad as an 18 year old as well, she lives in Bratislava with her fiancé now(8 hour train ride from home), but has no way of registering herself at the rented apartment, and she won't change her address until her and her fiancé buy a house next year
So, the data will show her leaving home at the age of 28, even though she will not have lived with my parents for over 10 years by then
I'm 32 and married to a foreigner with residence permit
We both still have our residence addresses at my mother's house, even though we live in a completely different town than her for 5+ years now
The first place we rented didn't allow us to put our addresses there and after we got our own place, we decided to just wait a year more because we would need to change everything to the new address and that takes the major piss
We'll wait until husband has to renew his residency and then get the new one to the new address
Edit : also, the town my mother lives in will implement the 'parking fee per each registered car per address' thing soon
So she would have to pay for two cars' parking even though I'm not even there (we both own cars)
Which is another stupid thing they want to implement
Should just give people residential parking permits so they can buy ad many as they need and not this stupid idea
So, you're saying I need to get an investment property outside of Stockholm that will make it easier to move to Sweden if the dumdum wins the election in November
Huh
I’m Slovak, so no issues there
I’m also joking around, although the conversation about moving to Europe is becoming more real and will definitely become more serious if Donald wins again
Part 2
Just this week it come out that Head of the Slovak National Council, copied his final Final thesis back in 2000
And all he said is that he didn't do anything wrong
Also "anonym" reported to the police that the protest organizators are trying to make a coup
I am proud to be a Slovak
The ones in power see they couldn't stop up, now they try to scare us
It's ironic that they don't see that this is the same as the Velvet Revolution and guess what, they are the baddies
I wonder if they actually can comprehend that
This is kind of stupid since the system against fake degrees was established couple of years ago, so it is not possible to copy academic works of other people and claim as own
This is non-issue
It is more just protest against government :P We have surprisingly warm autumn so maybe people just like to spend evening out with friends and their friends and friends of their friends
Danko made his final project to get academic title in 2000
Few weeks ago media started talking about it
He made it private so nobody could read it
In 1999 there was the same project with the same title and same number of pages, but somehow it'is missing, and in 2001 there was another one and is also made private
After media pressure he finally made it available to public
Result is that he just copied text from 5 books at least, with no sources, presented it as his work
IIRC from 70 pages, 50 were just copied, direct translation from Czech
This person is always center of attention, he is basically meme, because he gets his words mixed up and his sentences don't make much sense
He's always trying to make stupid rules in parliament, to make it harder for opposition, he loves Russia  and usually talks against official Slovak position
And he acts like he is better then everybody, always talks about how everybody should just be calm and quiet
about 1%
We did manage to get PM the fuck out and nearly gave him a stroke
Now, we just need to finish the second part
The guy already went batshit, just push a little more
His landlord just been sentenced to jail and his neighbour is spending nights at max sec prison, looking at lifesentence
He is dead and everyone knows it and as fuck we aint waiting 2 more years until the sentence comes

It aint like they havent been doing for decades now
I love that we get to stay with Czechia, wouldn't have it any other way
also, Hungary
so far away
so sad
As a Slovak who prefers the sea over mountains, I am not complaining
I don't think I could handle living in a flat, mountainless country like Latvia
This is not acceptable, I demand a redo
We got sea
But it's cold :(
Finally a map where you can do linguistic things without Hungary sticking out like a sore thumb
If you can score a house near High or Low Tatras you're golden

Where my undeveloped gang at huh
Is it usual for Netherlands police to not wear uniform or to ride bikes
This video seems too unbelievable to be true
Thats more Czech than German
I think this is the case
The socks in sandals is a trope that our Czech brothers embraced in self-deprecating style of humor
It was also a mark of eastern geek culture
The traditional geek in let's say 1990s in eastern bloc was not somebody with Star Wars or Star Trek t-shirt or some such
He was a guy who wore his father's or grandfather's silon trousers and an old shirt while he was tinkering with his radio or while he wrote some piece of code on paper that he can later test on some old computer at school
And with the rise of status of geeks - when they got good paying jobs as software engineers and so on - this type of fashion somehow also got elevated in status
It is actually a very interesting phenomenon
Making fun of Czechs because of the classic 'Socks&Sandals' duo
You disgust me
What will follow, making fun of Scots and their kilts
^^^^^yes
Who cares, the sentiment matters more, maybe talk about that instead

Fuck leave them alone, they could contain damned souls and 2020 is not over yer
probably that friday night bag of SLOVAKIA chips, which are in reality made in Czech Fucking Republic
might be the biggest scam in history, maybe ever
got no clue honestly, probably logistics or already existing infrastructure making it economically more feasible, also they're exporting into a euro-based country so the Czech crown costs could be theoretically lower
also they're producing crisps, can't imagine they're making tens of millions out of them
idk really
did they rise up against Hungary opression of Slovakia for centuries

In slovakia se just call it Either Easter or Šibačka

This is by far not mostly celebrated in poland
Kupačka
Same in Slovakia
Remember, if you don't throw water on her and she withers, grows sick and dies, that's on you !
actually it does, aside from that water thing the blooming willow is supposed to give the girls power and health
Probably because Poland is the biggest country celebrating it
However the celebration itself is celebrated in many other , mostly Slavic countries

Oh yeah women, always gotta wear make-up

I dont understand who are those people, who are in favour of communism as being a real alternative
Those people are terribly disillusional
I understand those back in the day - as it was "the new shit", and it was at the beginning of industrial revolution
But times has changed, now we know what it looks like and also we are far behind industrial revolution and this just makes no sense in todays society even from philosophical point of view
I also find a bit strange that this comes from "intellectuals". Like what do they think it is going to look like
People working in fields to have food and those "intellectuals" are going to write poems
If you dont have any high demand technical skill, you are the one going to crop vegetables in the fields, so you can start right away, even with no communism
EDIT: For all the fellow communism fans, i feel like i have to mention this: "Me personally, i a fan of capitalism with strong social safety net, for example like scandinavian countries". Also i do believe that as time will progress there will be more and more orientation toward bigger social safety net, and at some point in the future some form of universal basic income will be established, when food production, housing etc
(basic human needs) will be fully automated and very cheap to produce
So less stress on people on the lower income side
Also i fully support public education, national universal healthcare system etc
and i do believe accessible healthcare is a human right
So i am pretty pro-masses i guess, i fully support helping the ones who struggle
Having said that, i dont understand how is this all communism related
Why there is any calling for complete revolution and total change of the only system we know works on a national scale
If there are ANY examples or functioning communism or anything close to it ANYWHERE in the world, feel free to educate me
I am interested in reality and real examples, not some sci-fi philosophical "if-then" scenario
I feel like many people who support communism dont really know how society/country works
There are always going to be people in power
That has nothing to do with socialism, communism, capitalism, fascism, and other similar -isms
People will always construct some social structure, that is the only way we can exist, this is a biological argument
So if your pro-communism support comes from idea of completely abandoning social structures and "equality" that is unbelievably naive
I would love to teleport into the future and see "Crimes committed by capitalism". Oil wars, extreme poverty, people dying from preventable diseases because they can't afford healthcare, sweatshops, inhuman labor conditions and so on
I would love to see that from an outside perspective too
> Oil wars, extreme poverty, people dying from preventable diseases because they can't afford healthcare, sweatshops, inhuman labor conditions and so on
You know you can literally say the same about communism
It is the similar shit I read about environmentalist lefties who praise communism
I would invite them in one of several thousand sites in Slovakia where communist apparatchiks dumped toxic waste in undocumented landfills just to fill quota so they can get promotion for fulfilling the 5-year plan with 120% result
Well
Not really
The unfetter capitalism can work to some degree, even though i would not want to live in such place
I agree, but where did I do this
If communism has to be totalitarian (which i believe is the case at current state of human evolution), then that implies that it will become totalitarian and the government will act this way
I dont want to sound mean or anything, but you seem like an american, meaning - falling for great chants, not to care any deeper
>Yes
Terribly disillusioned with capitalism
Why
I am personally no fan of hardcore capitalism, i am in favour of social democracy per-se, as i can see some flaws with "captialism with no rules", and i strongly oppose consumerism
But social democracy is not communism, that is something COMPLETELY different
>It was never "the new shit", as communist ideas (on national scale) date back to French Revolution (Conspiracy of Equals)
It was the new shit, because it was in the rise of industrial revolution
At the time all the people working were "creating values", the main idea for communism as a nationwide system (which even contradicts itself to great degree) was that, people who work in manufacturing will be owners of the mean of production
But now with fully automated industries it makes zero sense
So those countries with modern communism would end up like venezuela, where 10000 people work in a company that needs only 100 workers
therefore the costs are ridiculous, and the company is not able to compete in worldwide economy
Basically they would produce products to expensive and too uninnovative to be a reasonable buy
Because all the money other companies would put in innovation, they would put in wages for redundant staff
Also the idea that communism means equal is ridiculous
>People still work for wage
Nothing had changed
and what do you them to work for
I dont understand the whole concept
In modern society, a lot of jobs are being and will be automated
There can literally be ONE guy having a multimillion dollar IT company
He doesnt need any other workers to achieve such goal
Why would he split his resources with any other people
Outside of taxation of course
>The same way as it did in USSR is usually "good enough, for a start".
Do you understand that those were sent into fields
I am from a country formerly lead by communists, "intellectuals" were literally the "enemy of the state". They were being called "parasites" and sent to prisons
The whole idea was that workers own the mean of production and rule the society
So if you are not a worker, you will become a worker
That is not just former soviet interpretation of communism, it is The communism
Intellectuals are still being portrayed over here (in eastern europe) as "lazy coffee drinkers". To this very moment, that is the legacy of former soviet era
>The  bit that you do not get is that those intellectuals do not rely on  Right-wing propaganda to form their understanding of USSR or communism
No, because they rely on fairytales they like to make up, completely ignoring reality
Both as the reality of society itself (like people are not going to willingly share their means of production with the ones working less) and also the ACTUAL history of this movement
This is a typical american Black/White attitude - either hardcore capitalism, or communism - nothing in between
BTW do you understand that communism has nothing to do with socialism per-se
In all capitalist countries
Like India, or any third world country with shitty labor laws
Of course capitalism has done a lot of good for *us,* but it would be naive to not see how that affected everyone else
Are you seriously arguing about American atrocities as a counter agument to communism with someone from Serbia
Wow
Just Wow
You must be joking  Please go to estonia teach them how they want USSR back
Wait a moment, so now we use revolutions that lead to end of totalitarian regime as an example for revolution that would lead to a totalitarian regime
The whole point was to make a revolution so people can have freedom of choice and are no longer in totalitarian regime
It is not the same if you use it the other way
I am honestly astonished by some opinions over here
By my "unfetter capitalism can work" i meant it can exist, not that it is right
Unlike communism that can NOT exist unless human beings literally get trough biological evolution
It never will no matter if it is a good idea or a bad one
That has nothing to do with socialism
Me personally i am a fan of big social safety net etc
and i agree with you how ridiculous is US healthcare system etc
but that has NOTHING to do with communism
And saying "capitalism can exist" doesnt mean i am a proponent of such idea
So for again for people who have hard time to read - I DON WANT UNFETTERED CAPITALISM
All i said was - it is realistic, possible
How
Back then, feudalism was pretty much a hardcore capitalism
And it worked to some degree
Show me ONE example of communism to work in functional society in the history
Dont get me wrong, i am not advocate for unfettered capitalism by any stretch of imagination, but what i am saying is: "unfettered capitalism is stupid/wrong, yet still realistic unlike communism, which is not realistic in society based on human beings
Some americans have
You were talking about COMMUNISM, not socialism
Please DO NOT mix those two together
My "american" commentary was unrelated to actually political arguments, i was referring to the "Black or White" way of thinking, where everything is either perfectly good or perfectly wrong
And you just have to pick a side and fight for it
(just to feed my curiosity - are you by any chance british or french, or living in UK or france
Well it depends
Yes, in russia yes
But here in slovakia we had democratic country and communists got into power by coup dtat, and made it totalitarian
It doesnt take majority of the people to make an revolution, that is a wrong assumption
So it can be reversed
It democratic country, revolution is always totalitarian, because otherwise the changes would come from democracy
Well, that looks worse than here
We gotta pump those numbers up
\>70

Actually, Hungary propably has more than Czechia, since a lot of Slovakian pornstars are classified as Czech

I like how the Netherlands are stoned
the word 'pivo' is constructed the same way as 'jedlo' where both mean 'thing to drink/eat'

There was an old regime joke about this, something about never inviting a soviet over because last time we did they only stayed for 20 years
My grandpa told me a story of his from the invasion, he was living in Nové Zámky (south Slovakia) when the invasion happened
He was protesting in the town square when Hungarian tanks rolled in, blocking their way tankman style when one of them opened their hatch, aimed his SMG at him screaming "Im gonna mow you down like a dog"
Its really a shame what happened to the east
Czechoslovakia had powerful economy before WW2, everything got taken apart, communism ruined the rest
And even during communism Czechoslovakia could have achieved much with their "Socialism with human face" if not for the Warsaw pact and USSR ofc
Where would we be now if those fuckers didn't do this

There were demonstrations in the whole country
Sometimes they were individual actions of bravery
For instance at three PM on august 21st 1968 in the town of Zvolen one Jozef Levák lied down in the path of the convoy of tanks
The commander of the column issued an order for the convoy to proceed running over him
There were spontaneous gatherings in other cities
In Bratislava students confronted soviet soldiers who then shoot into the crowd killing three people
In the city of Košice over 400 people built barricades in the city to prevent tanks moving through
The demonstrants threw stones on the armed column
The result was again shooting into the crowd with several shot dead and dozens heavily wounded
A few photos from the incident [here]

I'd believe that this is nothing special
It's the same in basically almost every country
Large cities have different problems and levels of education than little town or villages
Take any political survey map (especially from a country with high level of corruption) and you'll run into same results
And as it was pointed out
It's not that these people are bad or extremely dumb
They are most likely simple people who barely scrape by and then they see lavish lifestyles of people in big cities and obviously they're jealous
Because often, these lifestyles are even paid for from their taxes (and if not, it's usually not an honest way anyway)
Naturally, that's what Erdogan, Putin, Orban, our very own belowed Fico (Slovak Republic) and others do too
But their whole program is based on speaking to those simple people, assuring them they are the ones fighting this plague (often very dramatically, sometimes even sacrificing a lot) and that they're the ones who will stop their misery and make things right for "normal people".
Of course, sooner or later, a huge chunk of these simple people will realize that they were manipulated (or played like A DAMNED FIDDLE
) and
enter extreme right-wing parties
These guys add on to old promise, saying they are *HONESTLY* normal, regular people and that they *WILL* truly and justly deal with *all* those who do bad shit to them
And there we go
All we need to do is make sure people running states are good, honest, uncorruptable people

My mother, who was a child at the time, woke up on a seemingly normal morning, possibly due to commotion, looked out of window and there was a cannon/tank gun pointing right at their window, from a tank stopped on the main street
Way she tells it, it was so close, leaning over the sidewalk, they almost broke the glass pane with the thing
Can't imagine how terrifying that would be
Grandmother told me a story about a Russian tank crew that found it funny aiming the tank gun straight at people driving by and how the tank convoy was following her car for about 20 km aiming directly at her
And yet people here still get furious at you when you say something bad against Russia or Putin
Sir, how are you finding life in the US
As it’s the exact opposite of Czechoslovakia at the time, I would be interested in your perspective
We were threatening the Soviet Union with our democratic reforms of course
Would you be trying to run from someone who is aiming weapon right at you
I don't mean in your general direction, but straight in your face
Not after this
During that week the vast majority of people lost any kind of illusions about communism or socialism and and went into total political lethargy
None of the resistance movements in Czechia or Slovakia, both during ww2 and during CSSR, were politically aligned
They were simply resisting occupation
There were commies and socialists fighting alongside capitalists, as well as centralists fighting alongside autonomists
Yea, sorry
Anyway, it’s one of the most market-driven economies in the world, so my questions are: how are you finding its social side
(That is Health insurance & other types of safety nets that are common in the EU) Do you prefer the US model
Also, the job market, are there any significant differences that you found strange
What do Americans place more importance on, compared to us
Also, probably what I’m most curious about, what were your feelings when emigrating and upon the arrival to the US
I know it’s a lot of questions, but I’ll be thankful for your answers
I'll take this too, as another American Slovak
> How are you finding its social side
(That is Health insurance & other types of safety nets that are common in the EU) Do you prefer the US model
It's an absolute disaster
I have a good job with good benefits, yet I still paid around $5,000 for an emergency room visit
The care is not that much better than Eastern Slovakia, you have to be your own best advocate, both in terms of the care you get, as well as what you are charged
We have tens of millions of people who are uninsured, even more people who are underinsured
There are very few other social safety nets
No federal paid parental leave, no free pre-school or day care, no free colleges, no federally mandated sick leave, or paid leave
It's a complete dystopia at times
Obviously, some states have it better than others, quite a few of these things are finally getting addressed
We also earn A LOT MORE than in Europe (I make around 4 times what I would in Bratislava, 8 times what I would in Michalovce)
> Also, the job market, are there any significant differences that you found strange
What do Americans place more importance on, compared to us
Europeans work to live, Americans live to work
But just like the social safety net, this is changing
The millennials and Gen Xers are not beholden to the corporate world the way Americans used to be, and that's rather nice
There are no contracts in quite a few states - my employer can fire me today for almost no reason
I can leave today, I am not tied to the job at all
It has its advantages, I actually kind of like it
> Also, probably what I’m most curious about, what were your feelings when emigrating and upon the arrival to the US
I expected the adjustment to be much easier than it was
But again, so many things have changed over the last 10 years that I feel much more at home
You could not get a cider, everyone drank crappy beer, there was very little European chocolate, everything was very 1980s even in late 2000s. This has changes, majorly
People are into craft beer, you buy nice quality ice cream instead those 2 gallon tubs of sugary crap
The little things are changing and it's nice
I am here because I got a full ride scholarship to a great school, then fell in love with an American, and stayed here
As a gay man, the life here is fantastic (in a big, liberal city)
And most things that I had the biggest issues with are changing - Colorado just passed 12 weeks of paid parental leave, public pre-schools are expanding, the state is working on a public option for insurance
I have a lot of hope for the US :)
Also, 100% agree with BearStorms
If you make a good living, life here is FABULOUS
Tech gets released early, travel can be cheap, houses are huge, you can get fantastic food, all the concerts, etc
But lower income earners have a much better life in the EU
Resistance of the 1968 occupation wasn't unified, and Prague Spring wasn't uprising
It was series of reforms, which makes it even worse that it was treated this way
Wow, this has been really interesting to read and I’ve definitely learned a lot
Thank you for your perspective and the time it has taken to answer these questions
I wish you all the best
Wow, the no contract part actually scared me quite a bit
But I’m glad that things are changing for the better, and that the quality of the goods and services is getting improved
I actually have the same feeling about Slovakia, so overall great that both countries are improving at this
I would also like to thank you for sharing your perspective, and wish you best of luck
Or something like China and other east asian communist countries like Vietnam
I’m a healthcare marketing manager and my husband is a software engineer
If I knew how to do what corporations do with their money I would do it too
But we can't all live in Monaco like athletes do
And all you get in return is a nice, safe and confident country where everyone gets to pursuit their happiness to the best of their ability
In fact, their system works so well people from other countries migrate there to realise their dreams
Really shameful
Your dreams are different from mine, but then who am I to judge
Well, you know what they say - society grows when old men plant trees whose shade they know they will never enjoy
Luckily for you, there were such old men in The Netherlands a generation or two ago
What kind of old man or woman you'll be, that is up to you
Is this actually true though
Looks like Edward Scissorhands' place
Ah shit, here we go again
I only glanved through the list but I would say any country could achieve 9/10 of those points by themselves
Im so sad these things are happening in EU, we are the pinnacle of humankind yet people come here and cant integrate, because they got their brains wiped clean by somebody who is pulling strings and is too much of a lil´ bitch to actually participate
These "religion leaders" should be find, round up and united with their god
2 are dead, 7 are heavily injured, stop reading garbage
Czechia, Hungary and Poland included but Slovakia isn't? ok
And Slovakia ??
TIL: Slovakia is not part of europe
I looked at the top and bottom first (CZ and PL) and I was curious about Slovakia graph but it seems like it’s not part of Europe anymore
And nothing of value is lost
Also rip the entirety of Luxembourg
The british company demanded a full 50 million pound more then the french one
Their cunt CEO probably thought it was his chance to cash in on that sweet sweet money from the tax dunces, because where else would they get the new all british passport
In France
Then he had the gall to go whine on BBC about it :" I’m going to have to go and face [the print] workers, look them in the whites of the eyes and try and explain to them why the British government thinks it’s a sensible decision to buy French passports not British passports
Yall renovate those buildings
You do realize its the US ambassador, not the one from Saudi Arabia
Let me jump on this bandwagon of EU word maps with the most important word of them all
Comparing curse words is really hard
Every word on this map translates to something different
Kurva means whore, scheisse means shit, etc
I also feel that Kurwa is more used in Poland as opposed to Slovakia
I am from Bratislava and almost every single person I know from Bratislava mostly uses "Piča/Piči/Piče" as a one-word cussword, but it may also depend on which part of the country you are living in
&#x200B;
\- "Piča" is a vulgar word for woman's vagina
Wait bazmeg is a curse word in hungary
We use it to describe a weird thing or a machine
how is it in basque
or do you use the spanish one
KURV4
Russia has majority of people living in Europe, and has capital in Europe
+ they are the biggest ethnicity in Europe (slavs)
They are as european as one can get
I thought it’s a dick
Come to think of it, it is often used when angry so instead of like "I can't get this stupid thing to work"  you would say "I can't get this bazmeg to work"
thanks, that's interesting, i really like basque language lol
And, unsurprisingly, its used same way in Slovakia
We use it like "thing we don't want to waste time remembering how it's called
" When my classmate told me that it's vulgarism I thought she was joking, as there was often mild prank war stemming from language details
I stopped using it after that
122 mil
Russians and only 89 mil
Germans
Russians are slavs, and slavs are European
Isn't it amazing, fellow Europeans, than we can say "Serbian Nigger" is funny translation and no one is being offended or losing their mind
Oh I need a break like this from time to time from other subreddits whre 90 % of stuff is some weird American non-sense that isn't a problem in my country whatsoever
yeah, for example I live in "Brother and Glory"!
It's sooo freaking weird
I didn't believe that was even official for the first year or so
Orange like tin tin

Russia is a tourist destination tho
Your ACs may possibly be the reason why you feel sorry for us now
We want a spot too
Please add us too
I'm so proud of Czechia
They are in cultured society now
I want in there too

Perhaps you could have stated that in the title of the post – that's quite important detail

Czechia and Slovakia is no surprise to me (I am Slovak)
There is a lot of fake news and russian propaganda in our countries
It is not alternative media it is mainstream now (saw the statistics, the most viewed, liked and shared news are the ones from the alt media)
Our government does not know how to tackle it, and even kinda supports this view of the world
The Czech president and Slovak prime minister are against receiving any immigrants and are very anti muslim
We have very little muslim population and most people never saw a black guy
Love my "Czechoslovak" nation
Yup, all red, sounds about right
I have co worker who spends awful amount of time talking about how he would, and I will try to quote "Dig a hole in ground, make it white with lime, and fill it up with ...." Depending on discussion, there are all sorts of people who end up in holes
Excellent little joke he loves to tell during lunch in dining room
Everyone laugh a bit and shrug it off
Sadly, he kind of means it and I can't say I have ever witnessed anyone get indignant over that
How do you even deal with such kind of people
I have to spend whole day with him in one room and I would like to know of a way how to politely tell him to shut the fuck up about it
I'm very good at ignoring other people, but it kind of bothers me that no one ever tells anything to him about it
Wew
I've not really experienced anything negative towards different races
I think it comes down to the fact, that seeing black person for example is really rare
I actually can't remember the last time I've seen non-white person with my own eyes
I remember when I was 10 I was in London for a week and I saw a black guy
It was like seeing an alien to me
I'm pretty sure Czechs and Slovaks thought of Romani/Gypsies when they
were asked about blacks
Most people hate them over here and I haven't met a single person that's racist towards actual black people
"Would you feel comfortable if your child was in a relationship with
"No
Good
Fucking Hungary is more tolerant than us
What the fuck
As a Slovak, this doesn't surprise me at all
Fun fact: We also have literal nazis sitting in our parliament
Would you be comfortable to lower your chance be a donor of e.g. bone marrow if necessary to your grand/child
I don't believe this
They had to ask 50+ yo people
I know my country is infamous for being intolerant, but I have yet to meet someone who has the slightest problem with Asians or Jews
On the other hand I'm familiar with the attitude towards muslims and especially gypsies here
We are so so so sorry
Its not us we swear, its the rest of us thats the problem
Asian, not just vietnamese exclusively, I am sure there aren't such sentiments towards vietnamese if that was the question
Czech-oh-and-Slovakia
perhaps most of those were ignorant racists, but I know many people who do not feel racist but would not want their children to marry people of other culture/religion/race for the sake of at least some kind of preservation (continental/ethnolinguistic/national/subnational)
oh definitely :)))
Why we can't have such nice roads where I live
[ahahaha]
How so
If covid19 has taught us something, its that those stereotypes are true
Polish working from home :D
Fuck them, fucking idiots
Can we have a names
I should have not watched that
Now it's even worse knowing that they even don't doubt about it
Yea sadly there is 0 talk about this here
Not even news sites
Those clowns at CDU absolutely, without hint of a doubt deserve this
i hope the green party will reinstate the nuclear plants that germany closed down for no good reason
Mamy reasons but past few months showed how much its small circle of leadership in ivory tower detests its own voters and party members by installing Laschet to top, despite his opponents in both party and Union races being much more popular
Man, I hope they slip to single digits
Like what are you supposed to do with people like them
Its unreformable
That's sad
So slovakia is as bad as south dakota and everything else is just worse
>8 but not colored white
Error in number or coloring
It is the antislovak propaganda
I can never get over that little chunk of Russia just hanging out there surrounded by Poland and Lithuania

That seems pretty democratic - countries that have Euro like it, countries that do not have Euro, do not like it
Where are all those EU dictators
I love it an would not go back
My theory is it's about national pride and stability
When Slovakia decided to adopt euro the slovak currency (Slovenska Koruna) was very young and had pretty bad reputation
The exchange rate was getting worse every year and at worst it was ~50 SK for 1 eur
I remember people buying dolars and euros in case the situation gets even worse
So, many people said to themselves "So you want to replace our weak currency with something stable and widely accepted
Sign us in
". Long story short, there is little to no nostalgia for Slovenska Koruna and people enjoy benefits of stable single currency
Compared to that, Czechs had different story
Koruna Ceska was (and is) pretty stable currency and is viewed by many Czechs as part of national pride
Czechs are proud of their currency and their central bank is a very respected institution
It's not only about common people, but the shitstorm of Eurocrisis in 2011 convinced many elites (academicians, politicians also people from business) that Euro is a no-go in forseeable future
They are also not afraid to actively use monetary policy
In 2013-2017 crown was not allowed to go beyond 27 CZK/ EUR
This was mainly to prevent deflation
Some politicians criticized this decision, but it was a successful operation
Something similar that Swiss bank did with franc
In short, Czechs trust Czech central bank more than ECB
In Slovakia, Slovak crown was also managed good, but there was less national pride in it
In usual discussions about comparing Slovak and Czech economy and how Slovakia is catching up with Czechia it always included currency comparison
For Slovaks this was always a bittersweet remainder
Czech and Slovak crowns in 1993 started 1:1, but soon Sk was devalued to 1,1 SKK to CZK
Since around 1998 it was devalued to 1,3 and this difference was never equaled since then (it oscillated around 1,2-1,3)
However wages were numerically similar (or sometimes even higher in Czechia), which meant Czechs were richer
Prices were often numerically lower in Czechia which meant they could buy more
From psychological point of view, it was not difficult for Slovaks to say goodbye to crown
I don't like your placement of Austria and Slovenia, it makes it look like Slovenia borders with Slovakia and that Austria has no border with Hungary and Slovakia
You should have made Austria a bit more squishy and wide, so it's closer to Slovakia and Hungary with which is has borders
and put Slovenia below it
Otherwise this must have been fun
Why's my boy Slovakia shaking
Amazing
I find your lack of Prague disturbing
But hey, thanks for remembering that Bratislava exists - that's more than can be said for a lot of people that make augmented maps
Eh, it's fine
Don't worry about it
Would be cool if the city names had alternative/historical names (I'm from Bratislava so maybe *Pressburg* or *Prešporok* would looks good)
Also yea, why is Czech republic full of hugest mountains
Right
Who forgets Prague but adds Bratislava
What sort of fairy land it this
*slow clap*
Russian state TV also made and aired a "documentary" about how the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia prevented an incipient NATO fascist coup, complete with machine gun nests on the roofs&shit
You literally don’t give a shit about Christmas
Those BMW drivers are getting more creative every day
Meanwhile in Bratislava, Slovakia
no way
BMW drivers not using their blinkers
Yes, thats pretty suspicious behaviour, what was she planning
It's called House Attack and it was created by some Austrian artist
Strabag is Austrian construction company and they thought this would look cool on their Slovak headquarter
More info, try Google translate though I'm not sure how helpful it'll be with Slovak language
They do
A huge number of abortions performed in Slovakia is actually done for Polish women
Consequently, Slovak women travel to Austria as Austria allows medical abortion (not just surgical) which Slovakia does not
Has to be pretty nice moment

The only reason my country is so low is because people are willing to go into debt
Im pretty sure this was when he was informed of the German invasion, not the fall of Kiev
Whats up with Estonia
And also how does it work for countries like taiwan, northern cyprus, kosovo, transinistria, crimea etc
I suspect their options are pretty limited
Why do the V4 countries have less countries available than the rest of the EU
Hello Passport seller I am going on vacation and I want your strongest passports
I got my haircut yesterday
Well it looks like finland and ireland have the strongest pasports in the world
Yes, because transnistria, crimea etc
are
right
That was pretty much my point
Fair enough, dont you know by any chance the situation in transnistria

Soon the same cover with the VW company
I hope not
I never used an apple phone and I do not intend to, but they are the only competitor to android
Without apple, google would go all the way to screw the consumer
I am more concerned about the software rather than the hardware
Hardware has competion within non-apple products, operating systems are Android or Apple exclusively
didnt work out for the glorious microsoft windows mobile
Here in Europe iPhones are used mostly by hipsters and businessmen (a smaller percentage)
PCs also make up ~90% compared to Macs, which are mostly used by hipsters, artists and designers
Students, gamers and companies almost always use PCs
I was actually really surprised that it's the other way around in the US
*EDIT: [except the GB apparently]
Sure, but whoever would see this through could make the best OS in the world, the real challenge is to convince the customers to buy in
Its already hard to to make a jump from android or applie because all of your purchases / licenses / etc
It's not, but UK is kind of an exception in this regard
As most of the time anyway
[Here's] a table for 2015 and 2016
And when it comes to central and eastern europe
an iPhone costs as much as an average Joe earns in a month
Would you pay your monthly earnings for a phone
Most people wouldn't.
There are many premium apple stores, that's true
There aren't that many customers in them though
While that might be the case, it's still worth it for the seller
I've noticed that some general electronics stores have one guy dedicated to watch for potential apple customers
He/she hangs out by the apple products and talks to everyone who touches an iPad
Had one try and convince me to buy an iPad instead of a much cheaper Samsung tablet
I mean, I would if I could afford it
Yea it kind of looked nice in that dirty form too
we need to talk more about the hunk of a ~~doctor

What do you mean "republic of china"? Mainland China is not republic, rather postcommunist dictatorship
I can't tell how large this statue is

Great nation, greets from Slovakia

Why isn't this day a holiday in Slovakia
In his memoirs written by Karel Čapek he specifically says his father was slovak and spoke slovak, although he wasn't prominent figure in his life
Some of us would love to, there are proposals to make it, officially, a M. R. Štefánik remembrance day
Sadly, it's not happening in the near future
Thanks, as a Slovak, I appreciate that
Look at our Parliament
Austro-Hungarian Empire was fine (I guess) for Austrians and Hungarians, others were second-rate nations with no influence (in best case) or directly oppressed (in worse case)
Do you realize that Czechoslovak independence from Austria - Hungary was direct consequence of World War
Be careful what you wish for
You'll come back crawling *yet*!
But when they come back and we let them in, it's going to be Slovakioczechia
(laughs awkwardly)
No, I don't think most Slovaks see our common state as oppressive or illegitimate
It just wasn't "our" state and we place the Year One in 1993
It's clear that Czechs were dominant partners in this relationship and this was recognized abroad as well where we all were called just Czechs instead of cumbersome Czechoslovaks
That could've taken a toll on our identity, which was admittedly pretty fragile
For instance in the last census, 6,000 people in Czechia identified as having Czechoslovak ethnicity
The last census where we've had this option was in 1993 and 0 people claimed it
I guess that speaks for itself
Well, in our case we always threw the blame on magyars
Always seen austrians as those wise, rich, ontellectuals over there and hungarians as nationalists who stamped all over us
Austrians get second-hand blame of letting it come so far
But it should be a national holiday imo
Those christian holidays should be scrapped imo
Having a national holiday abouy "seven-pain Maria"? You think anyone even knows what that is about
We dont need any more, we just need more historical ones so kids can have their heroes and not christian ones
But we are the more christian state in Czechoslovakia
The name in English is Our Lady of Sorrows, and yes, you're right
It's a purely Catholic holiday celebrating the patron saint of Slovakia
Its holiday that no one, no one knows what the deal is
Its not special to anyone
Actually, Masaryk's father was Slovak, his mother was Czech

Branik was my starter beer
We really had no big experience with beer at the time, so it all tasted bitter to us
I started my university in Prague drinking that with my buddy, and basically coming to terms with the whole beer taste
We used to call it the beggar's beer considering the price, and IMO it tasted beery enough to us at the time
Nevermind the occasional bad batch, it was still cheaper than some bottled water
Nowadays I am a completely loyal beer person, and I always look back to Branik thinking
wow, I don't want to know what it actually tastes like now that I'm used to finer beers
But still, the beer is my nostalgia
And probably still better than American beer
TIL there were 3 Cod Wars with Iceland
Well their position as key NATO naval base in northern Atlantic might have played a role
These posts always seem slimy to me
As if they're not actually celebrating Poland's independence but instead using an independence day to promote an EU agenda
I so much don't miss UK summers
I remember that temps over 33 were unusual
20° during the night was like special occurring mentioned in news
Downside is increased energy consumption, thus increased carbon footprint, heating the planet that much more
That's a very simplified way of looking at it imho
There are peaks and troughs in energy consumption and currently there's only one way of dealing with them, and that's to have a certain percentage of fast reacting power plants which can regulate their output quickly
Increasing power usage leads also to increased need of these power plants
Furthermore, AC units use quite a lot of electricity and are responsible for many of those peaks
Your power was generated in wind power plants just on paper
You need to consider the whole grid
Unless of course you were totally disconnected from the grid - but that's not true for absolute majority of people
Looks like a good thing
If you can't implement the "this is the list of things we do with your data, do you agree

I love when Dutch start showing off how they are paying so much to the EU

>New York, Singapore, and Hong Kong are also outside of the EU and they do fine as well
They are also outside UK and they do fine as well
And its not just everyone outside financial industry, its also everyone inside
Literally no company in City is talking about increasing their size or shares in City
Next to everyone is weighting between these three options - leave, remain as it is or downgrade
Most leaning to third option with few already opting for first and other thinking about it, pending the result of negotiations to make decision
Yeah, success, this is how it looks like
We don't need to punish them
We don't even have any measures to do so, they're a sovereign country
That's a stupid, stupid narrative created by brexiters so they have something to blame their stupidity on
We just don't need to pamper them
Showing them what the world outside is like isn't punishment, it's just the default state of things
Kinda like not inviting your neighbours to your house for dinner cause they're not family isn't punishment, it's just not granting them privileges that stem from being a family member

I can see this as a background for one of those motivational posters for International Flavors & Fragrances
You can find tons of these "correlations" of random things that have nothing to do with eatch other
The explanation for this is most likely that cocoa is expensive and good quality chocolate is seen as luxurious product and countries with good economics can afford it
As well as put money in science

Here in western Slovakia, the summer of 2019 was pretty bad, well, yesterday I saw 27 degrees when I checked the temperature
Today it was 24 degrees, looking at the forecast tomorrow its supposed to be 14 degrees, and it goes up from that point on, what the fuck is even going on at this point
Like 25 is already like mid-July level temperature, at this rate we are gonna melt in a few weeks
Shame I just found out when it’s almost over :(
We Slovaks have it better than Romanians, most Hungarians in Slovakia like the country and most Hungarian Hungarians barely know we exist
20€ for 600/300 here

That can't be right  that's like dial up
Isn't it Mbps
Does it reach above the sea level
I don't really understand the meaning of your comment
Perhaps you should've written "Spoiler: Germany was winning
At least for a while
**And then Soviets won** *(actual spoiler part of this sentence)*." This is how spoilers work I believe
Maybe I just misunderstood
Oh, damn, yeah you didn't :D
Probably not really today, judging by cars looks pretty old
This map is wrong
Slovakia with them visible borders
Definitely not enough in Slovakia
Plenty cities and towns are simply missing in Slovakia
Just looking at Eastern Slovakia, Kralovsky Chlmec (7000 inhabitants), Velke Kapusany (9000 inhabitants), Trhoviste (2000 inhabitants) are missing
I did some investigation, and Michalovce region should also have dots for following villages: Budkovce (1498 inhabitants), Drahňov (1507), Lastomír (1187), Malčice (1503), Markovce (1017), Moravany (1047), Nacina Ved (1815), Pavlovce nad Uhom (4628), Petrovce nad Laborcom (1063), Pozdišovce (1310), Rakovec nad Ondavou (1072), Vinné (1843), Vrbnica (1163), Zalužice (1171)
So, this map is WILDLY incorrect
3% Britons have not heard about Czechia but only 2% have not heard about Slovakia
We are famous !!
3% for Russia
They still think our county sucks tho :D
Don't be so sure man, Polish minorities are fucking everywhere and they understand at least 50%
/r/ShitAmericansSay
have a turnip, Baldrick
i am not crying, you are
Aw fuck here we go again
There was a thunderstorm a few hours back, it was the last breath of normal weather, here it comes
I looked at this post and I've been shaking since
I'm genuinely terrified of hot weather
I would sell my kidney for an AC
The whole June it was just raining and raining
Portable AC is still expensive and for reasons I'm not going to go into rn I can't really have it
I do have a swamp cooler, but the humidity is too high, so it's awful
And if I make just myself wet, then that lasts maybe 5 minutes
Basically the biggest issue is that there's no solution
Autumn > Spring > Winter > > > > > > > > Summer
BUt we actually can't. We understand, but nobody speaks it
As we speak our own languages between each other, which is pretty weird when you think about it
IT should never be counted in these polls
For Slovakia I guess it's probably Czech, then English, Hungarian, German, Russian, Ukrainian and Romani
Czech is the closest language to our Slovak and we can write, speak and understand it without much problems, because we've been exposed to it since our childhood
English and German are taught at least to some extent at most of our schools as secondary languages used in communication with the foreigners, but we've come a long way since they were introduced to the general population
Most young adults have to take the final exam called 'maturitná skúška' or 'maturita' from English at the end of their secondary education and they can choose to take the final exam from B1 or B2 level
Hungarian, Russian, Ukrainian and Romani are the languages used primarily by the people belonging to one of the main minority groups (Hungarian is the most dominant out of these)
In Slovakia, English is mandatory and you get to choose a third language in bilingual schools: French or German
In Slovakia English is mandatory and then you choose between German and Russian
German is more popular
What do you mean by fluently though
Like its literally changing a letter here and there and then its like a handful of words
If by fluently you mean not making any mistakes then I cant speak any language fluently
I can speak Czech but it sounds like a Slovak speaking Czech but I can do it fluently only stopping to think for a second to find the word for a broom which I imagine wouldnt happen if I would speak Czech more and more
You could have just said that you consider proper grammar to be fluent
I cant write in Slovak and barely manage in English
Also I think poor grammar is both very Slovakian and Czechian and I also doubt those two are words
I do think more Slovaks speak czech than Czechs speak Slovak for example
What's next
Cloverleaf intersection
I don't know what this guy's talking about, but shark finning is banned all over EU:
>Shark finning has been banned in European vessels and waters since 2003
EU regulation was tightened in 2013 to require “all EU vessels to land sharks with their fins still naturally attached to the carcass”, according to Ali Hood, director of conservation at the Plymouth-based Shark Trust
Maybe he really is talking about something else
Maybe he's just repeating what liars told him, who knows
Based Czechia (Bohemia/Moravia/Czech Silesia)
was the Russian administration oppressive when it came to Finland and Finns
I saw gorgeous architecture built there but that's the only thing I can witness, I don't think I can find an unbiased source given I don't speak perkele
ah yes Nikolai II fucking things up as always and leaving a bitter aftertaste lmao
ty for the link, it's good that the autonomy was respected for such a long time
So many airplanes and it is still burning
How big is that fire
Is it biggest in Sweden's history
The irony is that here it is raining for a week or so every day
this can't be accurate
Last year there was 41 degrees in August in Slovakia
Not from romania but screw corruption anyway
Beautiful
How do you pronounce Cochem in German
Like Zochem or like Kochem
Man these will be like 60° C when it's warm
There is oversight and review
They're not uncommon, but the part you don't see is that these public procurement are continuously audited and if discrepancies are found, a corresponding part of the contribution will have to be returned
Example:
If the problems are rampant, the money can even be withheld preventively :
WTF
Why would that be default
Seams stupid
So Santa is actually Hungarian and is greeting everyone with "Snow, snow, snow
" ?
That hurt
Praise the sun
In my considerable experience, France is way off
Fairly accurate, just replace the british flag with american
Yes, but you don't end up speaking it because it's pretentious and weird and not at all like all the american movies from which you actually pick up your accent
What is purchasing power based on
I mean sure food can be a little cheaper, but electronics, cars etc
will cost the same i whole Europe
Which means some people have to work multiple months for something and other just few weeks
People just save more
You save for the whole year to buy something
People can't just buy it, because it's not part of one month salary but more months
We were so nazi that even the real nazis were shocked how good nazis we made
Wait when did that happen
I remember that we invaded Poland so well that Kraut told us to slow down
But I haven’t heard of any big massacres the Slovaks commited
I mean we paid them to take our jews
And our troops were disciplined, always there, always ready
Basically even the nazis that did not believe we could have been germanized were kinda surprised how compatible we were with the 3rd reich and the germans
It would take only 100k german families to fully germanize us
Hungary
I don't hate them, I just want the Pannonian sea back
There's really only two kinds of people I dislike
People who dislike others because of their country of origin and the Dutch
My choice is clear
Do paroma s... Vatikánom
I know Perun is proud and smiling at me
Some time ago, when facebook was just starting to be popular here, there was Slovak facebook group named "we want sea instead of Hungary", so you know
Hungary
Joke's on you, now you have to go around because no boats go through there
you are right we should expand it, Hungary it is
No country, no problem
And here, /r/AskEurope, you have a response from a Hungarian; translation: ''Slovakia does not exist''.
Just after I said that I don't hate them
oh well, nothing new :)
Look I just want us to have a sea in our country, it's not my fault that the sea happened to cover most of their area :D
>"Balaton expansion initiative"
Hahahahahahaha
*2016 flashbacks*
For Hungary it was when our king managed to escape the ottomans,. But he drowned in the river and it forced the kingdom into a two way, latter a three way fight for Hungary
[Ever heard of Lunik IX
] But that's a combination of poverty and a very trashy lifestyle
I wonder if the reason is that not enough consumer products are manufactured in Russia, or way too much of them is exported
the most infamous place in all of Slovakia got even more known thanks to Bald and thats good, i doubt it will ever get solved but the more attention it gets, the more necessary a solution will be
Oh wow
This doesn’t look like Italy at all
More like Slovakia hah
Excuse me, how can you eat a month for 100€-200€ in Norway
Yes
For all I've learned from hobby finger-travelling on Google Earth, Lunik IX might even be worse than Łódź.
I am not sure, perhaps decorations
Well its sunnynthere, so it might be cleaning day, they can dry washed carpets
[Bald] explain
Ah, the nostalgia
I managed to get by with the same as a student, but I am surprised it is doable also in Norway
Do you have Vifon soups there
Yes, definitely
I use English everyday when I’m online, I watch everything in English, I used to attend international - English high school and now I have a few lectures in English in college plus most of my friends are from foreign countries and I talk to them daily
So I basically only use Slovak to talk to my family and well at college
I sometimes completely forget some word in Slovak so I just replace it with the English word, luckily everyone I know can understand English but if I were to speak with someone who doesn’t, it’d be soo hard for me to not include any English words
especially in a casual conversation when some English words I wanna use can’t even be translated into Slovak
And I also find myself translating words from English to Slovak a lot - I know what the English word means but I have no idea how it’s said in Slovak
Not English, but German, my Slovak is slowly deteriorating
Yes
You know it’s bad when you actually think in English instead of your native language
Sometimes, someone asks me something in Slovak and I respond in English
Honestly, many of my friends tell me that I sound American, I don't know if that's true , because you hear yourself differently
But for the most part, I am satisfied with my English accent
I personally do like my accent, or I mean I don’t really have any strong opinion on it since it’s kind of like neutral / American but I do not like the stereotypical Slovak accent
I love ze german accent
No idea, but I personally value freedom Android system gives me
iPhone essentially locks you to use other Apple devices to get the best value out of it
I was genuinely shocked you can't send files over Bluetooth (not like it's something you would use everyday, but there was certain situation where it was the best option)
You need iTunes to sync files while with Android I can just plug it in to any PC and it acts like another drive
Customization is way better on Android as well
And the list goes on
Same here
Iphone is for girls and guys who need to compensate
It's like owning a big car
>I personally value freedom Android system gives me
Unlike americans, we value our freedom highly
I contrary think quite the opposite with camera, i think the newest iphones have the best camera on the market at least for my, but as you mentioned the iOS is the problem for me personally, it is the same with macos, you just have to do things one certain very unnatural way
I'm partly ashamed of Bratislava
I have naturally a bit higher expectations for capital cities, moreover for a place the most of foreign tourists visit it's often not exactly representative
Living in Bratislava now and I can say I liked it better before when I went there only for a trip
First of all, Old Town is really beautiful and the best Bratislava can offer
Besides that perhaps some nature around, Dunaj and that’s it
The other parts are really ugly and not even worth going to (Petrzalka especially)
I am sorry to hear your bad experience
I’ve been to Zilina multiple times and loved it there (though not much to do)
Slovakia is notoriously known for it’s beautiful nature and history (castles, ruins, mountains)
For the next time I recommend seeing Oravsky Podzamok (60km from Zilina), High Tatras (a must), castle in Trencin and Beckov castle
I’ve been to all these and they were magnificent places worth spending time to
Definitely
A lot of people underestimate Slovakia but it has just a plenty of hidden gems
And also is cheap (for german salary) ^^
Germany's personal assistant number 5, who Germany has no idea exists
Goes into a panic attack every time Germany sneezes
Is still in love with his ex
Don't mention hockey in front of him
Really likes working at the company but bitches nonetheless to not seem too eager
Is involved in some shady shit in his personal life, but vows to get his shit together lately
Overall a quiet nonessential personnel in the office
When he remembers he exists during hockey season, Finland likes him for some reason
That guy that is neither popular, nor unpopular
Can lowkey talk about anything with anyone but isn't good at anything in particular
Also always talks about cars
Thanks for the pizza
I do like some American expressions more (like chips instead of crisps) but I want and need to be consistent as a future translator
Bruh I taught myself to speak in a stereotypical British RP accent, cause I hated my native one
Then I spent some time in the US and now it's a mixed mish mash or accents
Lately I caught myself pronouncing some d's in certain words like an Indian, since I have Indian coworkers
Well tap water is free so they caught you on that
I always ask for tap water and never really had a problem
The toilet pay thats usually just like euro and I am glad to give it, because it keeps the place clean and also gives some money to person working there
I have seen public toilets in usa
I would not touch shit there
Its often a place where homeless do drugs and have sex apparently
I am a girl so going to a dirty toilet is bit too much for me
Kajetán (read: kahyetaan)
I didn't even know that the name existed until a politician of said name Made a big scandal with the state's reserves
Sorry if im wrong but didnt Cyril and Methodius invent the alphabet by request of Rastislav of Great Moravia
I thought they invented the base of the language in Great Moravia but when they were exiled by Svätopluk their students invented cyrillic in Bulgaria
the word robot is czech
well yes, but thats essentially what i said, they invented the base of the alphabet - glagolic in great moravia and their students invented cyrilic in bulgaria, i just wasnt sure if cyrilic was a based on glagolic or not
You guys don't have the Soros conspiracy
Basically that any progressive idea is seen as Soros paying people to spread his agenda
Soros is behind everything
Even pays of president
Also chem trails
Oh no, he got UK too
Reading these comments is hell
But this idea is me like, so (I)'m join even if it looks ridiculous
Not know what more say so have yourself beautifully
We are already started the boycott on the pitch yesterday against Cyprus with a shit performance like that
Boycott all sports events, tbh
> shows missing coolness
What is this supposed to mean
We have this guy called Andrej Danko
it is really hard to explain
Basically everything he said/done was stupid
you could do whole documentary series about it ! it's impossible to estimate exactly what's stupidest they said xD
Our former parliament speaker denied we have capitalism in Slovakia
Don't forget our former president, Ivan Gasparovic
"Everything was clearly written down, in white on black
He called the UN (in Slovak it's Organizacia Spojenych Narodov) as Organizacia Spojenych Nadorov (United Tumours)
And more
That dude is legendary for his speaking skills
I also remember how Róbert Fico said: "You can rest assured that I won't be doing politics in 2014 anymore
"I dont need paper when i read" - kpt
Andrej Danko
At least he was honest with his voters
Whats the "work" thing you all germans talk about
Because: Bjork, Sigur Rós, Ásgeir, Ólafur Arnalds
Such a small country with so
many great artists
I never really forget about countries
I mean I barely ever think about countries anyway but yeah
I have never seen you guys in here, hello
Fillibuster always sounded like a type of cop
"Sir the victim was killed by the Fresh Prince of Bel Air"
"Alert all available fillibusters, we have a born and raised Philly to bust
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
TBH no, but seeing this, I remembered I dreamed today about playing with Lego again and I wonder if Lego catalogues are still published
You could still find a stack dating from 1994 to the early 2000s in my children's room
I mean, yeah, Lego is Danish, but close enough
Yes, but only occasionally
Also, they are pretty THICC
And by the way, I also wonder - if you were shown a particular Lego brick and was asked if you owned it; if so, which model did it come from and what other characteristic pieces did the model consist of - would you still be able to tell
I seriously haven't met many
I see we are more like envious of them
At least I am
I am really impressed wirh what Germany managed
Its one of my totally favourite countries in Europe
Most anti german sentiment comes from Kremlin bots and trolls
They are very anti eu and the germany is seen and stabilising nation of EU
But pay no mind to those people
I generally feel it extremely stupid to blame the current generation for what their ancestors did
Its just looking for ways to still be a victim
The same way I don't like a white guilt thing
Because to me it feels like they want to play the victim, and feel súperior to other groups, which the opposite thing we should do
We should work together and not dwell on old history
And thats why I like Germany
Like seriously lost two wars, got absolutely anninhalated and now are one of the most prosperous and stable countries worldwide
And they had become such a puppy that I don't see any aggression coming from the ever again
Plus Germany gives us jobs
And welcomes us in much more than UK ever did
Some people that know history could be angry, but overall people here glorify germans as the hardest workers on the planet earth and say that everything made in Germany is top quality
Many of you probably cant relate, but i thought that "Černá Hora" beer is from Montenegro, because montenegro is literally being called "Čierna Hora" in slovak
Turned out to be czech, for like 800 years
I always thought that Koh-I-Noor Hardmuth was Danish or Norwegian (as Nór means "norwegian person" in Slovak)
Turns out, it's Czech
Robot is from Czech Republic originally
you can look it up  .... edit: I thought we are talking about words where do they come from not brands sorry
football fans know, because RB creates many plastic clubs that everyone is angry on
I knew it was German since a lot of ads, altough dubbed still displayed the original text: "Haribo macht Kinder froh"
What, I thought it was totally Austrian
I would not be able to tell the difference if someone put Porshe, Ferrari and Maseratti jn front of me
So where is Porche from
I also assumed north or Italy
Yes, we still kinda are
We work like china, one country two systems :D
It is actually a great beer, at least i like it
Stuttgart
Well that I didn't expect
And they do look the same to me
I will not be as positive as others
It depends on the country
Western Europe generally benefits from it
Some post communist countries gerelly suffer from it
The reason is either lack of finances or that government/hospital management steal the finances meant for modernization of the hospitals for themselves
Sometimes it's both
E.g. in Slovakia the state of hospitals is alarming
Some buildings are on the edge of collapsing
Doctors and nurses are running away to Czechia or Germany for better work environment and so on
People have higher chance to die or suffer complications from treatable diseases
Regardless of that I think the USA is wealthy enough to make universal healthcare work and benefit from it
The main focus for you should be to regulate prices first tho since even prices for medicine or equipment are several times higher than those in Europe
Doing that could help to make the healthcare more affordable even without government funding
With our reservers of mineral water
We flush toilets with it aswell
There is no running water in Slovakia that you cannot drink
Yes, very common, I do it every day
Our water quality is very good
what you drink daily is not always what you offer to your guests
in Slovakia, guests must get something fine -- alcohol or cola or coffee or mineral water
Drinking tap water is standard
But we love to drink bottled sparkling mineral water
I hate bottled water
With a passion
It is truly one of the most evil things to ever be designed on this planet
It’s fucking atrocious
It makes me so angry
I hope for the sake of our planet you are not one of the people drinking bottled water
Yeah because I use english a lot and I am also taking French lessons, while now trying to pick up some quick Spanish for my trip
I get so confused sometimes
I black on words a lot
Way too often to be bearable for me
Most of the time I'm really ashamed of myself when trying to translate some more complicated text in real time for someone
Few days ago I tried translating text to Slovak for my dad and for the love of god I wasn't able to translate the word "privacy". So I just stood there describing it and waving my hands around until I just gave up and used Google translate
A few people told me to read more books in Slovak
So I tried
And after 4 large books covering history of art I can conclude that I'm a lost cause
For me all the time
, but it generally depends a lot on how did you learn English and how much do you use it
I believe you can learn a language better if you learn the meaning of words in the language itself, as opposed to learning translations, so I started using Oxford/Webster dictionaries instead of English-Slovak dictionary as soon as I could understand them
Also as a Software developer, even when I work for a local company, I use more English than Slovak, because all the documentation for tools I use is in English and the docs/comments/strings we write are usually in English too, because every logical software company knows targeting the whole English speaking word makes more sense than targeting a small country with 5M population
In the capital city of Bratislava – dont talk shit about the city
In the whole country of Slovakia – NEVER refer to us as Eastern Europe
We are Central Europe :D If you start calling Slovakia an eastern european country in Bratislava, in a bar, pub or club, we will get angry
we like to think that we developed pretty quickly after the fall of communism, faster than the eastern nations
Obviously it doesnt matter, but the mentality here is that we work hard to be a developed, modern, western country like France, Germany or Austria, but we are just a few years behind bc of communism
(obviously that's a stretch, but who doesn't dream)
The word felvídek or "upper hungary" is pretty big fight starter
Who the fuck would do that
In Slovak the official name for the Kingdom of the Netherlands is Holandské Kráľovstvo, so yeah
Haha funny language
My most favourite travel experience ever is when we were with a guy from Apulia and he ranted, definitely ranted when he saw a cucumber on a pizza in Bulgaria
Aww going to restaurants with him was always an experience
Miss him
I hate this so badly man
Only you can
We understand each other, so there is no reason to speak a language you can't speak
If you are from CZ, speak Czech, 0 problems with that, everyone will understand you perfectly
If not from CZ, maybe try English since your accent in Czech could complicate things I guess
But we wont get mad over these petty things
<3 Come again
Yeah imhd forums are very toxic :D
Please try again <3
Thank you
Visit again
The city is sick <3
Drink ?
I will kill a child
Never had bad schnitzel
We actually do have an alternative "Nizozemsko" literally meaning "Low Lands" but it is very rarely used, almost always in connection with Benelux as a whole
Keep your smelly horses out of here
Weirdly enough that name is not that hard to pronounce lol
If I pronounce it right that it
Love it
Wine is pretty good, yes
It's no France or Italy, but we have some lesser-known wineyard areas that are considered premium good
Beer is worse, most big brands are owned by Heineken and only the small brewers are worth a shot
Czechs are way better at beer than we are:)
If you have Pilsner Urquell in Norway (it's all over the world), it's like a flagship of all Czech beers, a national pride almost, so I'd definitely recommend it, even though it has nothing to do with Slovakia
Yeah what can you do
They are very obsessed with public transport and sometimes have radical opinions about how the city or public transport should look like - without actually ever doing anything about it
No worries:)
You may get a valaška for that
Edit: Valaška is a weapon, tool and walking stick used by slovaks and rusyns
It is longer, lighter and thinner axe that could have been concealed in your shirt since axes were forbidden to carry around
Jánošík, our folk hero and legend, had a magic valaška which he used to steal from rich and gice to the poor
(Slovak Robin Hood)
> Beer is worse, most big brands are owned by Heineken and only the small brewers are worth a shot
Czechs are way better at beer than we are:)
When compared to Czech beer, it's definitely weaker, but it's not bad at all and since Zlatý Bažant '73 came, it has probably become my favourite mass produced beer, I rank it even higher than Krušovice or Pilsner
Svijany is probably a bit better, though
Ehm if you ever wanna try some good Slovakian beer, I would say, yes small breweries
But Urpiner for me
Tasty and rich and . They have many types, but their 16 can get you pretty wooed in head
I only know 73 from the ads (i work in advertising so I couldnt not notice it), but I will definitely try it:)
I don't think it's funny, but Slovakia is 2nd racist country in Europe
I think 85% Slovaks are very friendly when they are talking to other race
But when they are alone they are talking 20+ minutes about how they met other race human
I knew I would find this here
I mean all other races, for example people who are from other country as Slovakia and has different skin
There is a pack of cigarettes (Camel I believe) that are €2 in slovakia
Reminds me of "my grandpa died in German concentration camp during WW2
he fell down from a gun tower" joke
I don't see it as awkward
What happened, happened
If someone chooses to be bitter about it or judge you based solely on what your ancestors did in different circumstances, it's their fault
I freaking love discussing WW2 with Germans, they are extremely self aware and knowledgeable on the subject
Also often on WW1
Much better than discussing colonialism with Brits
They seem to be a bit dismissive of the existence that
Also of course depends really easy at university where people studied the subject than pub talk
French are really good at self despicable treatment
Also I feel within Europe they are the best when it comes to discussing politics and philosophy on daily basis
Some of thr best philosophy discussions in cafes ever
For us it can get a bit heated when it generational change and Russia related questions
Or Hungarian
But I believe young people, especially the ones i meet on EU exchanges are beyond this and can converse as masters
Basically it's almost always only Hungarians
I remember seeing a lot of comments in Youtube videos about Slovakia claiming : "Slovakia should not exist" or "Felvidék(Northern Hungary aka Slovakia) belong to us".
In certain video game I once said I am from Slovakia(when people asked) and suddenly Hungarians started about how was Trianon unjust etc
Few weeks ago there was Czechoslovak games sale on Steam and ofc there were Hungarians in the comments(Twitter) claiming same things
Hungarians just won't let go of the past no matter what
If I was like them I would still blame them for Magyarization or when they literally attacked Czechoslovakia
But hey why should I blame current people for 100 years old events right
But Hungarians just do not care
I was told that majority of rural Hungary is like that
Ofc not all the Hungarians are the like that
It can also get a bit uncomfortable between Czechs and Slovaks when discussing the Czechoslovak partition and Slovak "independence" after the Munich Betrayal
You mean you guys dont have Russian accent
Like people [here]
To be fair I picked up the fact they speak czech because the narrator told me
I thought it was some other slavic language
But you should see how big russian accent other czech characters had there
Yes, we say ahoj, dobrý deň, nazdar, zdravím, čau
Also we generally greet people in the countryside and small towns
Corruption
In Slovakia on Ester man spill water on girls,  and chase and spank them with sticks
Střílej, střílej
You have just one Slovak politician and that's all you talk about
I can't see how this is going to end in eastern Europe
Torrents stopped over here when new Netflix like websites rised up
And even when it is illegal, no one ever was punished and can't really be, unless it is going to be someone who makes money or of it
People would go nuts if they just cut them off from pirate media
I can't seriously imagine politician or police officer who would try this
I mean

"Bulgarian constant", a term used mostly in construction and engineering, for a number made up ad hoc, in order to formally meet standards or requirements
Edit: more generally, any arbitrary made up number added into a mathematical formula without rational justification, in order to compensate for discrepancy between its theoretical result and practical observation
May also apply to experimental physics, accounting, statistics, macroeconomics, logistics, etc
Maybe I was too specific when I brought up construction workers, because Bulgarian constants are applicable virtually in every field of human activity, like school science projects, when you've accurately measured several related physical quantities, yet somehow they do not fit the formula you are expected to prove; accounting (everyone's favourite), macroeconomical analyses, general statistics
Last month in Slovakia the incompetent opposition won by quite a margin
Keep hoping
BTW I also voted for one of the 5(!) opposition parties
I was also impressed by their portrayal of Kenya
I am no Kenyan so can't patronise it but i lived there and love tge country so much i think the managed to capture the contrast and the classes of Kenya in a fairly good way
Especially liked the women portrayal too, the moderator and his mom work
I met so many amazing women in kenya who were doing a lot for the community, so it was nice to see in American tv
And the matatu wars are kinda true
We say the same about people who study useless majors
(Philosophy etc
Flipping burgers
It's went so far that a pretty big college used it as an ad campaign: "Study in the right place, and you pave your future
Choose the wrong one, aand you're back to flipping burgers
When someone thinks Slovakia and Slovenia is the same country
"Everyone In Slovakia walking the streets is annoyed"
That's what my german/american friend said
My grandpa thinks , that everyone in California carries a Swiss Army Knife because of MacGyver
That's exactly what every tourist sees
Alright, you win
that’s really something
Because we are
Situácia je na piču a to každý vie
I don't know
It's not that empty anymore
I've been there a few days ago and it seemed like all the time
But I'm not a local and I'm wrong
Maybe go visit some other landmarks like Říp or Ještěd.
I would love to know answer to this question as well, especially for places like Curacao or French Guiana
ARTICLE 1
(1) The Slovak Republic is a sovereign, democratic state governed by the rule of
law
It is not bound to any ideology or religion
(2) The Slovak Republic acknowledges and adheres to general rules of
international law, international treaties by which it is bound, and its other international
obligations
Article 1
(1) The Slovak Republic is a sovereign, democratic state governed by the rule of law
It is not bound to any ideology or religion
(2) The Slovak Republic acknowledges and adheres to general rules of international law, international treaties by which it is bound, and its other international obligations
It is pretty similar to Czech Republic, I think because both originated from Czechoslovak constitution
**Article 1:**
The Slovak Republic is a sovereign, democratic and legal state
It is not tied to any ideology or religion
(1) The Slovak Republic is a sovereign, democratic state governed by the rule of law
It is not linked to any ideology, nor religion
(2) The Slovak Republic recognizes and honors general rules of international law, international treaties by which it is bound and its other international obligations
I like that it mentions that our government shouldn't be linked to religion
Also, I like to think that the second part is indirect reference to Czechs whom didn't fulfill Pittsburgh treaty
The Slovak Republic is a sovereign, democratic and legal state
It is not tied to any ideology or religion
It does sound nice, though it would also be nice to have Kirchensteuer and separation of the church and the state
Some of our politicians should re-read this part
Currently, rhere is a loud group of very devout Christians in our parliament who would like to restrict or even *ban* abortion (ĽSNS party comes to my mind- they are basically far-right Christian traditionalists who *really* love to flirt with neonazism and use the word 'liberal' as an insult; there is also a Christian wing in OĽaNO which many people somehow overlooked during the parliamentary elections)
Also, let's not forget that most of the parliament passionately denounced our ombudswoman's report (congressman Vašečka from OĽaNO called it 'rainbowy' for including her complaints about the state of LGBT+ rights in our country, which didn't even make most of the ombudswoman's report)
For example, a few deputies wanted to start a parliament session with Lord's Prayer
[there is nothing more Czech than a pub]

When I visited with a cruise ship of 4,000 people and we all took the commuter trains to Stockholm, people seemed rather confused about our presence and why the train was packed on a Saturday morning
I was just giddy because I love Sweden
Was supposed to spend 4 days around NYE in Stockholm this winter for my 30th, but COVID
Hopefully this year
I have lived for 7 years in Prague
I am also a czech citizen
The roma villages
So the east around Spis
There is a lot of racism against them too
However I would never ever want to be born there
Imagine being a kind and growing up in a really poor place with a different hierarchy and even caste system
And definitely do not want to be a girl born there
The central south of the country
Dying out regions, the highest rates of unemployment, no big towns (the biggest town in the 6 000 km^(2) area is Lučenec with population of less than 28 000), difficult transport options
Being a formerly relatively rich industrial region of Austria-Hungary, the region is full of valuable cultural heritage, nowadays often falling apart in run down towns
The regions suffered from depopulation, decline of industry formerly run by the aristocracy and finally, after the fall of the former regime, lack of job opportunities
The situation seems to be similar on the other side of the border in central northern Hungary, forming a "cross-border" poor region
Another choice would be the easternmost part of the country
Again high unemployment, difficult accessibility, far from the economic core of the country in the west
I feel sorry for the effort the people have to make in order to make living, a lot of people works abroad or in Bratislava, commuting long distances
The East
Wages are much lower, unemployment much higher, alcoholism also much higher, many more ghettos and there is nothing there
One of my closest friends is from Lučenec and he considers it the worst place in the world
Yes, the reason is obviously communism, not the west fucking up east germany after reunification
The fact that we split from Czechia a **long** time ago
90% of the time when I say that I'm from Slovakia the immediate response is "ah, czechoslovakia
And that Czechoslovakia was a federation of two sovereign countries, so the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic existed since 1969
And that there was a so called "Hyphen War" about the new name of Czechoslovakia (Československo) in 1990 after the fall of communism
Slovaks wanted to write the name with a hyphen (Česko-Slovensko)
As a result, the new name was "Czech and Slovak Federative Republic" and in Slovakia, Československo could have been written with a hyphen (Česko-Slovensko)
It is still the only right way to write it in Slovak
And that Czechoslovakia didn't split because people wwanted it - actually, there was no referendum and the surveys showed that the majority in both republics wanted to stay together (just 13% of Czechs and 18% of Slovaks prefered independence)
The split was decided by the new elected politicians in both republics in 1992 (especially the Czech Václav Klaus and the Slovak Vladimír Mečiar), because the two governments had different visions about their common future
Stary dobry Meciar
Firstly, thanks for your effort oh my god
People like you save the European countries
Secondly, your mom is literally **the** stereotype
xD (no offense please)
And thirdly
I mentioned that 90% of the time the response to where I'm from is "ah, czechoslovakia
" well, 9% of all responses is "yugoslavia" - not even close
It was 27 years ago
That's a long time
No, I just have a more objective view of time
The fact that you were 8 then and you still remember it like it was recently does not mean it's not a long time
There's not just one way to look at it- you can look at it from your perspective, the perspective of the human lifespan and universal events for example
From your perspective, it's not a long time
From the perspective of the human lifespan, it's a more than a third of the time a lot of humans will live
And from the perspective of the universe, it's nothing
Yes, the Kingdom of Hungary, which went through over 20 different monarchs in its history
Not taking off your shoes when you get home or for visit
Definitely the same in many other countries, but it's just infuriating
No one posted here a [Kofola ad
Illegal in some countries, lol, for the better I think
That is pretty cool
It's my favourite too now
Slovakia too
Maybe Germany is just behind, dunno
What if you don't want ice
It gets annoying they put ice into everything
I constantly have to ask them to not
And I ask for tap water all the time here and its not actually that bright, as they make it out to be
They also want to sell you more expensive drinks
I am usually the only one drinking water here anyway from my friends
you can create infinite amounts of swear words by flexing the original ones
for example: "jebať" means fuck you can do "ojebať" which can mean fuck with or scam etc
you can have "dojebať" which means destroy something or do a fuckup and then "najebať" which means to punch or harm someone and this goes for every swear and every preposition or idk how you call the hings you put before or behind a stable word to change its meaning
I used to hate the 3 types of D pronunciation when I studied Danish
I literally don't care, I fuck up my sleep cycle regularly every week, so a one hour difference won't bother me
I see, we are relatives in castles then, we have the most castles per capita
I’m sorry if this is a stupid question, but is Trump going to be the only republican candidate
Because I’ve heard a lot about the democratic ones (Sanders, Warren etc
) but nothing about some other republicans
Three cities would be great: **Vienna - Bratislava - Budapest**. Each city has different vibe, they are all connected also via Danube river, surrounded by fields, hills, forests, vineyards
I've seen pretty much most major cities in Europe, and I too think Istanbul would be awesome for this
Marseilles would be great
However where would they drive
But it would be really cool to see the outskirts of Marseilles vs the small old streets in the city centre
Plus it has great atmosphere
And lof of potential for the gangs
> Paul Ricard
Oh, wow I had not idea that existed
That's why I vastly prefer Bratislava
Granted, there are tourist traps there, but there are few and far between compared to Prague
The city serves primarily its inhabitants, and there's cool food, great stores, fun bars, etc
Prague has some amazing architecture and history, but the city center just feels foreign
Outside of that, really cool city
This will be offensive, and I'm sorry, but Copenhagen felt like a more expensive version of Amsterdam with less charm
I did enjoy the city in its own right, I will absolutely come back
I think the issue is that so many people hyped it and I expected the best place on earth, when in reality it was just a cool city
The main train station is embarrassing though
Terrible signage
My short visit to Tallinn has my dirtiest traveling secret - because of the time constraints, we needed to eat something quick and grabbed a meal McD
That's the moment I became a true American tourist (am from Slovakia but living stateside) and I was so embarrassed, but it gave us another hour of being able to sight see on our own and buy some marzipan, which was mediocre and tourist trappy in its own right
While it’s true that the Trianon treaty fucked Hungary quite badly, Hungarians often seem to forget that they were the oppressors before that
Forced hungarization on other nationalities, banning and punishing people for using their own language, pushing for assimilation and so on
And I say this as a half-hungarian with some very proud Hungarians in my family
(I’m not nationalistic at all, to neither side)
I think everybody here knows [Eurotrip] Another gem is [Hostel] Well that's basically all that has ever been mentioned about Slovakia
Thats a very British looking and sounding Dane
I honestly think it would be a good idea to put up a photo cutout board in the center of Bratislava, with the scenery from the movie, and let tourists take photos (for a nickel)
Eurotrip was not that bad to be honest, but it would have been more accurate if they said it was Košice, cause it doesn't look that different than Luník IX
In The Living Daylights, Pierce Brosnan was chased by Verejná Bezpečnosť, across the field between Bratislava and the Austrian border
Slovak company Feckarse Industries supplied a reading board for an ophtalmologicts office in Father Ted
Not just Americans
Ulrich seidl, our own neighbour, made a film Import Export where he went to Slovakia
Okay he went to lunik 9 and the only title he put in there was Slovakia
Nothing else just Lunik 9 is Slovakia
I still don't understand what was the purpose of that scene any, it kinda didn't fit into narrative
The shithole part was him making fun of that time when some guy on tv called you like that, and the whole Europe came to rescue to tell they are stupid for saying that
They shot the KGB headquarters and berlin kgb headquarters in Slovakia too
So noy sure what was actually Russian there
I always make fun of that
First was used a great place to host anime conventions, I used to live near it and the second one is a radio station
I laughed at the pronounciation
Its sounded as Nikoláž with
Not how I remember latvian language sounding from my friends
Even funnier with new hanna the Amazon prime series
I recognised tje beginning part right away as it set in national park Slovakian paradise on a famous viewpoint basically crawling with people taking photos
And it's on lot of posters
I think they were supposed to be in some Polish wilderness or Black forest or something
Its just so funny to imagine wilderness when I know 20 min walk from there is a cottage are and restaurant
After seeing this, I was like, yep they better go back to Finland
Its funny
The film pitch probably went like this
Executive 1: Oh Danish price married a commoner, let use that
Executive 2: Denmark has a prince
Executive 1: You are right no one knows Denmark has monarchy, lets just make him look british
Executive 2: Ok
how do Danish names sound
Like Richard
Or George
Maybe Edward
Executive 1: Yep Edward seems right
Long time ago, I already concluded green mankini and banks with potassium salt would be a goldmine in the center of Nur-Sultan or Almaty
It's something I'd think to hear from Alex Jones
Heh, this is actually pretty common conspiracy with some differences within countries/ethnicities
E.g. the Slavic version I heard says that pharaohs of ancient Egypt were Slavic
It's supposedly proven by DNA tests done on Tutankhamun's mummy
The truth is obviously kept secret by the NWO folks so they can enslave the Slavic people
And even better, I recently heard Chinese version of that (and I actually got a link to Taiwanese article laughing about it):
Also if you meet your cousin once again, send him my warmest greetings and tell him we will make sure to get our lowlands back to reunite Great Slovakia once again (/s)
Oh, jokes, yes, exactly, jokes are what that is
Czech prime minister is actually slovak, funny joke right
Nothing else to see here
Yeah I enjoyed times between wars better, than pre1914
National uprising bros, again
Ha, you wish
What are your offering in exchange
Nie ďakujeme, my ich už máme dostatok
We already do
Think of it as a dinner included
Everytime i go to California Pizza Kitchen i barely eat half, but yaay can take it home and don't have to deal with dinner
Americans are definitely more expressive
Its very easy to pick you up in a crowd too
From the clothes too, but also the way you talk or express yourself
Also so true about being talkative
But also very nice
And yep we do get freaked by your servers
Its just seemed fake
Like all they want is your money
Its a huge contrast, especially if you are used to barely see your server in most of the Europe
Thats the big difference
In here we want them to keep away and keep the distance, in Usa you want them close, because you are used to it
We have 5 days for visiting doctor and 5 day for going to doc with your relatives, mandatory
This is just standart treatment, like dentist
For Slovakia it would be some mining town probably
Kremnica (with the old Hungarian minting press museum) or Banska Stiavnica
Also, If a foreigner wants to experience a bit of cultural mix, he/she could visit western/southern Slovakia
Either Zahorie (mix of czech and slovak culture) or anything under Bratislava (mix of slovak and hungarian)
There's also the whole Burgenland region and Niederosterreich with the vineyards and cute little villages
Hainburg an der Donau is also remarkable because of its city walls and castle
Likewise, the Neusieedler See can provide a great summer holiday for someone, who might think that Balaton is just too overcrowded
Fagot
It means bassoon
Then there is šukať and szukat (Polish)
Both pronounced pretty much the same
In Slovak it means "to fuck" in Polish it means "to search".
Also a bit more innocent one for people who think Slovak and Czech are almost identical
There is a word "kapusta". In Slovak it's cabbage
In Czech it's kale
Another is the word kočka
In Czech it's a cat
In Slovak it's a beautiful girl
I'm sure there's more words like that tho
The word "Gift".
In English it means a present, in German a poison
Otrok in Slovakia means child but in Serbia it means slave, nust be coincidence
In Slovak it means both, cat and crampon
I always thought it's because it resembles cat's claws
Not really, but we do share a lot of news stories and TV programmes with Czechia, not mentioning movie or TV show's Czech dub, since our languages are so intelligible
It's not overwhelming, since our media prefers to cover domestic problems
It is just nice
For minorities like Hungarians, a lot watch Hungarian TV and read Hungarian media instead of Slovak, which creates this sort of feeling of detachment for some
Like my grandma, she watches Hungarian news/TV and reads papers in it
And it's obvious how certain programmes or papers influence her opinion negatively
I once saw a huge governmental ad in one criticizing Brussels and Juncker, and she took it as a fact that the EU is trying to rule us without our input
It's better when they prefer Slovak media, since it's less biased (less than in Hungary), but since people don't speak Slovak well, they rather prefer Hungarian stuff
Depends on the person
A lot of Hungarians here watch and read Hungarian media, but those interested in domestic issues will certainly prefer Slovak media
In our family it's kind of all over the place
When growing up, I mostly watched Hungarian TV, but now I prefer Slovak channels (since our news are let's say
not censored)
But when talking to my grandparents, who prefer Hungarian channels, I can see how it influences them (they say we need a strong ruler like Orban or Putin, migrants are a plague etc
), and even after explaining why they're wrong, they still maintain their old ways
A man can do only so much
Yeah, and I was apparently brainwashed by leftist media and my university
Fun times
I hate overpopulated places, so definitely not the low countries
Weather wise, I hate when it's unbearably hot in the summer, but I also hate it when it's rainy and slushy in the winter
Looking at the map, I would probably love southern Sweden, possibly Gothenburg or Malmo - but I've never been to these places, so there might be things that would put me off that I don't know off
And what’s stopping you
I heard you can communicate pretty well together
Norway is beautiful country and so is Denmark
I hitchhiked from Slovakia all the way to Kristiansand and spend there 1 week in tent in luxury part of town on beach  met a lot of friendly people definitely want to come back
however may I ask you, you surely understand more, what’s the difference between Denmark and Norway
I mean what are the reasons you’d like to immigrate to a dennmark when it’s similar country (at least from my POV)
Reverse one
Couple years back in Istanbul I met a girl who was born and raised in US of A and when she heard me saying that I'm from Slovakia she just happily exclaimed how she is Slovak too given her mother is from Slovakia and father from Czechia
I just thought to myself that its another american who 'really' is European and I just said to her in Slovak "great, so you understand this". She just smiled and replied with distinct Bratislava accent "yeah and couple things more
Turns out she spent all summers until 18 at her grandmother house near Bratislava and learned fluent Slovak
slovak here, we call them farár (priest) or faraón (pharaoh) cards
5°? Depends what "good jacket" is, also depends on the wind and rain/snow
It can be - 10° snowy and no wind so still pretty "hot". And it can be 10° windy AF with cold rain
Weather is not as simple as temperature scale
I dont
I suffer greatly during winter, i really hate that
Now i started to take vitamin D and i feel better, but still hate it
But this year was very warm, probably the best winter of my life in that regard
I kinda look forward to longer nights, actually
The nighttime is pretty kino
[Tell me it ain't.]
We ski
There is a love for skiing here
Ao much that some of us get really sad when the winter is over
Also holidays season and comfort food and cakes
Sometimes I just voted for the lesser evil but there were times when I really believed in a party, even if they maybe didn’t win
But tbh I don’t think that there’s ever been a party that I would 100% agree with on everything
Hard to say if it is declining or increasing
But now it is around 30%.
How about a working with refugees and immigration
Did you have any luck there
I had a social worker friend who did this, especially working with the newcommers and especially helping those with not so nice and pretty sad stories
Or were they requiring the languages
Ok she was from Belgium, but I thought maybe Netherlands can be similar
Oh damn
I am sorry
Yeah I guess they only can pay for some depending on money allocation
But it sucks they wotn pay you for all the work
And I agree so competitive
However, awesome job you are doing, that is definitely not easy to work in this field
Good luck in your job search
I will be the other way soon (moving to us) well if I manage to travel
And I am scared about jobs too
When someone says that we are upper Hungary
If you say that in front of slovaks, be prepared to be burned at stake
When foreigners think we are still Czechoslovakia or we speak Russian
And when somebody thinks Slovakia is same as Slovenia
(or when our Czech bros calling us Hungarians
we feel you
now why overcomplicate it, we'd be Slovenkia and the only thing standing in the way of this happening is Austria tbh, but we're willing to embrace them and their developed infrastructure
you know you officially renamed yourselves to Czechia couple years back, right
I'm still not used to it
Interesting thing is that Netherlands in slovak language is "Holandsko".
the feelings may not be mutual atm
World’s highest number of castles and chateaux per capita, appearantly
~~(**Slovakia** - how do I get flair
)~~
> Just imagine an incredible number of 180 castles and 425 chateaux in a country with the entire population far smaller than the city of New York
I see this as a positive thing tho
Most of the world wasn't properly prepared
And while many other countries simply say that protective equipment should be used by sick people only (since they don't have enough of them to be used by everyone), people in Czechia and Slovakia simply craft them themselves
This is actually something people abroad should take as an example
I agree that this crisis shown how unprepared nations across the globe are
This is not only Czechia
This is almost every country
Simply because it's first time we experience this
Last huge pandemic hitting Europe was Spanish flu hundred years ago
I'm pretty sure we will be way better prepared for the next one
Take Taiwan as an example
They were hit extremely hard with SARS outbreak few years ago
They were also unprepared back than
But today they are the nation which is handling this pandemic the best
So in this perspective I'm quite positive about this
It shows that our people are eager to fight together
That's always a good thing
Regarding war - that's where NATO and collective defenses should come in
Ehm what
Various studies show that it helps decreasing the spread of this type of illnesses
Just search for studies focusing on community spread rather than individual protection
Face mask isn't meant to protect you, it's meant to protect others
Again, ehm what
Even that article claims it's better than nothing
I definitely saw more boobs 10-15 years ago, although that's probably because I was in my early 20s, while now I am just married
Omg indeed
I never really realized how expensive Lego was for people with average wages
My brother used to have hundreds of sets, I never looked at prices since I was a kid back then too
I definitely think it should be cheaper
*equivocation*
That's not very Anglish ;D More like Italian
English without the Latin words is much better
The Latin words feel foreign
It's a shame that you thrown out many of your own words and use Latin based words instead
Words like *equivocation* sound off in English
In everyday life nobody is using words like 'equivocal'. In daily life the 'for hundred' thing is less than 80
In Slovakia during march, we are burning and drowning [Morena] , pagan goddes of  winter and death
Its symbol of ending winter and new life
Also during Spring there are other fests as [Fašiangy] for instance where are people dresing in various costumes and other fun stuff
r/JuropijanSpeling a bit
Mussolini was just desperatly trying not to look like a bitch in front of hitler lol
There's a guy on youtube, can't link on mobile
Historia Civilis is the channel name and he has a video about "Constitution of Sparta". It's really great despite the boring name
I don't have any sources, but my friend is a historian and last time I asked him he said it went something like this:
Basically there was a huge expulsion after WW1, especially in Bratislava and the west, mostly of Germans and Hungarians
This was however limited to Bratislava itself since the people in charge wanted to make it a capital (before that, Pressburg was about 40% German speaking, 30% Hungarian speaking and the rest Czech/Slovak)
So after Bratislava was "ethnically cleansed" (expulsion kind not murder kind) there was an agreement with Hungary to swap people
But there were more Hungarians in southern Slovakia than Slovaks (and still are to this day) so the rest could stay
During WW2 the south was occupied by Hungary and a lot of people from Hungary moved in, since they thought it's gonna be Hungarian now (which was guaranteed by Hitler at the time)
So now we have almost no Slovaks in Hungary and "exchanged Hungarians" back in South Slovakia and then some
After WW2 there was a resettlement of the "additional" people that came in, but the situation got complicated and after an agreement with Hungary, they were allowed to stay
Interesting is the ratio of Slovaks-to-Hungarians in Dunajská Streda, a city in "the south" that is however close to Bratislava and quite representative of the whole area
In 1914 it was like 70H-10S,the rest Czech and German
1935 would be about 60H-40S
1942 90H-10S
1948 still about 85-15
2019 about 50-50 because of people from Bratislava moving in and a lot of young people blurring the line between ethnicities, speaking both languages
Hungarians weren't on the same level as Germans, but yes, it is sad that some fuck can't accept that we did some bad shit too
On the other hand, nearly 20% of the population is proud of the puppet Slovak state and it's actions, so I'm not that suprised about their ignorance towards Hungarians
>...Slovak government basically ignores this and it’s not even taught in history classes
Considering we barelly touched WW2, I'm happy some kids heard about the Holocaust at least
Does any language have a specific word for that dull feeling people get on Sunday evening, thinking about going to work/school the next morning, realizing it's still their leisure time, but it's too late to travel anywhere, start working on a major thing around the household or, foremost, get drunk
I swear I had gut feeling Swedish would be the language
Odkedy v Poľsku voláte nedeľu piatok
What would be the term when you are actually unemployed, you know that the only thing that can happen to you on Monday is that an HR person will call you to schedule a job interview, and you feel like getting drunk, but you've been drinking the previous three evenings and you know you should take a break at least from time to time
That isn't even pseudo-Czech, that's just normal Czech with one little typo
We use this term in Colorado
Correctly in Czech it is "Neděle večer a humor por*ou*chaný"
In Slovak "Nedeľa večer a humor pokazený"
Strangely, Slovak does have the noun "porucha" which means outage just like in Czech, but there is no such adjective as "porúchaný" in use in common speech, although it would be generally comprehensible and even feel Slovak, indeed
We beat women with a stick made out of willow branches and throw bucket of cold water on them during Easter Monday and then we get chocolate eggs and money in return
Logic
Also known as Morena/Morana in other countries, she's kind off like a slavic goddes of death
Where I come from she's ussually burned and thrown to river, which means the winter has ended, the time has come for spring and the renewal of life
this is amazing
In Slovakia we do it everywhere
We also call it “Morena”
A Slovak that doesn't complain about everything (even made up things)
Or a Czech who doesn’t say "ty vole" in every other sentence
How dare you
In Slovak:
Slnko = Sun (neutral)
Mesiac = Moon (masculine)
hviezda = star (feminine)
I think it depends on the ending of the word: words ending with -a are usually feminine, with -o are usually neutral and with a consonant are usually masculine
The Moon is usually depicted as male (but in arts, the Moon is called also Luna, feminine) and the stars are usually depicted as girls
The Sun is neutral, non-specific (like [this] but it can be depicted as male ([this] or female ([this] Or they all can be anything ([this] I feel like there is not just one option
But the neutral is not really a problem, because, for example, the word "girl" (dievča) or "baby" (dieťa) is gramatically neutral too
Slovak: To slnko (it - middle gender) Ten Mesiac (he - male gender)
In Slovak, the Sun - to Slnko (neutral), the Moon - ten Mesiac (masculine) and the Earth is - tá Zem (feminine)
English does use gender for some inanimate objects but in an associative way, even for some abstract concepts
The things that are associated with harsh or extreme features have the masculine associated (Sun, death, Summer, Winter) while things with moderate or pleasant features have the feminine assocated (Moon, Spring, Autumn, mercy)
There are other examples like political units or nations having feminine associated while plain geographical locations are neuter (might have mixed up those in a way, though)
I agree with that, definitely
Weed needs a certain temperature to make someone or smething high, so unfortunately they were not high
>Suspect: Yes yes yeahhhhhhh
I read this shit in Salamanderman's voice
[This glorious filth]
Depends on your job I feel like but I think German, French, Russian and Spanish could be useful
It is the shit
I am totally playing it to my kid one day
With pingu and moomins and tin tin
If I ever have a kid
My mom used to do the same thing
She left me sleep on balcony in cold
Apparently i slept very well
Better than usual
Unfortunately I lost my cold resistance after I discovered hot showers and local hot springs
Do I really see a hyphen
Did we just won the [Hyphen war]
Its something you romance languages can't appreciate
On the other hand, I often have problems pronouncing french words because I just get lost in all those vowels
Dude everyone has breweries now
My hometown of 27 thousands has like 4 around
We are talking about mainstream and mass produced beer
Not about breweries
We know local ones are good
Craft thing is absolutely a thing everywhere in the world
I love how languages works as this
I love the sound of romance languages as french, spanish or romanian because it sounds softer more melodic to me
Actually we use r as some kind of a vowel
Also the reason why it is so prevalent in those words
Yes this, thank you
And thats the fact I learned on reddit, because obviously I was not paying attention in school
Maybe Jozef Tiso, he was the Slovak president during WW2, basically the Slovak Führer, however, he is very controversial from both sides
He wasn't a nazi in conviction, he wasn't as radical as other people in the gover ment at that time (like Vojtech Tuka) and probably allowed attrocities so he doesn't get replaced for someone much more radical who would go out of their way to commit attrocities, as opposed to the "required" ones (we were forces to be a German ally at that time)
Therefore I'd suggest to paint his as neither a hero nor a genocidal maniac
Probably Jozef Tiso, president during WW2 that is responsible for sending thousands of Jews and others to Hitler
He was basically Hitler's bitch
But many people see him also as a national hero, just because he managed to keep Slovakia's existence as a German puppet state and we were "prosperous".
In our country is probably Jozef Tiso (presidend of Slovak State during WW2) or Vladimir Mečiar (First prime mimister of Slovakia)
The old witch is dead
The only people that i know and learned my native language(slovak) and speak it without the accent are from other slavic nations (for example Polish) but still you can hear it maybe not from the accent but from the choice of words
One Indian chef that moved to Slovakia speaks very good Slovak though and I would not know he is not Slovak because he makes no mistakes and his accent is pretty decent
As there are many Hungarians living in Slovakia, hungarian accent is pretty common in Tv (actors with hungarian ancestry) and even though they live in Slovakia their whole life sometimes they struggle to not to have proper accent and, exactly, mostly because the vowels are different in Hungarian
But nobody really cares because its very common
Even though i can say only few words in hungarian, i am definitely goulash-gobbling lángos-loving paprikaphile
Hungarian cuisine is one of the best
I read that Basque is one of the most difficult languages to learn and to be at native's level
Are there many people who learn it
Yes, also most of the Slovaks have their accent in czech even though they live there for many years and were exposed to language since childhood
I met maybe 2 or 3 people who I could not tell they were Slovaks
Its always about the same words we share, then they always switch to a slovak pronunciation
Best example is your PM
Thank you Czechia  for being a big brother to us, and also for your delicious beer (best in the world)
Poland for saving us from Ottomans in battle of  Wien
Thanks Slovenia for sending us mail each year that was wrongly sent to you, instead of us
I second this, thank you
Thanks Czechia for your amazing beer and humour ️
Nothing changed since 1700, still not interesting enough for average european
I’d remarry you any time
Didnt the revolution cause the split of austria into austria-hungary
I always thought the revolution was a success for the hungarians (as we slovaks sided with austrians and were promised recognition and got nothing) but i guess if it really was a succes hungary would be completely independent
Well, being incapable of properly representing and recognizing its vast minorities was the downfall of austria hungary and by start of ww1 it was already too late
Czech and Slovak are so similar we understand each other
Polish is more distant for us but there are some words we can comprehend and put into a meaning
I can understand Czechs fluently and vise versa
With some effort I can also understand Polish
Yeah, Polish would be better understood by Slovaks, especially those familiar with eastern-slovak dialect
That being said, Slovaks and Czechs can easily understand each other, I dare to say our understaning is the best between all Slavic languages
Our languages are very similar + we are highly exposed to one another so there barely any problems with conversation
But speaking of one Czechoslovak would not be possible
Maybe some centuries earlier yes, but now  we're too different for it to be just "dialects".
What are the differences between them
As a Slovak, I can't imagine 2 languages being even closer without being just dialects of one language
But then again, I know virtually nothing of the Balkan area
I think there was an immigration of Croats into Slovakia in the former Kingdom of Hungary
We have many people whose last names are “Horváth” and a village called like Chorvátsky Grob
Therefore I think this could be a reason why we understand each other a little better
That's cheating then, innit mate
Just kidding
That's interesting, I didn't know that, thanks for enlightening me
News channel has 30 minutes segments
Or if that the US news are maybe 2-3 minutes (riots, disasters, Trump making idiot of himself and so on)
If something serious with worldwide impact happened it can be more
weekly news mostly "orange man did bad thing" or "someone died because of guns"
I have learnt so much here
Like seriously
Those small things you had no idea that existed, will be mentioned and you are like oh Finns do that, I had no idea
Also people are funny here
Yes
I’ve met people from several other continents and the cultural shock that I’ve experienced compared to the one that I’ve had with people from other parts of Europe was tremendous
You might say that western and Eastern Europe have different traditions and ideas but we’re fundamentally the same deep down, as there’s not that many things that we differ in
It’s just two sides of the same coin while with the rest of the world it would be two entirely different coins
It’s only nationalism that drives a deep divide between us in my opinion
Without it we’d be much closer and I think that the EU is sort of bridging that gap
I am proud that I was born in Europe and can call myself European Citizen
Unfortunately, I am not proud about my Slovak Nationality
I think there’s strength in numbers and that cultures aren’t associated with language or country
I definitely identify more as European than as a Slovak
I can see huge culture differences between far-away places in any country and vague culture similarities between nearby countries
Same thing goes with dialects
Western Slovak is much more close to Moravian dialects than to Eastern Slovak ones
I would love to see European Union truly united and separated into truly culturally-based subregions which would have equal footing
Yes I believe that you can relate more to European people and customs than outside people and stuff
However, do I believe that there should be only European identity
Hell NO
I’m proud of my country and I won’t denounce my heritage
Can you describe it
Most of these sound as expected
> Way bigger divide between men and women(feeling only really but as a 20 year old guy the entire thing was kind of creepy on more than one occasion
Some things American women seemed to be ok with that would just not fly over here)
Like what
Bratislava
Well thats probably the only place people go into
I personally like Bratislava, but I can see how it may be boring to people
Its definitely small
I lived there so I know the good spots but its not like the tourists will find those
The true fun is outside
Freaking lot of castles, lot of parks, old towns and some mountains
We dont really get much tourists unless its our neighbours
Czechs know better where to go anyway
But some still should wear better shoes to Tatras
My most favourite moments is when Czech, Slovak and Pole sit behind the same table in one of Tatra cottages, drinking beer after a hike
And there seem to be some occasional lost German there
Generally people seem to bypass us constantly while doing their eastern europe trips, so it actually gets suprising when you meet someone who isn't czech, polish or Hungarian or  Ukrainian
Shoot out to Romanians, I have met some
But we definitely could do with less stag parties in Bratislava
It's such a terrible place
In the morning it smells of piss and vomit
Full of young Brits making a mess, trash everywhere
at least the beach looks good
Although I've heard that a lot depends on where you're residing (hotel or resort)
I never want to visit that place again
The only thing, which sort of saved it was Nesebar, that town is just beautiful
Because Croats are very friendly and helpful people
Plus we Slovaks like to go there, because Croatia is culturally and aesthetic wise similar to Slovakia
Except you have a sea too
Which is a huge bonus
I just love your people
The best thing after a long day is to sit down with the appartment owners, chat and have some rakija
Same
I've heard so many good things about it, and I desperately wanted to visit it
When I got a chance (in the off season) due to work, I went there
The old town is just amazing
I loved it
The bridge, the castle and the squares
simply beautiful
The rest though
Bratislava 2
I don't mean to be rude, but the rest is grey, colorless, socialist looking city, with a lot of sketchy areas (similar to those in Bratislava)
Since I understand Czech I was able to find some very cheap places to eat at and visit, but other than that it wasn't pretty
And what the hell is up with all those sellers and homeless people on the sidewalks
Seemed very weird
Brno remains my favorite Czech city
I am glad you liked it
And it probably was kc dunaj
Its one of my favourite clubs too
They do great events
Is it
I thought it was totally crowded lately
Last year Strbske Pleso was so crowded
But maybe because there is other hiking spots
There is low tatras, then Slovenský raj, Karpaty, mala fatra velka Fatra
Lots of hiking spots, so maybe people who get bored of Tatras go there
It really is
And it's such a shame too
You may have been lucky
But most of the popular spots get crowded, but when you leave the easier tourists trails, it can get quite deserted
But I haven't been to polish side in years, gotta change it soon
Thats actually a great idea
I mean, we planned to go hiking to Italy this year, but you know, and this seems like a great alternative
Hmm, i must have been sleeping to hard, i didnt felt it
For me it was totally LA and Vegas
Huge disappointment
LA was dirty and full of homelesness and so much traffic with really bad public transport
The people and how they dress too
Its all very superficial
And the walk of fame, just a dirty street full of people stuffing you with their rapper CD or people selling tours to see stars houses
However the other parts of it as Santa Monica and Long Beach are nice
However I got recommended some museums, so will check them later
Vegas also, is not for me
Strip is just full of people and lots of gambling
Could not afford the shows, but maybe some other time
The moment you leave the strip so many weirdos on street
Lot of super expensive parties and people basically glued to each other in pools
Not my thing at all
But well was supposed to be at EDC now, so thats a bummer, because that looks awesome
The best appeal of Vegas for me its the location to national parks
Those are the true wonder
Not far to Zion, red rock Canyon and tge Grand canyon
Also Dubai went past me
It fels like a fake city
I guess if you love malls and really expensive alcohol
Also not a big fan of sunny beach in Bulgaria
Especially as there are much better places there
Just these resorts are meh
Agreed
Totally visit Jordan
One of the most beautiful places I ever been to
Wadi rum is like another world
Also heard great things about Oman
Lots of female travellers got there alone and loved it
Also Lebanon
Do you have any recommendations
Some maybe more artsy places, or something like that
And I totally agree on food
Love the food
However the traffic, nope cant get used to it
There were a 5 lines in one direction and they were all full
I am sorry for all the drunk and noisy tourists you guys get there
It totally is
Its the successful parts and the failed parts in one
Holywood . That's pretty much it
Its has the fame aspect, its the biz
I don't get it either, especially if two hours away there is San Diego with much better everything
Beautiful beaches, great people and the Old Town and one dollar tortillas
German: Kurve (curve)
Slavic languages: Kurva (bitch)
We have legendary polish words
Szukat their looking for means to fuck in Slovakia and Czech Republic
Also found out zachod which means toilet here its a west in polish
It was very confusing map for me at the beginning
Also bojsko, means a playground in Polish, here it means warzone
Was confused when a kid asked where it is
I was like wtf you want to do
Slovak - Russian
Zápach (bad smell) and Vôňa (good smell) have opposite meanings
Späť means backwards in Slovak
"Krásny život" in slovak means "beautiful life"
"krasnyj život" in russian means "red belly"
I don’t wanna sound like a whining baby but I really don’t like living in Slovakia
Personally, I actually didn’t click with the culture, traditions, people as well as the system
Other than that Slovakia is seriously backwards in almost everything
Almost nothing works properly
The school and healthcare system are not the worst, but far from ideal
Salaries are quite low for ordinary people
There is quite a high rate of qualified slovaks each year who decide to move out because they hate the system
TL:DR: Slovakia - Not the worst, far from the ideal
I really like living here
I once wanted to move so badly when I was younger because I though it's shit here, but almost every country has it's annoying flaws
I am quite fine with where I am and even the political climate is getting actually better
As for Slovakia, we are alright i guess
We are landlocked, which is unfortunate, tho in the past as part of the Kingdom of Hungary, perhaps the Habsburg Monarchy as well, we had an access to sea
Not too many slovaks could use it though
For our neighbours: the Czechs are good
The Hungarians, well a teeny bit too nationalistic, but I personally prefer the old borders, so I dont mind
The Poles, I dont know much about really
We share the Tatra Mountains (tho we have the bigger part, alright)
More slovaks from Orava could say more about the poles I guess
For Austria
Yeah, we go to work and shop there
They have got better salaries and prices, and better quality of products sold
For example even tho I am all the way from Trenčín, I sometimes find myself shop there
And Ukraine
That I dont know anything about, other than that they sometimes illegaly try to get cigarettes trough the border
Our landscapes are of 2 types- the Mountains and the Lowlands (I dont know the english word)
The Lowlands are in the southwest, and other than that mixed between some mountain ranges
Then the mountains are everywhere else really, if we dont take the other smaller lowlands
The Carphatian mountains are really big force in here
The weather is pretty normal for Central Europe (-10 to 5 degrees during the Winter, 25 to 35 during summer)
Rains are more rare than sunny day or cloudy ones, but we dont have any problems with that
I would say something about industry too, but I now absolutely forgot everything, for some reason
But I know our 2 main companies in industry sector are Slovnaft in Bratislava (Slovak fuel refinery) and USS in Košice (United States Steel- The name speaks for itself pretty much)
Pretty much the same over here, if only there was another slovakia with a sea bordering austria and hungary
The funniest I heard was to call a press conference, as press conference in Slovak is tlačovka and pushing  is tlačiť and press is tlač
They used to be extremely popular, together with Skoda 120
Even during the 90s and early 2000s the Ladas had a reputation of being easy to repair and maintain, which was a godsend to poorer families
We had one
If you took care of it, that car could put the newer one's to shame
But of course in the long term' they all rusted and broke down:/
No joke, my dad's old firm used Lada Nivas to rescue stuck off road cars in the forests and mountains
That car is surprisingly sturdy
I think the 2009 cash for clunkers policy in Slovakia made it dissappear, finally
I remember a bunch of 80s and 90s cars on the roads in the mid 2000s, those are mostly all gone
Seeing a Škoda Felicia is a rare thing, even in the poorer parts of Slovakia
Let alone a Lada
Not in person, but for all the people wo put ketchup on langos please stop
He can still drink a kofola
The Slovaks love it
Most of the slovaks
I think he meant kofola
Same in Slovakia, we use "svetlé pivo" (light beer) for beers of yellow-ish colour
Oh I perfectly fit into mine
I just feel like everyone else does not
Well we drink on every occasion possible, birthday, holiday, wedding, funeral, family meeting, friends meeting, meeting new people, celebrating Friday, being in bad mood, being in good mood, just to get drunk, getting a new job, loosing a job, getting a paycheck, drinking with last money etc
I mean what do you expect from former CCCP countries  usually if you don’t drink you are the weird one here
When you drink, its because you are thirsty, either for sustenance or for experiences
In Eastern Europe, you see a lot of them
Pictures of Jesus, church promotions
Its everywhere
How I envy you
Some examples:
It's usually in rural areas (which to be fair are very common since half of our population lives outside of cities and the number keeps increasing)
But yeah, a prety sizeable part takes religion seriously here
Billboards are mostly stuff like God wants to help you, Let God enter your life, Jesus is here for you and so on
But there are also some more "aggresive" or "in your face" ones, such as this one:
[But whoever denies me before men, I also will deny before my Father who is in heaven] - for context, we've had our national population survey during the last months and this is a response to a movement against proclaiming yourself catholic if you don't even go to church so as not to support the Church neither financially nor with soft power to support policies such as antiabortion or anti free speech laws
When there is a billboard in a city, it often ends up like this:
[- Why did you abandon me
- Because you don't exist
Unfortunately, religion is still big in rural areas and some politicians are elected only because their voters are super religious - thats why they push this agenda everywhere
I hope with the recent population survey the number of believers will drop,.
Definitely Polish
But I think we can read and understand like 30% of Serbo-Croatian
Czech
That of course, because we used to be a part of the same country and we (at least in Slovakia) still watch a lot of movies/TV shows and whatnot in Czech if Slovak dub/sub isn't available
Polish is also kinda understandable if spoken slowly(haha) or written, and maybe Bulgarian, but for example russian is way too different for me, I legit wouldn't catch anything at all unless the person really went out of their way to be clear and slow D;
i understand czech and polish, if i knew cyrilic alphabet i would maybe figure out something also from other slavic languages, and personally i understand bit of spanish because i used to watch tons of football in it and i can guess many things thanks to context and assimilation with other languages, but i never actually learnt it
I can undersand russian even tho my only experience with it was learning cyrilics which wasn´t that hard I can´t understand people when they speak (except for some random words) but when I see something written in russian I can understand it 90% of the times
>and maybe Bulgarian
I highly doubt so :) I had Bulgarian colleague and I hardly understood a word
Been to Bulgaria every summer since I was like 7, so maybe that's why, but I'm pretty sure I could get by somehow :D
You're right though, it is a quite different language D;
Teaching young boys to ceremoniously whip women and splash water at them every easter
You usually phase out of it as an adult man nowadays, thinking how horrible it is, yet you refuse to not pass on the experience to the kids
Well i would say pirohy or šišky
¹ pirohy -> they are made in most cases from potato dough,  filling depends on region (it can be jam , cottage cheese or sort of things like meat , vegetables , blue cheese etc
² šišky -> these are made from sourdough
Again , filling depends on region
It can be filled with jam , raw vegetables / fruit, chocolate,  various creams etc
Párek v rohlíku
Just a wiener in rohlík.
Fries, langos, placky (grated potato pancakes) laska (potato pancakes ) and cigánská oecienka (it's not racist and it is just a chicken or pig meat between a bun like bread ish thing, but a lot harder and also onions and mustard )
Slovakia
I think langoš is more applicable (even if it's a hungarian invention)
Yeah, langoš with tartar sauce/sour cream, garlic and grated cheese is perfect
I take it , but imo , fast food is most likely fried on pan or in a deep frier , so , that's why
I would say it's [tank man from 1968]
Came here to post this
Definitely the first photo that comes to most Slovaks' minds when it comes to historical photos
The man was later identified to be Emil Gallo
He took his life 2 years later due to family reasons (years after occupation were turbulent for many families)
His daughter said that she found out about this the next day when the photo of her father was published
He never really talked about it with them tho
However, a 17 years old girl was killed by soviet occupants at those places
Regarding photographer Ladislav Bielik - the world didn't really know who made the picture as it was distributed anonymously
However, the regime knew
He was forced to leave his job and he was assigned work in less prestigious positions during normalization which followed after the soviet occupation of Czechoslovakia
He died in 1984
He was finally internationally recognized as the author of the picture after the fall of communist regime
More on the story in [this article]
Absurd bitching about everything that exists/existed, happened, didnt happen, is supose to happen, or is not supose to happen
Homophobia (pretending to be straight is *fun*...) and significantly lower quality of distance education compared to regular education along with lack of helpful info and communication when it comes to applying to universities
Basically same here 20 € for 4 GB, but considering our wages, it's even worst probably
Even if anything is good, many people bitch about it not happening sooner
We are World Champions in complaining and cynicism
Just wait until you actually are in University
Does not get much better
You could get 4ka, which has unlimited data and calls for 20 euros
though the reception isn't as good as the big threes
I certainly don't doubt that lol, but some of the stuff I had to call them for could have been easily posted on their website
But hey, if they want plenty of confused students to call them with the same questions all day, who am I to judge ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Ugh, do you mean Slovenia
We haven't been in Eurovision since 2012
Not exactly what you asked because it relates to currency, but Czech students often measure their expenses in beers
In Prague a beer is usually 30-40 czk (1
1-1
4€), so a mcdonald menu costs 3 beers, new (cheap) shoes 15-20 beers and so on
In Slovakia we have pokokot and it means from here to that cunt over there
Also it can mean that you have a lot of work (mam pokokot roboty)
Or there were many people ( bolo tam pokokot ľudí )
Outside of the amount of election periods to finish the highway from Bratislava to Košice, I can't think of any
Joo, vittukitaristi purilainen
Same in Slovakia
"Mail" in spoken language may be used more than "e-mail", but still, we don't say "gmail", just when we really mean Gmail
You just need to study Austrian Hungarian empire
But more like
Czech Republic
Hungary
Russia
Germany
Austria
Czechia - We shared most of our history together, like we were one state longer than we were sepparated, and lived thru most of the both wars together
Hungary - the uter hatred towards hungary is felt thru all of our history books, and our constitution
Russia - well iron curtain happened, we were there
Germany - nazi puppet state duh
Somebody put ottoman empire down in comments, so I might put Samo's Empire here, we are pretty proud about that thingy, whilst it lasted
Edit: actually samos empire would be above germany and russia, wery proud about that
whilst it lasted
> We shared most of our history together, like we were one state longer than we were sepparated
I mean we together for a longer time in one entity even with Croatia than Czech lands
> the uter hatred towards hungary is felt thru all of our history books
like current history school books
well, not really
> our constitution
wtf where
> samos empire would be above germany and russia, wery proud about that
whilst it lasted
sorry, but again wtf
regarding early Slavic states there definitely is an obsession with Great Moravia but this alleged pride about Samo's Empire is quite a stretch
No we don't.
It was years ago, so I don’t really know, but from what I remember it was mostly about the territory of Slovakia plus events that affected us significantly like Mohács, Turkish wars, etc
and later we’ve talked about Magyarization and Černová massacre and WW1
We learn mostly about the history in the North, but also about the events affecting whole country (like kings, their policies etc)
So in practice we learn about the Golden Bull, the Battle of Mohács, but then there's focus only on the Turkish wars taking place in the North; we learn about the division of the kingdom, the uprisings, but then it's focused mostly on Royal Hungary
In the 19th century it's mainly about the conflict of Hungarian and Slovak national movements
Also most of the maps presented show only the North with the current borders of Slovakia marked as well, which can be maybe controversial for Hungarians
Like I dunno much about current, I never felt like any books I got in school were very current, and yeah our constitution was pretty much sentence after sentence, first declaring our independence and after that declaring that no other nation can rule over us mainly hungarians, or something like that
I dunno I read it on the internet now, it doesnt look like something I read years ago, since that was even written in older language
I went to school few years ago, might be more PC now, but I remember how hated the hungarians were portrayed in there, like satan himself is down under those boarders
Also yeah Samo´s empire is (was) mentioned more, also I seen it mentioned few times on here to be convinced that Slovak people care about it more than GM, but yeah GM is pretty big talk in our history too
"I mean we together for a longer time in one entity even with Croatia than Czech lands "  - I have no idea what that sentence is suposed to mean
> I went to school few years ago, might be more PC now, but I remember how hated the hungarians were portrayed in there, like satan himself is down under those boarders
It seems your memories about the portrayal of Hungary in the school books mixed with other sources, maybe teachers, politicians, other people
I remember (and looked them up now) the books from the early 2000s and I can't find anything similar to what you're stating
I think it would be fair to acknowledge that the anti-Hungarian sentiment in the 90s and the 00s didn't have much to do with the books and the constitution, unless you can explicitly show the examples
> I dunno I read it on the internet now, it doesnt look like something I read years ago, since that was even written in older language
The part you're referring to hasn't changed since 1992 so it could hardly be written in "older language". I still can't find any "utter hate" or mentions of Hungarians
> Also yeah Samo´s empire is (was) mentioned more, also I seen it mentioned few times on here to be convinced that Slovak people care about it more than GM
That's very subjective but ok
> "I mean we together for a longer time in one entity even with Croatia than Czech lands " - I have no idea what that sentence is suposed to mean
I have a typo there, \*we were together
Even if you count the pre-1918 history in the Habsburg Empire (even though there were different policies in the parts we and the Czechs belonged to), 10th century - 16th century of separation is still longer than 16th century - 1993
In addition to that, what is "sharing history" in the early Middle Ages with Czechs is a bit complicated subject
The point I wanted to make is that the "common" history of Slovaks and Czech isn't exceptionally long, considering that we shared longer history with all the nations of Hungarian Kingdom (like Croats) than with Czechs
That doesn't negate all the mutual contacts we've had throughout the history
You cannot rly compare history with czech to that with hungarians, yeah we probably were on par with everybody at some point in time, but the last 150years of empire (maybe more hard to evaluate) we were basicaly slaves in "our" empire
But yeah, maybe hungary is above czechia in the matter of ammount of facts learned in history classes, not against that idea
Also how is my sentence about Samo subjective but yours about Moravia isnt
Aand yeah ... I dont think why else would a kid at elementary school have anti-hungarian ideas other than what is teached, maybe teachers portrayed it in very bad way during lessons about Empire
Dunno but Im preety sure we were portrayed as opressed minority in the books
I mean yeah they dont write in book that HATE HUNGARY/HUNGARY BAD, obviously
> You cannot rly compare history with czech to that with hungarians
The OP's question was: "If someone were to study your whole country's history, about which other 5 countries would they learn the most
", not something like "Which country's history do you have the most positive relations with
> we were basicaly slaves in "our" empire
Maybe if you paid attention in the history class you would be more secure about these parts of the history (and I don't say they are too positive)
You can look it up anytime if you want
I know it sounds super condescending, sorry for that
>Also how is my sentence about Samo subjective but yours about Moravia isnt
Just look at the constitution you mentioned
Or compare the information on these two subjects in the wiki pages
Or in the school books
Monuments, books, places named after GM personalities
I even find the GM stuff quite overblown in today's Slovak culture, we learn much more about it
On the other hand, we know very little about Samo's Empire overall, the connection to modern Slovaks and Slovakia is even much weaker than to GM, which is understandable
> I dont think why else would a kid at elementary school have anti-hungarian ideas other than what is teached, maybe teachers portrayed it in very bad way during lessons about Empire
Dunno but Im preety sure we were portrayed as opressed minority in the books
I mean yeah they dont write in book that HATE HUNGARY/HUNGARY BAD, obviously
Well, if you learn the history very superficially and focus on the worst parts, it definitely does give you a certain view, even though a very blurry one
The rest is then filled with random negative memories and emotions passed from generation to generation, frustrated teachers, hardcore nationalist groups, negative confrontations with the other side (who often also see you just as the biggest evil)
There definitely are many historical facts in the books which can be pretty infuriating to learn, the key is not to become too emotional about them
I know I may have sounded like a dickhead at times, just I mean this uncertain hate is what various people abuse in their favor
I wanted to say it's all about the interpretation of history and sticking to the facts
Old habits die hard but maybe the edu system is really failing as well
Huh, welp I might have got it wrong, maybe it is just a distorted memory on my part, waaaait, [look] what I found ! There ! the old slovak language form I was talkin about, and that is hella anti hungarian in my eye
" The National Council declares that in the name of the Czech-Slovak nation living within the borders of Hungary, only it is entitled to speak and act
The Hungarian government is not entitled to this, which for decades has not known more serious tasks, such as suppressing everything that is Slovak, did not build and allow our nation or a single school, did not allow the Slovak people to get into public administration and offices, destroying our people
and exploited its medieval feudal system and politics
&#x200B;
Pretty "opressed minority / hungary bad" feeling from that text
&#x200B;
But yeah, that aint no constitution, but this is the document I was supporting my claims with
Okay so you've got from a hateful constitution and being slaves for 150 years to a legit historical document of the Declaration from 1918
\- literally stating "the Hungarian government" not "Hungarians bad".
\- written quite dramatically given the times, but describing the real policy of magyarization and the real poor social and cultural conditions of Slovaks in the last DECADES of the Empire, which the declaration naturally reacted to
If you compare it to your initial comment, it's something quite different
>Hungary - the uter hatred towards hungary is felt thru all of our history books, and our constitution
Well yeah, this is the one thing I was refering to in one sentence I said not the whole argument, the rest I dont care enough to research
In 100 years, highway from Bratislava to Košice will still be 4 more years away from being finished
You’re being optimistic
In Slovakia we mostly meme our politicians (or some minor celebrities)
I am afraid it is not interestimg unless you know the news
Also Vihreät kuulat, although that might be just r/suomi
The best one is "drž už piču Erik
Czechia no doubt
I mean do I have to say anything at all :D? We speak almost the same language , have the same traditions and we share now more than 100 years of history
Then after Czechoslovakia was over we had a peaceful "divorce". I sometimes fantasize how would Czechoslovakia look like in the present
The breakup is a big controversy
Anyways relations with Czechia are best than ever
Czechs are for me definitely more than brothers, whenever I am in Czech Republic I feel like as if I am home in Slovakia :)
brothers till hockey starts
Well you were neighbours for a loong time
Sorry for separating you
Till literally anything competitive starts
They are not the same, the grammar is very different
We can understand each other because the vocabulary is pretty similar and because of mutual exposure
That is why we do not understand polish that easy because their vocab is much different and grammar as well - but still it is very easy to learn if we are exposed to it
The difference is more distinct
While most of our words do sound the same, there are far to many spelling differences
The english language differences are more like accents
Czech and Slovak are clearly two different languages, just very similar
Hey we don't need you
We have Czechs
I will be frank, never have I not been able to tell right away
I do enjoy the border bluriness though
Český a Slovenský jazyk su vzájomne rozumiteľné

(Slovakia) I'd make it the rainbow LGBTQ flag - I'm not even gay, I'd just love to mess with the bigots and homophobes that make up a large portion of the population here
Without the crown though
Having a crown there would imply monarchy
Exactly like that but I would put furries in there
Just to make it worse
Why would you remove it
It's not complex at all, just three hills and double cross
Most western people can't really distinguish Slovak from Czech, Russian or most slavic languages
But I have also heard that Slovak is kind of a "Slavic Esperanto" because most slavic people can understand it clearly without knowing it
i really don't know what people think of my language, others tell me how would you describe slovak language ?
People usually say that Slovak sounds like Russian
Some people have also told me that it sounds like I’m upset when I speak Slovak
Czechs in general like Slovak language, they think it is softer than Czech and melodic and Czech men think it's sexy when Slovak woman is speaking it
Polish people think Slovak sounds funny and childish (curiously, Slovaks think the same about Polish language)
Non-Slavic people usually think it's Russian
a lot of slovaks describe german as "the sound of a chainsaw"
it really sounds like spanish, but with difference that i understand no words
ah, pich accent, he will do lot of problems during time i will learn swedish xD
for people from Slovakia both Czech and Polish sound funny lol
I would like to thank to our Czech bros for helping us in newly formed Czechoslovakia by building infrastructure , building schools and gymnasiums and sending their teachers
We wouldn't be where we are now without you guys :)
Germany for being a political role model (though you're fucking it up with AfD lately)
Austria for being a economic and social role model (so we see how to improve ourselves in this regard)
Hungary for being a cautionary tale (in politics) and teaching us delicious food
Poland for being bros (every Pole I've met during my travels was a total coolio)
Ukraine for showing us shit could be a lot worse :)
Czechs for
well
everything I guess
US for NATO and taking in our countrymen during periods of strife, also cherry pepsi, love that shit
Russia for
uhm
eeerh
yea
ushankas are cizy in winter I guess
I'll go with both to our brothers Czechs
Thank you for educating our ancestors during the monarchy, some of our greatest Slovaks studied in Czechia/Moravia
Thank you for electing communists after WW2, those 40 years were enjoyable
How is your Czech wife
Nicely kept public places, functioning services, overall your country side looks nicer than here, people seem to care, general sense of "ordnung", better roads, newer trains, bigger cities have great public transport schemes
Austrians look overall more caring about their environment than us, more woke
"You cross the border to Austria, X actually works unlike the PoS X in here
We want to live in a country like that and a lot of people look up to you with regards to all this
S-senpai
No one is Russophobe
Just cause we hate what Putin and his cronies are doing doesn't mean we hate all Russians
Same propaganda shit is in China, oh the west hates what CCP is doing, they racist abd hate all Chinese, it's racism guys, not disagreement with glorious Chinese government
The fuckhuge Russia propaganda machine has its tentacles all over Europe
UKIP was financed by them undirectly, lots of eurosceptic groups here have ties to Kremlin as well
It's kinda hard being indifferent towards a country radicalusing a bombarding your citizens with fake news oropaganda, translated word for word from Russian
Nice whataboutism
One party doing x does not excuse and normalise other party doing x. Both are wrong and the US gets a lot of shit for its bullshit
Doesn't excuse Russia just yoinking a part of neighbor's sovereign land though
If they fear being attacked by NATO why don't they join
We joined cause we were afraid of Russia
Oh, they don't join cause then they can't invade whoever they want
Aaaah ok
Yes we do, but its old door so it's not much for security purposes as it is for "stay closed pls" purposes
Our plot is fenced and the entrance door does not have a handle from neither side
The house itself is not locked
Never, even when nobody is home
The house front door has also no handle on the outside, but the terrace doors can be easily opened from the outside
Am i afraid that somebody comes at night and tries something stupid
Nobody in his right mind would do that, knowing my temper and size
Am i afraid that somebody robs us while we are not at home
There is nothing really valuable inside and all computers use FDE
You have sneaky car
Just keep tank at half so it won't sneak into another state
And if you for some reason forget when you're in a hurry
"*Džon mejd his vej tu a tavern thrú d dark forist, ounly tu fajnd aut det hí forgot d many*".
Minus the corona, our head of the government was in a serious car crash
He has again had become a butt of the jokes because in the car with him, in a state car, was a suspiciously playmate looking ex miss
Probably mommy number 11
And we put one of the corrupted judges in the jail
So the corruption saga continues
While one goes to jail, the other keeps enjoying state money for his orgies with women
I seriously don't get how can people vote for Boris Kollar
He is the epitome of mafia and corruption
Oh you are still hearing about it in Belgium
Good, I think here it was swallowed by our corona news
But people were outraged when it came out
Good that his wife's dared to expose them, that was very brave of her
He is head of parliament, bot government, but I agree with you
Yeah, to be fair I didn't know how to translate his title in that moment
Masaryk University in Brno
That or Charles's University in Prague
And no, I'm not joking
However, Charles' MFF is still the best in teaching math, physics or (theoretical) computer science
From what I've seen, čvut is still a lot behind on these, although the nuclear faculty's physics department is very solid
I guess my own country is quite underwhelming from a tourist perspective, partly because all neighbouring countries eclipse us in anything we can offer to a tourist
The Alps are bigger than Tatras, Hungarian spa have already gained world recognition (unlike Bardejov, Dudince or Piešťany), beer and drinking/partying tourism is more developed in Czechia, Germany has larger and more beautiful castles (yes, I know they're not neighbours, but whatever), Poles have more infamous concentration camps
Anyway, my top pick is North Macedonia
They have even not managed to achieve infamy, like Moldova for being objectively the poorest or Albania for their human and drug trafficking
North Macedonia for me is just a perfectly blank page
I think all of europe is interesting and worthy of beeing around Slovakia
But trust me, people from uninteresting countries, all you have to do, is become Slovakia to be interesting again
Two interesting things about Moldova are, that there is both the largest and the second largest wine cellar in the world located in the country, near the capital
They are so huge that visitors have to be transported by cars inside
And they have some good wine stored there
Even Vladimir Putin celebrated his 50th birthday there
The second interesting thing I observe is the resemblance of the country's president [Igor Dodon] with the Looney Tunes character Elmer Fudd
Rude
True, but rude
The most interesting things are way back in history or it’s just common Slavic stereotypes we all share
Hahaha that subforum
Great to find out that not only Australia does not exist
That is kindaa an ignorant view
I feel like people believe that 30 years we spend as an allied country to soviets would somehow erase all the thousands of years of history before
The only history we have with Russians now is WW2 memorabilia and yet that is still more connected to national resistance fighters
Majority of out traditions are not in any way connected to Russians
They are connected mostly to Austrian Hungarian empire, then to our ehm fight with Austrian Hungarian empire, you know the place we spend hundreds of years with
It would be like only connecting Germany to nazis
Do people not learn history or what
I assure you Slovakia also has tourist traps to offer but again, they are eclipsed by the Ukrainian
Besides Bratislava, there are the Tatra moutains, various castles/castle ruins (Spiš castle is listed on the UNESCO world heritage list), folk architecture (Čičmany, Bardejov, Levoča), the spa I mentioned, some caves (which, again, is a thing that Slovenia has larger and better promoted worldwide) and that's pretty much it
I've been to Tallinn for one day, BTW, and that's pretty much everything I know about Estonia
What would you pick
Czechs got it as well
Kecskemét has always reminded me of "Kočkomet", which would be a "cat-thrower" in Czech ;)
Also, hello from Nyitra
Also, I used to have a username Sir d'Emental or Sir de Mental  in online games
Czechs have Becherovka, which has been manufactured since the 19th century
Hungarian Unicum can be traced back to 1790
Polish Zubrowka was created probably in the evening of the 6th day (judging by the claim God had to rest on the 7th)
TatraTea is only a very recent brand and I feel it still needs some time to gain more recognition worldwide
Sami ste si ho zvolili, nesťažujte sa
Fun fact: Capital city Bratislava is third greenest capital city in the world
Give that man a slice of Karabakh
>varied architecture
the unifying hallmark are bullet holes
The names are Milestii Mici (the largest, visitors get to drive their own car inside) and Cricova (the one with Putin; tourists are driven by road trains)
You also have Toruń, Krakow, Wroclaw, Poznań, Gdansk -all are beautiful cities- Wieliczka, Licheń Stary cathedral and Malbork castle
I just wanted to point out indirectly that we, too, have a history of holocaust to offer to dark tourists
But I don't see your lakes as an advantage, unless you get rid of all mosquitos in the region :(
I wonder where that’s from, considering we’ve got a oil refinery not even that far away from the main parts
I like history, so I kinda learn on my own, but we generally covered Europe quite well in the gymnasium
So that helped
Maybe it was the type of the school too
But i don't doubt it, as there wasn't really Slovakia before
It was Czechoslovakia and before that Austrian Hungarian empire and before that Samo land
And before than we had some celts I think
And some cave dudes
Generally the history of a small new country is hidden within the other countries history, similar with Balcan countries or Baltics
So for example in WW1 slovakians were forced to fight for Austrian Hungarian empire, even if all we wanted was to join the independence movements
And some did I think
Defected the army
But that war worked out quite nice for us
Moravian empire was good times
Everything after that to 1918 is meh
Obviously I simplified
Google search "Sir Parmesan Karl May" returns nothing substantial
are you sure a German writer was making puns in slavic languages
Strange that he did not name Latvia, because out of the three of you, they are the ones I think about the least
They are like emergency backup Lithuania
Now that you've shut down Ignalina, I don't know why do they still exist
Its from 2018
And it was by metres per kilometer with trees
Bratislava has very much parks and forests
Koliba, Pečniansky les, Lesopark, Horský park etc
That’s true
At least we’ve got something going for us
Though in recent Slovak news I’ve read we have scary high pollution numbers in the air
>Tito
Thats nice but we didnt have him
We had a nazi called Tiso
And as you recall WW2 had a genocide
Slovakia was  nazi state so yes, the regime commited genocide
But you are aware "sir" (or "syr") means cheese in all slavic language, right
V-E-R-Y corrupt
Ours parliament is separated to three groups
Group A is trying to steal as much they can by appealing to elder population
Group B is trying to stop Group A from stealing by appealing to older adults, but since the elders are voting more they can't succeed
Group C are fascists
Like, literal extremists that are using the chaos and hate to win some votes by appealing to young people
Basically mix of Hitler, Mussolini and Tiso
Group A and C are racing for votes while Group B is just trying to survive
At least this is how I understand our current politics
Slovakia, btw
Wow, where to begin
Helping Vietnam abduct a person using our government plane, giving 300M€ for education and research to companies that existed only a few days and made 0€ so far, the crystal clear connections to the Slovak and Italian mafia, claiming the massive deforestation in geometric shapes and export of trees is happening because of climate change then claiming it's still forest even when it's all cut down, the almost literal bootlicking of our speaker of the parliament to Russia and Putin
I think you now have a brief idea
Not much tho , there were some cases during '00
Depends on what should we protest against first
Older slovaks - those born during Communism - are too lazy to actually demand something
We are actually protesting a lot, but there's too much things
Also group A is full of smart lawyers that know how to fuck up the system right, so we can't really do anything other than radical things
Last time we protested against our (now) ex-prime minister he quit so he would not suffer consequences and our new prime minister is just his pawn
(They are in the same party) Then there are the extremists
The problem with those is that they are not doing anything - yet
They are strongly against gypsies (gypsies are actually scared of them) and since gypsies are huge problem in our country white people are with the extremists
The leader of that group - Marián Kotleba - is just pure dictator material
He was imprisoned when younger for extremism, but somehow people still vote for him
The worst problem with them is that they want to sort of cut ties with EU and cooperate with Russia more, but since even Russia criticize him, they won't cooperate, leading our country to be alone for the first time (excluding V4)
Now that I think of it our politics are fucked
We are state with great police services, but since they are under government, which is kind of like mafia, it's useless on high level
I'll probably move out when I grow up
That is 100% the same situation, perfectly described
Hopefully it will be better in Romania, for us in Slovakia it's really hard now, we will have elections in a month and the govenment parties have a decline but a lot of the votes for them moved to the neonazis (actualy neonazis, I don't use such terms lightly) who have no programme at all, are grossly incompetent and lazy as hell (based on their parliamentary activities throughout the last 4 years)
[This song] came out only few months ago but it had awesome reviews and I personaly really like it
Tallinn-Helsinki undersea tunnel, Fehmarn Belt fixed link, Messina bridge, Adriatic-Ioannic highway
Highway connecting Bratislava and Košice of course
It's being built since 1972 and it's still maybe 65 % only done ?
Highway to China
And China will pay for it
Can you imagine that road trip
Ever realized that Madrid, Toulouse, Lyon, Geneva, Bern, Zurich, Prague, Wroclaw, Lodz, Warsaw, Minsk, Smolensk and Moscow are all located on the same line (or at least their suburbs)
I see it as the backbone
It's funny how we can't build one simple highway, but we sure as hell can build another bridge across the Danube, or a dam, or anything else that isn't a highway to Kosice because of "problematic terrain". Switzerland has a problematic terrain yet they have several highways
Honestly it is sad, construction started before my mother has been born
I think it was one orb to years ago that there was literally built less distance of that highway than snail can move per year
It is not exactly collinear
Faro is, though
Maybe it would comfort them that there is no German city on the route at all
In reality, the largest happened to be Ingolstadt, but I don't find it significant enough to stop there
Of course, if the train could zig-zag a little, Munich would be included, maybe also Zaragoza and Bialystok
Nice one
I also found Amsterdam-Düsseldorf-Frankfurt-Munich and Hamburg-Berlin-Wroclaw-Krakow
Not really, only the Pyrenees
It dodges both the Alps and the Carpathians
Yes
Yes
Totally
I freaking love trains
I love them as a kid because it eas the only place I wasnt sick and still do
Its so nice and comfy
You just chill, look at the countryside,can read, have space to walk, can go to a restaurant, even have someone going around with food
Even can sleep there
High speed train network is my ultimate goal for EU
With or without Olivenza
I am sorry, but no matter how how I try, I can't fit Milan, Basel and Luxemburg onto the first line and Bucharest and Varna are also way off on the second
I agree that EU has build quite satisfactory system of not entirely straight railways, I'm here only for the compulsive mental masturbation
Oh surely, just because it's biscuit sized, shaped and is eaten like a biscuit means nothing since it doesn't crunch
By that logic a fucking crisp is a biscuit isn't IS THAT WHAT YOIU WANT CHAOS AND ANARCHY
I'M SURROUNDED BY MAD MEN, MAD MEN I SAY
> Another debate is wether those small breads are called
Kaiserka/kaizerka
Henceforth, I shall call my toiler a "serník".
Not many tourists know we exists, so our national parks and nature is clean and silent, as it should be
“Medvedík čistotný” for us, something along “clean little bear”
Noooo
I love that song
I randomly discovered it while searching for German songs
It's just an unapologetic bop, best for summer parties
and then pewdiepie came and made that song popular everywhere
Such a good song
It played during my graduation party
It's simple, but there probably isn't a party in Slovakia that doesn't play this song at least once
EGO really struck gold with it
As a non russian I know only two contemporary russian groups
Leningrad and Little Big
Is  not popular in Russia
Give it a few years
Don't you remember switching the radio with those songs too
Nah, that's just an example of a typical Slovak gangster/rapper/douche looking dude
We have tonnes of these guys in the country
Wow, holy shit
Some people are, luckily not most of them
But I know that one person bought 100 KILOS of flour in our small local grocery store, so there's that
Also, it's been harder to find oil, flour, pasta, and bottled water in certain shops, since some paranoid folks have been panic buying in bulk
excuse me but between me and my bf it's him using a shit ton of tp, so yeah but also no
I mean I understand stockpiling canned food and shit, since going outside will be prohibited and you are scared you will starve (still ridiculously overblown, but at least some sense is there)
But toiletpaper
If shit hits the fan (heh), imma just wash my ass, whats the big deal
It's like buying 1000 condoms, yes if quarantine hits we gon be fuckin to pass the time but are condoms so essential to survival
Whelp
I think I finally found my word
I always had this feeling in my life
Ignác, Bonifác, pretty much everything ending on ác. Fucking awful
>Horst, Herbert, Jürgen
Are these names really frowned upon
As a german-speaking Slovak, I find them quite likeable
I feel like you're excluding a certain part of your history and ultimately Germany itself
Small things like names
Dynamo, Photographic objective, helicopter, damn I'm surprised how many cool stuff was invented by people of Slovak origin
Parachute by Štefan Banič. He immigrated to USA but he was born in Slovakia (Austria-Hungary in that time)
And both his parents were also Slovak
Driving laws
Different countries have different max speeds, different allowed blood alcohol content, different mandatory lights on laws
In some countries you have to stop before a pedestrian crossing if you see a pedestrian waiting there, in others you don’t.
It would be best if you could just pay for public transport with your regular Credit Card
It’s already possible in some places (e.g. London)
This can be triple the fun in central europe because
- the national rail operators (ZSSK, CD, MAV, PKP, DB, OBB, ...) work together and re-sell each other’s tickets but the commercial ones do not
- the prices differ when you buy a ticket online and at a station
And when you travel to a different country each country’s operator has its own prices again (which can again differ online and at a station)
So e.g. Bratislava - Praha can have at least 5 different ticket prices (because you can also buy return ticket at a station which has again a different price)
- When combined this can be even more fun because you can also buy a czech ticket online at the czech site for a trip that takes place entirely in Slovakia
And it can sometimes be cheaper than buying locally (it usually doesn’t happen though, but can and does still happen sometimes)
You can buy tickets from Bratislava to Breclav and then from Breclav to Warsaw on CD
cz and it should work
Older people in Slovakia don’t speak/understand English
In bigger stations we have specialized counters for “International routes” where they speak English
We also have “Customer centers” (often hidden in a corner of a station or behind one) where you can buy tickets as well and they speak English too
When I was in London all I did was tap my iPhone and it worked in buses, metro and trains
It calculates the best ticket prices for you and only actually charges you at the end of the day
There is a daily and a weekly cap equivalent to a daily/weekly paper ticket
I don’t know if you can buy a monthly ticket on your CC but you can get a contactless “oyster” card for that and I believe contactless is a better technology than magnetic cards (magnetic cards can be demagnetized and then they need to be repaired
There are some ATMs which check for the card’s origin country and request a fee if the card’s not local
(Mainly the Euronet network seen in multiple countries but some local ones as well (seen in some local banks in HU and CZ))
Also DCC is still offered sometimes even if you use Revolut
I got DCC questions sometimes even if I’m using non-Revolut EUR card in another EUR paying country
Revolut only helps with currency conversion fees and bank fees (and even then has a fee if you need to withdraw more than 200eur monthly)
Visa/Mastercard/whatever
on each card the first 4, 6 or 8 numbers identify issuing bank and country
You can try it for yourself on
I have 3 cards that don’t charge fees for withdrawing abroad including N26 and Revolut, all of them have euro as base currency
The thing is it’s not only the bank which can charge a fee but also the ATM
(The fee is displayed before you actually get to withdraw if applicable)
bring back latin
Weeeell, aaaactually, most of the original devs of Beat Saber are Slovaks so
But the rest are awesome
Yeah, if I recall correctly the devs are Slovaks who were studying in Brno and most of the original music was made by a Czech guy
One Czech journalist tried what would happen with water in -15 degrees C.
The water froze
oh germany
Dont know about this particular case, but last year we pretty much deported 7 russian diplomats for such behaviour - for spreading propaganda and financing "alternative media" and local individuals involved, and a for managing fake companies to avoid russian ban for exports
Could be helpful during this coronacrisis if there is going to be yogurt shortage
>People lost their shit
i do not doubt for a second that many shits have been lost
Reminds me of [Japanese scientists who made steak out of the poop
Thanks Austria for shops near border (Kittsee, Hainburg n/der Donau etc
) We Slovaks likes your shops because of quality
Well, the actions of the Entente after the war were the main reason why WWII was even possible
How to annoy your neighbour 101
after you fucked them up pretty badly too, right
Same in Slovakia, we drink Kofola way more than Coca Cola or Pepsi
English
Or original
I have to have everything in original for some reason
Depends
Most often in English, but there are times, when the dub is pretty good and enhances the experience
Like, I would not want to play Warcraft 3 without the Czech dub, it's just too good and iconic
Or Mafia 1/2, but those are Czech made, of course, so it makes sense
Never
I basically only play Dota 2 and it has a Czech language option, but categorisation is very important in dota
A silence and a mute is not the same and things like that
Yeah I feel like it’s the same way in Slovakia
We don’t have many cities but a lot of people in the capital and in a couple few bigger cities often think of people living in villages as simple, stupid or conservative
It’s obviously not always true but when you look at any election results and see which part of the country voted for which party, it kind of just confirms it
I think this works for most of EU
Citydwellers see them as hillbillies and vice versa, though plenty of rural people travel to Capital for work and most of the people from Capital travel to county for weekends
Is it's just friendly picking on each other
Yep
Two languages is like nothing nothing
I need to do better
I am learning french for now and wanna add Spanish later, so I won't confuse them much
Then need to pick up something non European as Japanese or Swahlili
I love milk
[It sharpens you up and makes you ready for a bit of the old ultra-violence]
We have more:

"V riti" - Up an arse

Do you know if you invoked Tunguzija before 1908
Aj to, aj kukátko
[Tuto] sa môžeš zasvätiť do základov slovenského punku
You must be the other end
Yes, but in 1908 it was rather famously hit by an asteroid
I mean, maybe they invoked it even before the asteroid, merely because how remote it was
Its not prohibited to leave (just to enter for any non-resident), but anyone returning from abroad is required to quarantine at home-isolation for 14 days, otherwise 2000 EUR fine will be issued
Our medical system has been systematically robbed and words "on verge of collapse" have been used more than once well before coronavirus
The strict measures taken by general hygienist are due to that knowlegde
If pandemic erups, system won't cope, no chance of that
And do you know why does US have so many skyscrapers
Because your cities were planned long after the cities of Europe
My city became city in 1255, but it was probably started a lot sooner, so then the population was really just a few people and more complex planning wasn’t a thing back then
Cities which do have skyscrapers are those which were bombarded in the WWII because they had to rebuild basically from scratch and technology was able to produce skyscrapers
But it is more problem of space, because first cities in Europe was builded on mud and it was more organicly organized, while US bulided on more solid roads, with grid roads and later highways in mind
European cities also centered around castles and so that is something US never had to consider in it’s planning
I would accept banning buildings over 250m... in Budapest there was a ban over 100m until recently
in Bratislava it depends on the neighborhood, some neighborhoods don’t allow more than 5 stories and I’m not talking about the historic old town now
“Schovaný, neschovaný, idem
” basically “hidden or not, I’m coming
Aki bújt aki nem megyek, at least for hide and seek
Wow, you guys have the same word (lopata) for shovel
never realised that, it’s fascinating
Well, it comes as no surprise to me, it’s probably the common history
Pravdupovediac ani nie, ale myslím si, že to každé dieťa pozná z televízie a občas sa môže stať, že to použijú namiesto tej verzie, ktorú som písal vyššie
Ono tým, že značné množstvo detských rozprávok pozerajú preložených v češtine (keďže slovenský ekvivalent neexistuje) sa môže stať, že začnú používať niektoré výrazy z češtiny bez toho aby si to vôbec uvedomovali
Na čom, samozrejme, nie je nič zlé, keďže naše jazyky sú si také podobné a značné množstvo našej populácie používa takzvané bohemizmy úplne prirodzene, len skrátka nie sú spisovné podľa našich slovníkov

Why some austrians going to shopping to Slovakia trash things
From my own experience, because it's cheap and students love to mix it in large quantities of juice
Terrible hangover though
Thankfully palinka is much more widespread in the south
It's really better  especially the homemade stuff
Yes, I always see very much austrian cars with sign Burgenland or Wien in front of Tesco and then going out from shop with cheap and trash food what novody buying
I dont understand this
Many actually, especially for food products like Nutella (chocolate/nuts cream), Salko (condensed milk), horalky (typical slovak bisccuit/candy), cif (cleaning for your sink), Jar/pur (this soap for cleaning dishes), granko (chocolate granules), inka(coffe like drink - like nestle caró)
just off the top of my head
>And almost all of us call a hairdryer "Fön"
It is literally the official word used here "Fén" for hairdryer
In Slovak it’s also the same but we borrowed it not from Slavic, but Hungarian (at least that’s what I got from the fact Hungarian have the same words)
It’s šarkan - in Hungary sárkány
In Slovák, it’s the same we have two words for a dragon - “drak ” and “ šarkan” both of which can signify a dragon or a kite
It seems we stole "šarkan" from you and use it almost interchangibly with "drak" for both dragons and kites
"Šarkan" usually stands for dragon in older literature, folk fairy tales, while "drak" is more contemporary and comprehensive
I somehow never seen a stupid or disrespectful tourist, all those i met were curious and decent
Maybe just me not actually visiting tourist spots often i dunno
I must say I'm guilty of taking pictures at cemeteries
They are interesting in some strange way
It's usually just a picture of an interesting gravestone tho
One instance we actually took a picture with a gravestone was when we found our family name on a cemetery in Barcelona which was quite unexpected discovery
In Bratislava, capital of Slovakia we use the term CéPéčkari  which is based on a popular website cp
sk, this website shows Public Transport schedules(Cestovné Poriadky)
It is believed that every true CéPéčkar uses this website to get to the capital because they are too poor to own a car
Another meaning is an older one, called Cez Poľný, meaning Over the field
Implying that people have to get through the fields in order to reach the capital city
Touting them as farmers, villagers etc
Same here, but instead of vidlák we have "sedlák". It's used mostly by Bratislava people, and it's even in their dialect
Like, when you use the standard form "sedliak" it just means a farmer
But if you use the Bratislava dialect "sedlák"  it has the implicit derogatory meaning of redneck or someone who doesn't live in the "big city".
(As if Bratislava wasn't just a village compared to rest of Europe)
> It's december 28
What a weird way to celebrate my birthday
From I noticed here, majority of the Europeans(including) prefer jeans and t-shirt, if we talk about outdoors/work/school
If you live in border region (like me in Bratislava), it's very common
My gf lives in Hungary, my mother in Austria, me in Slovakia, and yet we are all only 15-20 minutes by car from each other
It's also extremly common for Slovaks to live in border villages in Austria or Hungary (cheap housing) and commute across border to Bratislava to work or school
Many people also live in Bratislava and commute to Vienna in Austria for work
Also really common among people here is to go grocery shopping to Austria, or for Austrians to go shopping to Bratislava in sunday (shops are closed on sunday in Austria, but open here)
In terms of people moving around, you can easily compare EU countries to US states
Sometimes you may not even notice that you entered different country (well but now things are more complicated thanks to covid)
As a guy living relatively close to the borders (\~10 kilometers) of Czechia and Slovakia, I sometimes cross the border on my bike without even realizing
Since you should carry your ID even if you're in your own home country, it really feels just like traveling from one region of Slovakia to another)
Apart from slight difference in language and the fact we've got Euro and Czechs still hold onto their silly currency, using it to squeeze some extra cash out other Europeans at any opportunity\*, it really isn't any kind of a big deal
&#x200B;
\*For example, you'd like to park at the parking near some Zoo - if you pay in Czech crowns, you pay 90 crowns
If you par in Euro, you pay 4 euro (\~105 crowns)
Currency exchange is also a hassle - If you find yourself in Prague near Florenc and need to get on the last tube, you can bet you're gonna have bad time if you don't have enough Czech cash on you
The card terminal on the ticket machine often doesn't work (or plain isn't there) and the only currency exhanges nearby are run by Russians, who'll give you a paper to sign with incredibly unfair (and possibly illegal) conditions - such as paying over 5 euro just for the privilege of exchanging
Sorry, I'm bitter
Eastern Slovak dialect is influenced by both German and Hungarian
to iron clother - bigľovať - from German "bügeln"
city - varoš - from Hungarian "város"
hat - kalap - from Hungarian "kalap"
breakfast - frištik - from German "Frühstück"
There's a lot more German in Slovak, that you'd never think are loanwords because they are just so very basic
Cibuľa (Zwiebel), cieľ (Ziel), kritizovať (kritizieren), plech (Blech), žemľa (Semmel), etc
It's Czech
Virtually everyone can understand it and I'd say 75% of the population could hold a conversation on any topic
The 25 % is the youngest generation, although they watch Czech cartoons too, I am certain
What does the question mean
Does it include minorities, or we talk foreign language
If minorities, hungarian than gypsy, if foreign, then most likely german
Czech, it’s so similar even a toddler in Slovakia can speak Czech
How many serbians live in switzerland
I wouldn't be so sure about it
Yes, almost all Slovaks claim to speak it, but I dare to say not even 50% would be able to speak a few sentences without mistakes
(I myself when not sure about a Czech word use a Slovak word with ř or some Czech sounding noise in it
Considering there is cca
a half million of Hungarians, Hungarian would be the country's most spoken second language, when excluding English
I was considering German for a moment, but I'm not sure if there are enough speakers to outweigh the Hungarians, even though there is a high no
of German companies present
Even 50% is more than half a million Hungarian speakers
Also, I've never said anything about being fluent or perfect in Czech but I am certain that if we consider the overall level of literacy, Czech is the 2nd  most known/spoken language in Slovakia
When it comes to German, you're way off
I work for a German Automotive company in Bratislava and only the top management speak German, the middle management I'd say 50% and workers close to 0 %.
P.s.: I appreciate your input but I'd like for you to substantiate your thought next time
I think majority of people would have no problem actually speaking Czech
We would sound like idiots, yes, but we could do it, if we wanted to
>Even 50% is more than half a million Hungarian speakers
Yes
>...Czech is the 2nd most known/spoken language in Slovakia
I mean, point taken, it's just that mutually intelligibility shouldn't be counted as knowing the other language, but have it your way
>When it comes to German, you're way off
Well, you might be surprised - [click] - [click] I live in a region with a high German proficiency, your anecdotal evidence doesn't mean it can't be true
Very popular
It will die down tho once they legalize it
Sounds like Slovakia
No, but I plan on moving to Czechia for at least a few years, maybe even stay
It's not like we're different countries culturally, and I kinda don't care about politics, so I don't even count it to "leaving" my country
Thats why I like being an EU citizen
I can go to live anywhere I want without giving a reason or getting some “points” like in australia
Well technically majority of our politicians were born in a different country
Unless we fill it with under 30 year olds
I dont know why, but i really love the French for that
Where are my Czech brothers
I have no idea who started it
Mostly jokes based on stereotypes, stealing, cheating on ones wife and politics (but that one is synonymous to stealing)
The best kind of humour
Has any politician in Your country suffered a nervous breakdown during live broadcast
This pretty much made headlines today in Slovakia
Our prime minister Igor Matovič was roasted for half an hour by a radio talk show host, towards whom the PM was remarkably submissive, and in the end the host announced him, that one of the PM's political partners, the minister of economy Richard Sulík, had once again overtly defied his strategy to fight the pandemics, to which the PM reacted in live broadcast not too unlike Hitler in the famous scene from Der Untergang, first ranting against Sulík and demanding his demission, then breaking down and almost crying, powerlessly
There are recordings of the broadcast available online, although only in Slovak, which is maybe good, because I really felt sorry for the PM, as I admire his genuine dedication to the fight against the pandemics, which is something that shouldn't be mocked in any case, but I wonder if any such thing has ever happened elsewhere, because I don't remember a similar scene in the history of my country's politics and I wonder how special it really is
I am kind of sorry for him, for the situation in which he took over the country
I mean, imagine that you get a job as bus driver
You go for your first shift, and you receive bus that has no brakes, uncontrollable engine and is on fire
Of course, there was also [Vladimír I-will-punch-the-f\*\*k-out-of-you Mečiar] but I consider it a different kind of breakdown
Honestly I don’t blame him, he’s just a human after all, and opposition is giving him a hard fight, as most of their friends are getting jailed due to their corruption scandals, which should have been done years ago
Not only that, but also some of the coalition members are undermining him constantly
That being said, I agree that he should be more diplomatic when presenting stuff and try to avoid saying certain things in public before having consulted them in private
I saw the headline and immediately recognized the country haha
I am sorry for him too
When you look at the numbers, you can tell the plan with rapid antigen testing might have just worked, had it been performed at least on a monthly basis and compulsory
And then you arbitrarily flail with the steering wheel and get angry at passengers pointing out that you just set the course off a cliff
Yes, the situation is hard
But let's not pretend that he is doing anything remotely competent
Even his "great success" in the mass testing was succesful *despite* him not *because of* him
Putting up with Putin is certainly not for teetotallers
Finally, a politician who wasn't afraid to address the elephant in the room
^Don't ^worry, ^I'll ^show ^myself ^out
Something tells me this is going to happen also with Matovič very soon
I've seen public toilet attendants less frustrated with their job
> crazy chicken, hell midget, rabid bitch, cattle with shoes, vomited crow
[...Babylonian scullion, Macedonian wheelwright, brewer of Jerusalem, goat-fucker of Alexandria, swineherd of Greater and Lesser Egypt, pig of Armenia, Podolian thief, catamite of Tartary, hangman of Kamyanets and fool of all the world and underworld, an idiot before God, grandson of the Serpent, and the crick in our dick
Pig's snout, mare's arse, slaughterhouse cur, unchristened brow
Thank you, did you mean red onion or white onion
[Here] the part when the radio host reads the PM a fresh announcement made by Sulík, that he won't speed up the process of purchase of rapid antigen tests, as requested
The PM then goes on, blames Sulík publically for about 5 minutes, requests him to resign, and until the rest of the interview, you can hear in his voice, that he is about to weep (more than usually)
Towards the end of the interview, he implies he himself is considering resignation
It was only a radio talk show, so the PM does not appear on screen
Thank You, I find Italy strangely underrepresented in the comments
Surely, you must have seen so many scenes like this with your politicians on your TV, that it's hard to recall a specific one
Nice
Very nice indeed
I swear I have heard the name before but only now I know, why is it so sound
I'm afraid You won't enjoy it very much, as it was only a radio talk show, the PM does not even appear on screen and you can only hear his voice, speaking Slovak
Anyway, [here] the part when the radio host reads the PM a fresh announcement made by Sulík, that he won't speed up the process of purchase of rapid antigen tests, as requested

From 34:00 he delivers a short Christmas speech to the people where he apologizes for ruining everyone's Christmas with lockdown, because of an *idiot* minister, as he puts it
There are some countries that manage well
For example Finland or New Zaeland have been pretty good
NZ example is impossible to use when compared to Europe
Slovakia is not an island somewhere far away where its easy to close the borders down
Finlad is better comparision, yet they just have better hospitals and that's something we miss
Well, I personally don't agree with everything he does, but I understand that in his place I probably wouldn't do better
Many people are angry at him for 'restricting their rights' and the more extreme ones for 'trying to chip them'. The fact that Matovič doesn't speak like a politician (calmly and composedly) plus uses stupid facebook post to announce vital information doesn't help
He had beef with Sulík (for about 2 months I guess
) because Sulík 'wasn't listening to his orders'. This was the lat drop I guess
Well, it wasn't exactly Bruno Ganz type of breakdown, but I feel the whole interview was very emotional and if you play the last minute, from 34:00, I think you can tell the man sounds was almost crying
By the way, an hour ago it was announced he had been tested positive too
What are you talking about
In the first lockdown they did close the borders completely
Slovakia got no more traffic that NZ
Also, cross-border infections make for a tiny minority of cases
NZ is doing much better internally than Slovakia, which makes the island argument invalid
What are you talking about

Also, cross-border infections make for a tiny minority of cases
NZ is doing much better internally than Slovakia, which makes the island argument invalid
Because NZ can afford to lock itself down
Slovakia cant
We depend on our neighbours too much
The first lock down happened because people were scared of the virus that no one really experienced much here
But we realises unlike NZ we cant keep it for a long time, because we simply have no capacity to
Its much easier to close off an island than a country in the middle of Europe thats has numerous roads and entry points and is part of Shengen
Basically the whole poland orava wedding issue would not be able to happen in NZ because they simply can't cross the water easily to go party to a different country
Therefore being an island helps
Its much easier to contain people inside a country that is locked in by the ocean
Thats why small island countries usually had good covid numbers
So if you want to compare NZ to some countries in Europe, choose Cyprus or Malta
our head of parliament - Andrej Danko, and also some other politicans, also few years ago there was joke that eastern slovakia doesn't exist because our prime minister said that
You mean "supreme monarch with virtually unlimited power, to rule the Russian serfs until the heat death of the universe, being a half-cyborg half-demigod, like the emperor of man".
Please use the full title, thank you
Hungarians and Romanians are natural enemies
Like Austrians and Hungarians
Or Yougoslavs and Hungarians
Or Slovaks and Hungarians
Or Hungarians and other Hungarians
Damn Hungarians they ruined Hungary
Your joke reminded me of another
After a hockey match between the USSR and Czechoslovakia, where the latter were victorious, the Czechoslovak ministry of Foreign affairs received the following telegram:
was a good match STOP
you were clearly the better team STOP
looking forward to a rematch STOP
oil STOP
gas STOP
There's this good one I ~~stole~~ borrowed from the movie "Lives of Others"
Erich Honecker (East German communist leader) opens a window in the morning and says: "Good morning Sun
"Good morning Erich", answers the sun
In the afternoon again he opens the window and says "good afternoon Sun", he says
The suns replies again: "Good afternoon Erich"
In the evening the does it again: "Good evening Sun".
Silence
He says again: "Good evening Sun
From a distance he hears a shout: "Go fuck yourself I'm in the west
I follow Visegrad Group politics and then Germany and France
Was interested also in british when brexit was a hot topic but recently i do not care anymore
I like to observe politics of the Union
Union should stand together, more now than ever
Slovak inperialism at it's best
In Slovakia I would say Tribeč hills
A lot of anomalies are happening there and a lot of people went missing in these hills
It is believed to be interwoven with caves under whole complex
There is even book and a movie about it, called [the Rift] One of the better slovak horrors
The It monster would like to have a word
Where is it
I just read something about that and pit it on my to go list of Czech rep
Very popular
Not rare to see 15 year olds drinking
In the parliament:
- OĽanO: no specifically defined political direction, it's an anti-corruption party
Although, most members are conservatives, but you can also find some liberals and ultra conservatives
Members are expected to vote independently based on their believes
Many are very conservative and overly religious
- Sme Rodina: right-wing conservatives, quite populistic
Promise a lot of money (and rental apartments) to people with no specific plans to collect that money for
- SaS: right-wing liberals, pretty much consistent with their supposed ideology, less beaurocracy, a lot of support for economics
- Za Ľudí: basically liberal (center maybe
- Smer - SD: absolute populists, act like left-wing conservatives, but are relatively liberal, absolute populists
Defrauded like 40 billion € (I am not exaggerating)
- Hlas - SD: Smer - SD, but on a power trip
- Kotleba - ĽSNS: literal nazis, antisemitic speeches in the parliament, protests when the president gave awards to Jewish people (only criticism regarding Jews), previous party got shut down because of nazi symbolism, leader has used nazi symbolism repeatedly (run a shop with 8
8% discounts if you buy stuff above 1888 crowns, old currency, gave 1488€ to a family as charity "randomly")
Outside of the parliamet, but important:
Progresívne Slovensko: left-wing progressives
SNS: conservative right-wing populists who defrauded a lot of things
All leaders were basically retards
Most-Híd: catering to Hungarians, did a lot of shit with travel department
Spolu: center-right
Dying of salmonela
Dead, caught Hep C after birth in the hospital
At the same time, I probably wouldn't be born in a hospital back then where I would catch Hep C. But dead anyway because I had a lung infection like 3 times while a child
&#x200B;
If health is out of the equation, then I would probably be smuggling stuff across the Austrian - Hungarian border, as I was born in a town notorious for it, lying at the border of Slovakia (then part of Hungary) and Austria
Despite them being a one entity, tariffs had to be paid
I would probably drown in the Morava river while smuggling
Alternatively, getting shanked on my way from work, since crime was high as fuck back then
Become a part of bernolakovcov and become a writer and make really hard to read to understand poetry just to make it harder for students 200 years later
Given who were my ancestors at that time, I would be either a farmer, a miller (a better alternative), or something in a developing multiethnic mining settlement, probably a charcoal burner
As a male, I could be at least literate, but still probably poor
I would get married in my 20s with a girl from a nearby village and have many children (half of them would die early)
I wouldn't move far from my ancestral village during my life (if I weren't a newcomer to the mentioned mining settlement) and I could expect an epidemic of cholera 12 years later
I am totaly pro Taiwan
Sorry REPUBLIC OF CHINA (true one)
RC invest 3 or 4 times to Slovakia more than PRC (people's Republic of China)
Thay didn't violates people rights like PRC with uyghurs, and thay don't support a African dictators
Thay didn't polute so much
And mainly they didn't threaten us of embargoes exc
I don't says that RC is perfect, But I'more for slovakia lean closer to RC
Yes Taiwan is an independent country and we love to have some more cooperation with them
Plus we already know commies bad
Santa doesn't bring presents here in Slovakia
Instead, baby Jesus does, whom you can imagine where he lives
Nikolaus (Mikuláš) here comes with čert (sort of a demon, from hell), which takes little naughty kids in his bag, and Angel, who gives good kids chocolate
Needless to say, I was scared as hell by Čert when I was kid
Yes and Slovakia and Czech Republic, too
Austro-hungarian heritage ftw
It's literally just baby jesus, or rather, his form is not specified to kids
Most of our families are christian so kids are familiar with the story of Jesus
When I was kid he also got us Christmas tree, which to this day I'm not sure how "he" pulled that one off
as someone from slovakia
that’s actually almost exactly how I imagined it as a kid lmao I found it scary but I never really questioned it
No, Jesus is sitting on the right of God, as his right hand
Maybe it's because some parts of Małopolska were influenced largely by Czechs and Slovaks before (Habsburghs, especially the mountainous parts)
Also according to internet "starman" is old dude prominent in the west of poland, not in the south
Čert is basically Krampus, but doesn't come at Christmas, rather at 6
December
Also Čert is a slavic mythology creature I believe
So it's kind of weird seeing him alongside Christian myths
He's got a tumor it's not nice to talk about it
Slovak National Security Authority (NBU - Národný Bezpečnostný Úrad) having nbusr / nbusr123 as login and password
Got hacked
I like how it looks :P
You can choose between religion and ethics classes
Tell him that in Italy, it is customary to eat spaghetti by hands only, and rude using a fork
Tell him that in Italy, one must ask for ketchup on a pizza
Tell him that just like in the Eurotrip movie, he'll be considered to be a billionaire if he waves a single American dollar around in Slovakia
Tell him that just like in another bad movie, he should be vary of hot Slovak girls, as they'll likely want lure him to a non public place and have enslaved / murdered
Tell him that in Prague, it's common to ask random women on the street if they want to have sex for a few bucks and be filmed while at it
If he doesn't believe it, show him some proof #Publicagent
Tell him that when he goes through the passport control upon arriving to Europe, it is alright if he hands in his driving license instead of the passport
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
Vienna
Because then we would be ruled by people, who actually understand how to govern a state
Nitra, it's pretty large (for Slovak standards), and was the capital of the first Slavic state in modern-day Slovakia, the Principality of Nitra
Unfortunately, considering its old town was almost completely destroyed by the communist do
you get the idea, I'd go with Košice, a beautiful city, the second largest in Slovakia (with a population of 250,000, compared to the 450,000 of Bratislava)
It also has the coolest Slovak cathedral
I would actually propose Nitra, it used to be the seat of dukes
Plus it’s really nice, my personal favourite
Too bad they couldn't govern a country in 19th/20th centuries, too bad
C'mon man, everybody knows Brno is not a real thing
I, for one, suggest moving the capital to the great city of Jihlava
Phew, I thought you were going to choose Bratislava xd
Esztergom is a beautiful town
This is the way
How about you take Slovakia instead of Czechia and connect Vienna and Bratislava to make a megapolis central to the country
We'd also finally get rid of the shitshow that's our politics
Poldark intensifies
I don't know, the name reminds me of a certain Serbo-Croatian profanity too much
Let's make a West Slavic federation and have the capital be Wroclaw/Vratislav, as it was an important town both to the Czechs and the Poles a long time ago
And is about as far away from the centre of the country as it can be
A really stupid choice, we Slovaks know why
Grodno is beautiful, how about that one
Slovakia, where the capital is at the border, right next to Austria's capital: *I don't have such weaknesses*
Or Bratislava
Where my Olomouc gang at
Wait, Turin is the Italian name
I always thought the way we say it, Turín, is a complete Slovakization, as it sounds like it could just be the name of a small village in the mountains of Central Slovakia, maybe in Turiec
Does it have some history as the capital like Bratislava
Or is it just kinda central to the old borders
>Capitals work better when they are in the center of the country, making everything more connected
Sad Slovak noises
Wait, so Turin is the English name
The assembly line basically
Whole economy based around car production
Is this Slovakia
Oh wait ...
we would notice
I love that you stayed in EU, I hope it will show in the future, that it was the right move
People need to stand united to achieve great things
Also the flag is big plus
I do not think so
Very often you see in the news that Macron says this or Macron says that
He says a lot of things, but most of them are not taken seriously here in the east of EU
Everybody here just waits for what Mutti's response will be
No, you mean Chechnya
Americans would receive the news and bring the whole army to Bratislava to save you
No that's Chille
No, wherever you go to doctor they take you inn, diagnose you and send you on your merry way, no questions asked, no money paid
I cannot imagine living any different than this, beeing scared of visiting doctor with injury and shit
We have the same system as Germany, also the % are same or very simmilar, and i tought for a long time that every country in EU has it like that
Ingliš lenguidž. Bikóz of speling
Euskara, such a crazy language, but i really want to learn it lol
One hungary to the north
I agree with you
For some reason we learn very little about the Spanish Civil War and the subsequent Franco regime in our high schools
I’ve got to know more about it only because of having a Spanish boyfriend
I read a lot when it comes to history, but there are some things I don't know much about
UK : Anglo-Saxon invasion
Greece : Anything after fall of Byzantine Empire
Baltic states : I know only about Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth
But why is there the flag of Finland (?) strapped to the bicycle
Czechs and Austrians are Germans now apparently
Well, in any case, Slovaks don't wear socks and sandals, so we're safe
High Tatras and Bratislava probably
I cannot think of any other places that would receive lots of tourists (maybe other mountains or castles across the country)
Bratislava city centre and High Tatras, undoubtedly
Bratislava for foreigners, it's a usually just a stop between other Central European capitals, so they think they've seen Slovakia
High Tatras for Czech and Slovak tourists
Right now there are literal traffic jams in the hiking trails
I know about alabama and new york and texas, and florida maan ... and sydney
no wait thats different continent
Well those are it then
Ah yes, detachable prefixes
And yet it's easy for a Hungarian to learn German
I found that the sentences have a similar structure, as opposed to say, from Slovak to German
Yeah, I love the food and safety standards, most people take it for granted
Hell yeah
I love EU projects, huge fan or Erasmus and Erasmus plus and I just like that we are friends now
I want to try living in as much countries as possible and EU helps me in that
I don't think I know such people personally, but antivax and all sorts homeopathy (or bleach solutions and that BS) is getting popular especially on social medias
Then there is this "Brussels' dictate" thing, but I'm not sure it's "government don't want you to know" thing since some parties even within our government really like to use this one
Anything unpopular is basically called out as "Brussels' dictate" a.k.a. "the EU forced us to do that" and everything popular is "our government fought hard to achieve this". It's especially super weird to hear this sentiment from the party which is still a member of eurosocialists and their nominee is a vice-president of the EU commission
//edit: oh I forgot one thing
There is also quite a strong Russian influence
So all sorts of bullshit like that Egyptian pharaohs were Slavic
That there was some mummy of a Slavic beauty found in Russia dated a million years back
That there is a huge conspiracy of Germanic people to destroy or enslave Slavs within the EU and that the Russia is the only solution
I can't believe people actually believe that bullshit after what Russians did to us in 1968
When I need something my go-to is English one
But when I’m just interested in something I prefer Slovak or Czech one, because sometimes I’m lazy to read in English and translate words I don’t know xD
Absolute tragedy unreadable by anyone who has ever seen a usable wiki
If you don’t speak English, just read Czech wiki
Is drinking tap water normal it your country
If not, why
Yes very normal
In some places and especially young people its frowned upon to buy bottled water
I always ask for tap water in restaurants, because I dislike sugary sodas
Plus you can always ask them to add lemon or make a lemonade
The homemade lemonades are really popular jn Bratislava and cities
Plus the water in my hometown is delicious
Mountains
You can drink the water from toilet here, since we flush with drinking water aswell
Very abundand underground reservoirs of drinking water at Slovakia
Slovak government is just one big circus
Not worth even talking about it - corruption rate is high
Also if you have a lot of acquaintances you can literally bribe anyone and be well off
I have a hard time not seeing a stag in Prague
You were lucky
They really annoy me too
If they immigrate to the country no problem, I know some, but the pub crawls parties are the worst
They piss everywhere, climb on monuments, wear stupid things, are really loud and somehow think they can pick up girls
Yep
Still a holiday, so if the flirting goes wrong, you will never see them again
And thats a plus
I knew about every single one of them, even approximate locations for some reason(i'm not boasting I just happened to know all)
Just don't try it it's hard
Lactose **tolerance
** Europeans have the lowest lactose intolerance rates in the world
Europeans are also quite cheesy people, every country produces and consumes their own type of cheese
when your room is messy - "it's messy in here like inside a tank"
when the air is stale - "it smells in here like Tsarigrad (an archaic name of Istanbul)"
yep, same here heh
Unlike in retarded english, mostly yes
Yes 100% .... we write as we speak and read as it’s written
If I think about it
Yes
If I'm supposed to do it on spot I would struggle
Our letter ľ sounds  awfully similiar to l, and I have trouble with that a lot
Then there are y/i rules which I'm still not sure if I understand
There are chosen words in which there is Y instead of I even tho it's breaking rules
Then there are other chosen words which are not included in chosen words, because they are not chosen, but somehow are written different in different meaning (psi/psy for example
Both of those words are meant to be dogs, but both of them are right if certain requirements are met)
And lastly, there is insanely low percentage of people speaking pure slovak
Most of people are speaking with heavy dialect to the point where I don't really understand them
100% of the time, as all are spelt phonetically, except for basic grammar rules, which are usually looked over anyway
Some people say that Slovak is the Slavic Esperanto which is kind of true prehaps but not when it comes to writing things down
You nailed it in my opinion
Still not perfect but the best writing system among Slavic languages and one of the best among all languages in the world
I envy you the lack of i/y problem in Serbian
In Slovak this is a nightmare
Even adults make mistakes with pekný muži instead of pekní muži. It should be all written with i. And y should be used only in foreign words
Also why ä? It  should be peť, meso instead of the weird päť, mäso
However, one thing I like about Slovak and Czech is the marking of long and short vowels e.g. a and á. It's better than in Finish even because you can do things like praária which in Finish would be praaaria but the problem that arises is that you don't know which two are long the first two or the last two A's ? Does praaaria sound like práaria or praária
I am Slovak and the written Russian is extremely hard for me
Bulgarian, while still hard because of Cyrillic, it is easier and more phonetic and easier to remember for some reason than Russian
Russian seems to have more exceptions as well
No, in Czech and Slovak those are pronounced the same as i. For comedic effect you can pronounce it more like your y = more like the German ü but that's it
mal**ý** muž (small man) and mal**í** muži (small men) = here both ý and í sound the same
The toilet in Slovak has the best euphemism
We call it "Press Conference" (tlačová porada/shortly it's tlačovka)
In slovak: “čučoriedka” and “kôstka” (blueberry, bone)
I like words like “zmrzlina” or the czech “čtvrtsmršť” because some people apparently freak out when they see long streak of consonants without vowels
I think that řeřicha is more common
I'll do you one better
Ľalia
>Te tetted e tettetett tettet, te tettetett tettek tettese, te
This is the sound of train moving on rails with gaps
There are slang words words like "kámo" (mate) and "brácho" (bro)
But I haven't seen them being used too much, but that might be because I am getting old
We usually just refer to each others by their name
There is a well carved deep into the rock that the castle of Trenčín is built on, allegedly by a Turkish nobleman named Omar, in exchange for the release of his fianceé Fatimah from captivity
Also, the famous chess-playing automaton devised by Wolfgang Kepmelen in Bratislava in the 18th century is rumored only to be a hollow doll, secretly "housing" a Turkish amputee, who was very good at chess
Except for the New Year's eve nothing, but I wonder if any Norwegians have considered celebrating the 8th of May with fireworks, in undying memory of Josef Terboven's spectacular way of departure
officialy it's only New year's eve, but some people do it also on Christmas
Fireworks are allowed only 1 hour on new years
Rest of the year its against the law to fire them on the whole territory
It happens from time to time of course, but its not allowed
For those too lazy to read wikipedia: Norwegian nazi who blew himself up with 50kg of dynamite
Also the islands are self governing and even tho their citizens have EU passports and can live in any EÚ country, it does not apply both ways
Some regulations since not all of EU can fit onto Canary Islands
Huh ... so I can go to canary and stay there forever and ever ... huh ... welp t´was boring life here anyway
During WWI, when Czechoslovakia was just forming, we successfully defeated Russia in a naval battle, despite being a ladlocked country and having no navy
Czechoslovak troops in Siberia seized a military vessel on the lake Baikal and used it to sink another military vessel
Also, they took control of the Transsiberian railway for a couple of weeks, effectively conquering half of Russian territory
Cool but do you mean Buda or Pest
Slovakia has the highest number of castles per person
Whaaat, do people in Norway still know how to wash dishes manually
I'd expect you Scandinavians to only use dishwashers with closed circut of water, powered by biomass generated from food leftovers from the previous run
I guess you can call it an improvised military vessel
Nah, you know, just chillin'...
But seriously, [here] a quick introduction
Just Байкал.
Although on my second thoughts, that wouldn't be carbon neutral, still
Curiously, taxonomy is the only part of Czech and Slovak vocabulary, where adjectives come after nouns, as it is habitual in Polish
So you don't really have to swap them, but I suppose it sounds even funnier to you that way, which is the point
We had those as well during socialism, my grandma used to be one
She hasn't told me much about it, except that it was required of her and her fellow pioneers to attend public festivities and street marches celebrating socialism and the government
She was also one of the pioneers who carried the flag in a parade when Fidel Castro visited Slovakia in June of 1972 and was hosted in Nitra (one of the largest and oldest cities in Slovakia)
She said she had liked being a pioneer, but also said the constant marching in the streets of Nitra was really tiring for her (they would often march for hours while carrying flags)
I live in a city in Slovakia, that's built on old Roman outpost called Laugaricio
There is some roman writing on the wall of the rock upon which the medieval lords of this area build a beautiful castle
Before Romans, there were Celts here, as well
Fun fact; The opening battle in Gladiator took place here and the writing on the wall was written to celebrate it
Never
Packages are either delivered by courier and signed off, handed over at post with identification, or if you want at a shop which participates in 'zásielkovňa' in which case you get a special code
I never understood why packages in USA get left at the doorstep
You would think that because most people order from Amazon and such it would be more secure
Ah, Amazon
I wonder when was the last time I read something good about amazon, especially concerning their workers
Sofia, the whole city is one street with shops and commie blocks
Well come to Svit in Slovakia
Basically commies build it to house people who worked in factories there
It's terrible
It has no soul
Well maybe old non existent commie soul
Sofia is the twin city of Bratislava, lol
Can relate
I agree
We should definitely bulldoze down the parliament
The building is shit, and so are its residents
"d" in the word "zmrd" is pronounced as "t"
šukať is slovak
šukat is czech
The university tuition is mostly free in Slovakia
The main issue is that the overall education level is really bad
Teachers are, quite often, uneducated, cheating is common
Having a Master’s degree there is no big deal
The biggest idiots have 2 or more
Studying is free of charge for most of the common cases
Basically you got two ways in which you can study - daily (attending courses every day) or distant (getting materials, self studying it, having courses once in a while e.g. during weekend)
Distant form is paid
Daily form is free if taught in official (Slovak) or minority language
If it's taught in foreign language (e.g. English) it's usually always paid
I think there is an exception in case that study program is not offered in official language on any other university, but for simplicity, studying in foreign language is almost always paid
Then there is this thing with regular length of study for daily
For bachelor degree it's usually 3 years, for masters it's two years and there are some exceptions for some specific study programs e.g. medicine (where it is 5 or 6 years)
Anyway, studying withing regular length is completely free
If exceeding the regular length it's about 600€ per whole school year
You can ask the university to decrease or completely forgive this fee one time if you got a good reason for extension
E.g. I studied abroad one year and I extended my study period by 1 year because of it, the fee was completely forgiven by the university
TL;DR: Studying in Slovakia is free if you study a program taught in official national or minority language and you don't exceed the regular length of study for your program
//edit: maybe I should add there are some other costs associated with studying
E.g. getting your university card (entitling you to free travels by trains within Slovakia and several other discounts)
Those are usually very low
Then there is cost for dormitory or renting a private room (unless your parents live close to the university so you can stay with them)
Dormitory is usually pretty cheap, somewhere between 50-100€ per month
As a foreigner you'll usually have no problem getting one
Maybe with exception of studying in Bratislava since amount of students exceed the dormitory capacity a lot
If you come from low income families you can apply for social stipendium
Part of it is fully covering the dormitory costs (but not private room/house renting)
Then there is costs associated with food
Food is generally cheap in Slovakia and even cheaper at school canteen since it's partially funded by university/government
In my times (about 5 years ago) it was about 1
50€~2€ per meal
Below 1€ for breakfast meal

Ahoj, volám sa Ján. Rád ťa spoznávam
Odkiaľ si
Hi, called John
Glad you knowing
Where from are
Alternatively, you could go for a more literal translation
Ahoj, moje meno je Ján. Je mi potešením ťa stretnúť. Odkiaľ si ty
Hi, my name is John
Is me pleasure you meet
Where from are you
Ahoj , moje meno je Ján. Rád ťa spoznávam
Odkiaľ si ?
Hi, my name is John
I pleasure you meet
Where you from
So they finally found the hot singles in the area ?

The one with executive power is Prime Minister who basically govern the country as the leader of praliament/government
President as written below is supposed to be less controversial figure, who keep nation united (because PM can be quite polarized person for obvious politicial bias), also as written below, there are expectations that government can change and president should stay (even has longer serving period)
Also president has mostly representative function, but has some power, her/she is the highest chief of army, can veto law, gives amnesties, names judges etc
In slovakia this works pretty much like magic
Our PMs were mostly controversial trough all the modern history, and our presidents were less polarized persons who kept them in check
Especially the last two presidents, it we had different ones, we would be most likely on the same route Poland and Hungary are at the very moment
>someone less controversial, who isn't an active member of a particular political party and gives the people a sense of unity and wisdom (at least in theory)
Made me gigle thinking of your president
That is quite interesting, because we have direct presidential elections since forever and we always managed to pick up someone okayish
How was it before the direct elections, who used to pick up the president
That seems also dangerous, if one party has too much power in government, they can just choose "their guy"
Because for example over here, president stops those ridiculous proposals etc
If one group control government and president office, they have unlimited power basically
There were few such attempts in slovakia, and people always voted for the "second worse", even the last presidential election were on that route, if the other candidate won, we would have very different political situation over here and we will be there with poland and hungary
We celebrete it, but most of the people don't notice
I think that the biggest cause is that fo many decades we celebrated 9th of May as end of the WW2 (commonly accepted date is 8th May, when Nazi Germany surrendered and allies liberated Prague)
But Soviet powers marched to Prague a day later
Also according to [Wikipedia] when Germany surrendered in the evening of May 8th, it was May 9th of Moscow time already
And thus all of the Eastern block adopted the latter date
Edit: I forgot to mention that we reverted back to 8th of May, but many older people can't really accept it (and I don't blame them, I would probably do the same in that age
And Košice (secont biggest city by pop
) celebrate the town status given to them on 9
1369
(I just found out that because of this Europe's day is celebrated in Košice on [6th of May] don't ask me why)
(Pls correct me if the facts are wrong)
Jesus Christ, no
Showing how "European" you are is cringey
Government buildings already fly them all year long
The Shop on Main Street
The Line
Lóve
These are the ones I like the most
Únos (2017)
Trhlina (2019)
Though these will be difficult to watch without knowledge of our country
Ja, Oľga Hepnarová (2016) is good, but that is a French-Czech-Polish-Slovak coproduction
The shop on main street
Won an Oscar
I would go with Pacho Hýbsky zbojník.
OP is polish so they probably know enough about the good highwayman archetype, especially Jánošík. The movie is a gem, but it does rely heavily on knowledge of the highwayman stories
Poland is suspiciously quiet
Slovak Parliament
Some of them are alien
They claim having no such list, it is all conspiracy theorist
Just not in the winter
I can see how ukraine would be way more welcoming
I like this about europeans a lot
In US for comment like this, people would be apologizing in morning tv show
I had to google it up, and found out independence day in poland (and the us tv show was meant for my comment about quiet poland)
In Poland
Again
I really like our president so I wouldn’t change her
Our PM is not much, but he’s better than last two PMs
I would change him for Iceland’s or New Zealand’s prime minister
Our president is the most trusted politician here so I wouldn't change her
Our PM tho
well, better than the current opposition but still leaves a lot to be desired
I've been hearing only good things about  Jacinda Ardern (NZ PM), can some kiwis confirm, or is she a lizard in disguise
Čaputova forever
Wouldn’t the independence of Northern Ireland help with this
From what I know about Duda
BoJo is actually an improvement
He is still the corrupt narcissistic opportunist like Duda, but at least he is not as big on LGBT suppression nor on abortion bans
But then isn’t it worse to be stuck in this state in between
In Slovak, you can tell quite a lot with a simple “noo…”
[as you can see in this post]
no ani som si neuvedomil že no ma toľko významov lol
haha i would be able to pronounce it
Nooo, hej no
same as "*okej*" in Slovak, and also similar with more positive connotation of it
We exist
"Yes, we were separated
My country didn’t exist in 1919 yet haha so idk how to answer
Probably the forming [new Bratislava downtown] Probably contrary to what most people from the west picture (if they picture anything at all), Bratislava is becoming a very modern city, with plenty of new high-rise buildings and well developed infrastructure
Our translators often add the suffix -ová to female surnames, which makes them sound very weird, at least in my opinion
Also a lot of them translate word-to-word, which can result in really bizarre translations (especially when it comes idioms or proverbs)
For example Bilbo Baggins was translated in the first Slovak version of The Hobbit as Bilbo Lazník (lazy is the name for very small villages in mountains with scattered houses in certain parts of Slovakia), and in the second translation his surname was changed to Bublík (really can't find the connection between Bublík and Baggins, since Bublík sounds like something related to bubbles or some shit)
Our translation of Harry Potter is quite infamous and is regarded by many to be of a poor quality
The translator changed the names of the founders of Hogwarts (Godric Gryffindor is suddenly Richard Chrabromil, Rowena Ravenclaw is Brunhilda Bystrohlavová, Helga Hufflepuff is Brigita Bifľomorová, only Salazar stayed the same) and translated Hogwarts to Rokfort, instead of Bradavice
You should check out the Czech translation for Harry Potter, it is interesting at the least
What was in the Czech translation of ASOIAF
Any weird name changes
But to be fair, I love Czech translation of Lort but with Harry Potter was I was alway torn, because Bradavice didn't go well with me
Brumbal is all and well, but it just doesn't pack punch as Dumbledore
And yes I know Brumbal is also some thing as Dumbledore, so not a bad job
I just always lived how long his name was
I felt like in context of English language and their often weird names as Liverpool it kinda makes sense, but with Bradavice, that's medical condition
But then again what you expect when someone names a school Hogwarts
The translator must have been freaking out
But all the fame and splendour comes to your translation of Terry Pratchett books
That must be a freaking hard job
New Czech translations of ASOIAF feature the sin of adding suffix -ová to female surnames, like Daenerys Targaryenová or Cersei Lannisterová.
I liked ours as well
Both of them did a great job
However didn't really care about names as much as a kid, because if you translated one then you have to do all, and Harry Potter too
To me as a kid were just names
I just personally found Bradavice weird
So I am glad we went Rokfort way too
It gave you the Oxford school name vibe
It looks weird AF, since every single ASOIAF name is too 'foreign-sounding' for it not to look weird
Older translations of the books in Czech don't contain the suffix -ová, but I suspect that the Slovak translation of ASOIAF is to be blamed, since it was the first one to use it
Exkuse me sir, I hev noticed zat you honked on me, alzou my inefficiency at driving was under 0

Me too
Because swearing in English kinda doesn't feel like swearing
Its just another language
But hoho if you hear me swear in ma native language, you bet I am pissed
Also makes me feel a bit - ups I said a bad word whereas in english its fuck fuck cunt whatever, just foreign language
Hahahahaha I wish
You could say that Bratislava is kinda hated by it's own citizens
So maybe that counts
Never heard that in my life, personally I love my city
2011 - Over sending financial aid to Greece (although that was more like the last straw, the coalition was incredily wobbly from the get go)
2018 - More like a controlled PM swap from Fico to Pellegrini
For young people yes
If there is someone on 20-30 and doesnt understand english at all, it is strange, at least as far as i know
You have to take an exam from a foreign language (B1 or B2 usually) in order to graduate from high school
I'm saving this comment
Relatable af
Isn't this kind of rude anywhere
Unless we are cooking dinner at friends house, I don't think I would feel comfortable snooping in someone fridge, anywhere in the world
Dont touch shit that aint yours, thats a common sense aint it
Marián Kotleba
He is a leader of a nationalist political party, and it would be just really hilarious if he got sent to Hungary
No thx, we've got plenty of shitty politicians already
Maybe the Poles or the Hungarians would be interested
Would you be interested in more of our exports
Robert Fico
Marian Kotleba, perhaps
Look how liked Babis is there, we can guarantee the best quality of corruption
>Make Andrej Babiš Slovak again
Pls no
the name must be in some kind of name database
as there is a proof that it exists as a given name
if the name has only one version, ti can be given for both boys and girls, if the name has feminine and masculine version, they must be given accordingly to boys and girls
fun fact: Daenerys is a version of ancient greek name
I suppose it is Deianira
Elektra and Thor are also ancient mythical names
and the mystery is solved
we have nicknames allowed as first name, too
if they exist as given name as well
so Ella, Elena, Elia and Elaria, Eleonora, Elinor are O.K.
some parents switch to hungarian
if kids know better or only slovak
or slovak
if they know better or only hungarian
my great-grandparents used hungarian to argue
they weren´t hungarian
as some other people already wrote here, it's super nice of them if they can actually carry on a conversation (even a simple one), but it's super annoying if they can only say a few words and push it and then you don't understand each other at all, like the types that walk around with a phrasebook and just read stuff from there, mispronounce everything (obviously) and you have no idea what they're trying to say, which wouldn't be a problem if they spoke English instead
Depends who and how
Especially Americans tend to butcher our language in ways we have absolutely zero idea what they’re saying
But from the other side whenever I vacation in southern Europe (Spain, Italy, Croatia, Bulgaria) and try to speak their languages people seem to be genuinely happy
If they can do it at a comprehensible level, I'd be very impressed since it has a very steep learning curve
I’ve studied French for 6 years in high school
When I went to Paris I’ve tried speaking French couple of times, people understood me and replied in french and I couldn’t understood a word they were saying
Do you actually dislike each other
I always thought we three just make fun of each other's bullshit
I am surprised I didn't find a comment from a Bulgarian, which would say rose extract
Anyway, I have no idea what my country would smell of
Maybe no smell at all is it most significant trait, just fresh mountain air
Hahah, honesty at first place I see
Where were you
When I opened this section I thought this answer for Bulgaria would be in the top 5
I thought of mountain fresh air too
I asked my family and they said mountain air as well, but also mentioned the smell of sheep or cattle
If I may interfere I would pick thyme for you instead
I have oregano associated rather with Italy
Oh yes, sheep fleece would be a great pick too
Unbearably
^Don't ^bother, ^I'll ^show ^myself ^out
During my life I've often visited two towns where the population is decreasing rapidly (about 15 % in 20 years)
The decrease is surprisingly invisible - new houses, shops and facilities have been built during these years, they don't seem to be in decline overall
Bulgaria lost around 2 mil people since  fall of communism
That is sad
This is true
It happens from time to time that some smuggling tunnel is discovered on Slovak-Ukrainian border
Or some drone is spotted and so on
Sometimes people try to smuggle cigarettes in some hidden compartments of their car but due to Schengen the border is heavily monitored
Anyway, some cigarettes still get through
Another thing is that weed is relatively safe drug
If that one is out of the game they might move on something more dangerous
Mafia won't die out just because some part of their business is gone
They'll adapt
This sounds silly, but as a little kid I believed that the coast of any seaside country looks like the edge of a swimming pool with a ladder leading down to the sea
I was confused when I first saw a sand beach in Italy and then I when I got back home from the vacation I was telling my friends how Italy has a sand playground leading to the sea unlike other countries and that is the reason why people vacation in Italy so they can play on their sand playgrounds with water
My route of choosing would be
Valencia - Nice - Venice - Prague - Košice
Because why not
I have no idea why but I always end up dating austrian girls
We tend to click easily and we share somewhat a dark sense of humor
Dont tell anyone
Not really
Mostly, the only generation we refer to are Gustav Husák's children, which are essentially baby boomers, nothing else besides that
Conjunctions mostly (mostly probably entirely)
It is
But I personally never had a problem, saying how much I get payed, when someone asks
That being said, so far I only worked part-time and had hourly salary, so I dont know how I would feel about discussing my static monthly salary, but I think I would still be comfortable with it, if somebody asked
I would say the green ones
The black ones are mostly found in salads, on pizza, but green ones are popular also being filled with something (almonds, tomato paste
) and eaten as a snack
You can get both, but I’d say people prefer green  olives
For a nation that didnt exist on the map for 1000 years we have an interesting language history
Our language started as Proto-Slavic common with other Slavic nations
As a written language however, Slovak started in Great Moravia in the 9th century when Cyril and Methodius invented the glagolic alphabet , from this period you can google st
Gorazd prayer, despite being a millenia old, it is somewhat understandable
( some sentences make sense completely, other have strange words, others are completely strange)
Eventually Glagolic got replaced with Latin alphabet and language, followers of Cyril and Methodius fled to the east where they invented Cyrilic which is still used today
Slovak during medieval age developed rather slowly , as it was overshadowed by latin and hungarian
In the 14th century Czech language made its way to Slovakia (northern Hungary back then) and Slovakized Czech became a thing which paved way for the similarities between Slovak and Czech that we know today
Fastforward to 19th century, we have Slovak national awakening with many writers who improved the Slovak language to more or less the form that we have now
And lastly , when Czechoslovakia formed in 1918, putting Slovakia(kinda) on the map after 1000 years , we started "crossing out" words that came from German and Hungarian and replacing them with Czech and Polish words (so that they sound more Slavic) . And thats the language we have today
Generally for an average Slovak speaker, every version of "Slovak" is to some extend understandable, of course the further into history you go the harder it gets, but that applies to every language
thanks for this great summary, I wouldn’t write it better
interesting fact: after inventing glagolic and translating Bible to it, this old Slavonic was accepted as the fourth liturgical language,
Great Moravia gained bishop and church there wasn’t controlled by Frank bishops (for a while)
Non-native English speakers, what is the most typical calque your countrymen incorrectly use, when they speak English
For example, the word for door is always plural in Slovak and you can often hear Slovaks say they "opened the doors" or so, even though they mean just one door
As a fellow Slovak, I struggle with Slovak cities with names in plural - Košice, Michalovce, etc
I tend to say “Košice are the second biggest city in Slovakia”, as I would in Slovak, rather than Košice is
Also watch / watches (always plural in Slovak)
I myself, a Slovak, have still problems using 'dress' as a singular, since in Slovak it's plural
And 'hair' sometimes too
IDK why but I often notice (and get annoyed by) pronunciation errors more than small grammar mistakes
Like most people around here (Slovakia and neighboring countries) can’t pronounce english V and R properly
And French people can’t pronounce H and U.
Im just imagining a blonde blue eyed Joe Pesci with a Swedish accent sitting on an ikea chair eating meatballs: "Funny how
Funny like I'm a clown
Like am I here to amuse you
Skrattar du vorlarar du
Oh lord, no more shootings in Austria, please
But I think you can use police in singular too, when you rather mean the whole organization, can't you
Russians very thrifty with the verb "to be", too
> one letter corresponds to — gasp
— one sound
Oh really
How many times do I have to tell Poles to learn to use š,č and ř, because half of the letters they write, namely z-s, are simply **not there**!
I meant that I would probably say "Police exist*s* to maintain law and order
" Would it be too weird
Nope
Does the "sz" in "Nos Zbigniewa" sound to you as the "sz" in Bydgoszcz
Maybe it is native English speakers, who should get it right
But the word "actually" is so flexible and ellegant, we should just adopt it
We should totally start a petition
And they should switch to "ananas", "beton" and "gepard" too
Regardless, English marks the same sound as "sh". How does "h" equal to "z", then
In Slovakia it is mandatory to have an ID card - [Slovak ID] \- once you are 15 years old
Originally I thought that EU countires would have some norm at least in design, but obviously not (however, this applies to [driving licences] and passports)
Since 2013, version equipped with electrinic chip is provided, so communication with government or your city can be done online (like taxes, request for car registration, changes in marital status, etc)
It is heavily used in every contact with government, banking, municipalities, employers and so on (e.g. if stopped by police while driving, if you'd like to request a price reduction for travelling, if signing a contract with telecom operators, or if renting a flat)
In special cases, passport can be used as verification
Nothing extraordinary is listed there besides standard info (where/when born, address), but you can add some remarks, such as academic title, blood type or serious medical conditions
Vienna, Vienna, Vienna, Vienna, Bratislava
We were Austria-Hungary until 1st world war
Then until 1993, Prague was the biggest city in Czechoslovakia
Since independence in 1993, Bratislava is our biggest city and capital
Second would be Košice, then Prešov
Kutná Hora was a very close second until the 16th century
So elegant
Slovakian superiority shining through in 1600s
Trávnik is lawn in Slovak too:)
The point is it wasn't a relatively small town, in the Middle Ages, it was the second biggest Czech town
Ah, Runescape
I see you're a man of culture as well
I was in Turku, and there was this greek girl (from Tessaloniki I think) who spent the whole time bitching about how cold it was
It was unironically very entertaining
I know a guy from Košice who was studying in Ostrava I think and did Erasmus in Kosice  so he was staying at home and getting paid
But it was years ago, now it's impossible to do Erasmus in your native country
But there are still people doing Erasmus just across borders in Vienna, Krakow or Ostrava
I have 100% success rate recognizing a Finn by his english accent
About that, I had a coworker who looked super Turkish
Despite being 100% small village Slovakian
When they went to Turkey people just kept talking to him as if he was local
He loved it
That's actually pretty useful
Lot of runners use it too
Pretty standard for hiking
Its amazing for joints health
Aka I use them in my thirties, especially for going down because I have iffy knees
“Z Komára Somára” (Turn a mosquito into a donkey) It basically is said when the person you’re talking to is over-exaggerating things
We have mosquito and donkey
In Slovakia we have “Jazykovedný ústav Ľudovíta Štúra” according to google translate: Ľudovít Štúr Institute of Linguistics
Reminds me of how terribly Spanish people must feel when someone is surprised that they can speak Mexican
A song defining slovak culture is [Citim vôňu lesa (borovička song)] ... well, borovička is a typical slovak brandy and there is no household without it + the party beat makes it a perfect party song
For more chilling and moving atmosphere, [Hrdza - Slovensko moje, otčina moja]
And my personal favourite since my childhood: [Kristina - Horehronie] she sings about the central region in Slovakia and defines the typical slovak landscape and nature
I think most viewed is however [Ego - žijeme len raz] which is a summer dance song and is played at almost every party in summer
And as for Romainian metal, Bucovina is just superb
I will add:
[Peter Bič Project - Hey Now] was popular even abroad
[Peter Bič Project - Where Did You Go] with a new singer
Another one by [Hrdza - Košieľočka]
[The Bridgeheads - Fire]
[Bad Karma Boy - Dunaj]
[Tublatanka - Spálená láska]
Not at all, which is a shame because there are many accents to choose from
What I can remember is cooperation between some Czech and Slovak studios when dubbing Alvin and Chipmunks, where some characters were Czech and some Slovak
I believe the dubbing was the best part of the movie
Almost every region has it's own accent
But generaly slovaks divide the Slovak language into 3 sub groups: Western Slovak, Central Slovak and Eastern Slovak
And for each one, the other one sounds funny
Yes
Despite being small country, we are divided into many dialect groups
However, they seem to slowly disappear, because younger generations speak mostly standardized language taught in schools
(but no one speak that soft as it should be, only Slovaks in middle of Slovakia , and I don’t like it at all :D )
That’s just strange, I mean I get it, but still, it’s a bit strange
Probably Komárno, but I'm not sure
Also Štúrovo/Esztergom, right
Yep Sátoraljaúhely/Slovenské Nové Mesto
That's stupid
It's not even a town, rather a village
Why not give the whole town to Hungary
Honestly, the founders of the country were sometimes just too harsh on Hungary
Komarno ok, makes sense due to the Danube sort of, but this is just laughable
Oh absolutely, the name is stupid
Same goes for Slovakia
That’s actually interesting, do you have a link to this legend
Anyway, I personally, have no problems with Hungarians
In my opinion both sides treated each other unfairly at times and it is good that the revanchism has stopped, however, there is still quite a sizeable amount of, I guess, your far-right countrymen who like to provoke Slovaks in the YouTube comment sections of their own anthem
This, and our history lessons, which totally suck btw and leave out certain facts, are the sole reasons for many young Slovaks’ unfavourable opinions about Hungarians
It’s quite a shame honestly, since our nations have so much in common, it’s just that we kind of disregarded it for the last two centuries
Fascinating read, thank you very much
Yeah like comfy sweatpants and sweatshirts but then i also wear old clothes at home (especially t-shirt that i don’t like anymore)
but i mostly just wear my pj’s when i’m home
[The legendary one]
really creative people live there do they
Bilbao, i want to go there on EURO 2021, even though probably won't, i know that it's quite far future but i doubt that i will go somewhere else until that time lol
If you want to experience Czech culture then visit a smaller Czech city like Znojmo/Mikulov/Plzen/Brno or similar, since Prague is nowadays pretty much just a tourist city like all others
Yes, it is
I was there because I was backpacking around Europe and just got of the flixbus after not sleeping whole night
You know, typical backpack get up plus the give me coffee or I die look
Jeez, I felt so out of place
I generally think I am not a totally ugly person, but there i was super conscious about what was I wearing and how I looked
Everything was so quiet and clean
For some reason my and my friend thought people are staring at us and judging us as we wandered around
I saw a shiny gold car with some arabic plates once when I was in Paris near Champs Elysees
Zavináč - rolled pickled herring(it also means the same as well here)
It’s called zavináč which translates into English as a rollmops
Exactly the same in Slovak
Goes for the fish too
There is also "[závin] a pastry filled and rolled with various stuff (cocoa or poppy seed are common)
I associated more "zavináč" with this
But it's the same root, "zavinúť", "to roll up".
I always cheer for Czechs
Unless we play against each other
And then I will be pro Slovenia, Poland and so
And I love cheering for the underdogs
And that's often us
Unless it's Sagan
In hockey I root for Czechs and for Finland
In football it’s bit different, I just choose anyone who is somehow interesting for me
Last WC I rooted for Belgium
As a Slovak I tend to cheer for Finland in icehockey as we share some traits
Both of us are the "smaller bro" to Czechia and Sweden respectively, we have similar population size, we both feature blie/white jerseys, and we both are pretty good drinkers and just get along well
For me the same
But in hockey I cheer for finns
I like finns
I see how it is
yep, and the other way around as well :)
No worries, I was just joking
Anyway I would cheer for you too
Best wishes neighbours
dont you have to pay for bus
Wouldnt that just slow down the proccess
And East too
Small talk is probably even weirder in Slovakia than in Germany
I can't even imagine random Slovaks stopping me to talk
It only happened to me in London
It was weird, but also kind of refreshing
For real
Brits don't get the memo when travelling abroad, but fights and loud aggressive screeching isn't the norm elsewhere
Like, seriously, the times I've seen British tourists acting worse than Chinese tourists is incredible
Here there are two ways to drink coffee usually
Turkish - where the powder stays in your cup in the end
Nesca - short for Nescafe meaning any instant
Medium to large
The presso thing is funny to us, you expect the same quantity of coffee like you'd get tea, tf am I supposed to do with 1,5 gulps
Dunno why, but I really hit me more In Uk
I lived in Plymouth and the weather was constantly the same
Mizzle and drizzle, windy all the time
Me an my Spanish friends we had to wear coats in summer which was just not right
And the insulation on our house was terrible despite being in one of the really nice parts
It was soo cold inside we used to congregate in the kitchen because we could warm that one up
But then London that's another other thing
It's just much more fun
Even weather was much more fun
It was like living in a different country
Yeah, we're lucky it's lockdown
also r/rimjob_steve
Interesting, in Slovakia, a 90k town would be one of the largest towns in the country, but wherever you go except for the mountains, it's filled with villages and small towns, in every possible direction
Especially some good home-made pálenka, the one thing that unites us all over here
Yep, it's the same here, we just call both "mesto".
Yeah, "city" used to be "hrad" in Slovak, like in all other Slavic languages (grod, gorod
), but for some reason, West Slavs (at least those are the ones I know about) just replaced it with "place" and called it a day
Hrad nowadays means "castle".
Nope
That's if I'm not mistaken a Medieval innovation, just a natural change in languages
Words change meaning
And we never "purged" our language of our own native non-Russian words for no reason, we actually introduced many Russian words for exotic animals and other various things to get rid of German loanwords, so it's the other way around, Czech and Slovak moved closer to Russian and farther away from Romance and Germanic languages in the 19th century in its vocabulary
Yeah, a similar thing to that "hrad" situation happens to Slovaks with Polish, a shit ton of words sound almost the same but have different, sometimes opposite meanings
It's quite confusing lol
Funny ones are "droga", it means "road" in Polish but "drug" in Czech, "šukat" means "to fuck" in Czech but szukać means "to search" in Polish, "zachod" means "west" in Polish but "záchod" means "toilet" in Czech and Slovak
So you can technicelly say "Szukam go na zachodzie" meaning "I'm looking for him in the west", but a Czech or a Slovak will think you're fucking someone on the toilet, as they think it should be translated as "Šukám ho na záchode".
Yeah, Polish is probably closer to Russian than Czech and Slovak are, we're already transitioning into more Germanic-influenced speech (like sounding like robots instead of singing while talking) and Standard Slovak also has many South Slavic features
But still, Polish as a language is much closer to Czech and Slovak than it is to Russian
What was he doing in Irak
Visiting a friend
No, Iran is trying to get a hold of Irak
Maybe you haven't noticed but the leader of Iran is a religious dictator for life that has the last word in everything
Why
Hungary
China is already invading Europe
Surprised nobody mentions that
I guess economical invasion is easily overlooked due to no immediate casualties
That's why it's perhaps even more dangerous
*ahem* H U N G A R Y
(just joking ily Hungary)
Russia or Hungary
these are like classics lol
(Slovakia)
Sameeee
r/unexpectedcommunism
As a perspective vassals of China, we might
They already debt trapped some balkan countries and got a major influence in several EU countries
EU itself warned member states on that matter
Thinking this is a huge mistake
China has a pretty great control over their middle class, check this short documentary series for examples :) [
Imo, Horkýže Slíže - Váňa z Vorkuty ; Gleb - Motorest
"Ta Ne" by Kristína
It's a song about relationship between western and eastern slovak, (eastern Slovaks speak incredibly different slovak language then rest of slovaks thanks to them being near Ukraine so we often don't know what they are talking about
It's like Irish and English, but far more different) and incredibly catchy song
Szegény vagyok
isn't Váňa z Vorkuty in Russian
I agree with Gleb though, his latest album is great
Yup , it is , but HS are from Slovakia
Btw , how did you get that country tag
But Vana Z Vorkuty is from Bijouterrier :D
I know I know, Kuko is hosting there

Ok, Ďakujem,  vyskúšam to
In versions from Slovakia he had informal style with a lot of mistakes, mainly when he was writing letters
For instance everything in Slovakia is všetko, je was saying šecko
And placing of words in sentence was not so common
He sounded more like he was from east of the country
For us it’s ťahák, based on the word ťahať-pull
I believe we share it with the Czechs :)
in slovak it's 'ťahák'. it could be translated as 'puller'
Or a sleeve
We would put it in a sleeve and pull it out when the teacher wasn't looking
Haha it’s amazing how Czechia and Slovakia just act like the same country on reddit ️
It depends on school, in primary school each class had a locker room for jacket, shoes, but not for books
In secondary school we had lockers shared by 2-3 students for jacket, shoes and there was also a shelf where we could leave books we didn't need at home
We did in my school but not many schools have them
[ in Slovakia we are using long system like you
The city of Odessa, Ukraine, has a vast and fascinating network of catacombs as well
There are some in Edinburgh too
Both accessible for tourists with a guide
Do you know, by any chance, about any catacombs in Slovakia
Surely there are some beneath several castles
Červený kameň has very impressive ones; some are also beneath the Nitra castle but they are accessible only on special occassions, once or twice a year (btw
Jozef Tiso is buried there, so you can bring a keyboard down there and press F to pay respect, or you can spit on the grave, depending on which side of the political spectre you are leaning towards)
There is some small ossuary below the center of Bratislava, near the Old Market building, but it is also closed for most of the year, and that's pretty much all I know from top of my head
Surely, Google can tell you more
Wow, thanks a lot :)
Most castles per capita ️
Most casualties during WWII
Including from other Soviet Republics, but most were Russian
You were also the most liberal country back during the Soviet era
Yeah, its really tragic, Soviet citizens and the red army payed the highest price to free the world from fascism, we will be forever thankful ️
China is second highest
I struggle to imagine Finns, plural, together in as tight a space as a bus
Would you do it in the subway
When I was in London and went somewhere by bus for the first time, I got pretty confused looks by everyone inside, since I got on the bus through the second door, and not through the front door like everyone else
Then I realized the card reader thing is only next to the driver
so I had to do a walk of shame
Here in Slovakia you can get on the bus using whichever door you want, since the ticket / card devices are placed behind every door
Well, I'm talking about public transportation of a single city
There are machines where you can buy tickets next to all bigger bus-stops
Then you simply get on, "mark" the ticket in the bus and get off
If you have a pass, you simply get on and off whenever and wherever you want
On intercity buses, between for example Bratislava and another city, the only way you can get on is by the front door and you have to buy a ticket off the driver as well
Following your isles discussion as a central European I am like wtf
To be honest this really hits me
Not only because I was a long time Blizzard fan, but I also have friends in the region (mostly in Taiwan tho - the country the two fired casters are from)
I get it that doing business with China became quite an industry standard, but even that should have it's limits and we shouldn't sacrifice our core values to please totalitarian regimes
I also understand that Blizzard has the right to distance themselves from politics and I wouldn't mind if they issue some warning towards the player and make a statement in which they distance themselves from his act or even fine him a bit (deduct some part of prize money in that tournament), but what they did is simply too much
Banning him for a whole year
Taking away all his prize money even from the previous events
And even firing the casters
For a short statement to support of the protesters
Wtf
Company which has an Orc statue at their HQ with writing saying "Every voice matters"? I already uninstalled all their games and the game launcher from my devices
I wasn't just casual free to play player, I spent over 1000€ in past 3 years on their games
So I hope there will be more like me doing the same
I will also follow up with the request to see my personal data they store
According to article 21 of universal human rights, everyone has the Right to Democracy
I see the action done by Blizzard as violation of this
Furthermore, my country suffered quite a lot under communist regime from which we still didn't full recovered and we were even occupied by USSR just because we started to implement democratic reforms back in 1968
So I can understand how people in Hong Kong feel
Therefore, I cannot really continue to support Blizzard and I'll fully support the Hong Kong protesters instead
Yep, I would be okay if they distanced themselves from the player statements, but doing all that to him
That a mark of an authoritarianism, of a government who wants to control and extort their people
Feels totally as a communism move, and I won't ever support that
Big peepee
I think Turkey should be kicked out from NATO and forget about joining EU until they stop to oppress Kurds
They rightfully deserve their own state

Sorry, but this is genius
After finishing my Master's degree 3 years ago,  I moved back with my mother to her apartment and started saving up for a house
A year later, my girlfriend of then 4 years (with which I used to live at the college dorm), moved in with us and we're currently in the planning phase of our new house - got the land all paid for, project documentation done and currently working to get mortgage
Probably would have started a year earlier if COVID didn't strike this year
Anyways - we don't openly discuss the details of our sex-life (pretty regular - sometimes a few times a week, sometimes we go a week without), but we're not like pretending not to, even though my family is catholic
Probably helps that my parents are separated and that my mother leaves to spend weekend with my dad at our cottage - so we have the place completely to ourselves at least a couple days per week
I like ours
"Nad Tatrou sa blyska" is a classic
It's basically about how the Slovak nation will rise, while there's a thunderstorm over the Tatra mountains and how the thunder is forcing Slovaks to rise and fight to live
I love thunder part of Slovak anthem but as someone said here , that it's about fighting
That's not true, since only first two parts of song are national anthem
Second thing yes, maybe there is word about taking a sabre and standing in the line, but take it more like stand up for yourself than attack someone
In Slovakia
Can't remember any such words, but mostly because almost every word we use can be "colored" and made to sound childish by adding suffixes in the end
"Strom" (tree) = "Stromček" (lil' tree)
"Jablko" (apple) = "Jabĺčko" (lil' apple)
"Mačka" (cat) = "Mačička" (cute little cat)
And on and on
The suffixes are mainly in form of "-ka" "-čka" "-ko" "-ík" etc
and just make the item smaller or cuter
Vould be applied on names too, something like japanesse "-chan" they add in the end of the names
At least I hope they do it to cutify the name
Example:
"Ján" = "Janko"
"Tomáš" = "Tomáško"
Though, you can't use this (mostly, this language is full of rules that have zillion exceptions) on words that already end with the suffixes in their main form
Thx for reading till here
in Slovak , we have "guľomet" for machine gun, literally translates as bullet/ball thrower
Afaik, it's just some south-east Asian countries which prohibit them
Since our dishes are similar to yours
Its thebest food
I love sweet dishes with poppy
Mmm sulance s makom
Imagine being addicted to placebo
They use cute words for everything
No, it is literally a bottle with big pieces of fruits - [compote] But it sounds funny/cute in slovak, especially for a drug
We call shitty romance novels "red library" because of the common cover color
An especially dark joirnalism that goes out of its way to show misery is "black chronicle".
Can't think of any others
Fun fact: when journalists write about something that is not at all important, we call it "cucumber season". It means that there is nothing going on, so they have to write about cucumbers
Yeah, it is usually whenever the local equivalent of parliament is not in session
Sometimes there are some small cucumber seasons at other times, but that is not all that common
I remember exactly this from my grandma, but about a fly
A fly is sitting on the wall - Śedzi mucha na sceňe (in a dialect)
I would like to see what would happen of Czechoslovakia accepted Marshall plan and didn't 'vote' for commie takeover
Get ready for revolution movements then
We have been waiting to get out of there for centuries
1918 Czechoslovakia for the win
OK so what if we subtly assasinate him and blame it on soviets
Use their trick of 'suicide'. You know write a heart-felt confession how foreign soviet power is forcing him to go against CZSK best outcomes
I agree
It would be very interesting to see what would happen of they just let us be in 1968
To see how far can Prague spring go
Yep Democratic party has won in Slovakia
We were kinda bummed about the czech results
We have a few:
*Zbojník* - They were bandits that lived off the land and robbed people travelling through remote areas
They were known for their rebelous stance against nobility
*Bača* - Basically our version of cowboy/rancher
They lived alone or with helping force on *salaš* (sheep ranch), where they took care of their flock and produced many sheep cheese products
Theh still exist today, but are quite different than their old archetype version
I would say highwaymen, at least in Slovak folklore
Most famously Juraj Jánošík.
Well, since we were part of the Kingdom too, it also applies to Slovakia - Juraj Jánošík being the most famous one here and regarded as a national hero
ahaaa, so that is where word beťár is from

Afaik there is an EU wide law requiring restaurants to provide tap water for free
But you have to explicitly ask for tap water, if you ask for just “water” they are allowed to sell you bottled water

May I ask you what’s the difference between whisky and whiskey
Ugh, I can't believe I used to drink that in shots
Ah the young times
English is quite hard to learn due to the fact that writing does not correspond with pronounciation of the words so you have to learn those two things separately
I still have a problem with pronouncing some words wrongly simply because I pronounce some characters as they are written or sometimes I write a different word which is similar in its written form to a pronunciation of a word I'm actually supposed to write
Regarding grammar - I would say that one is of a medium difficulty
I saw much easier grammar rules (e.g. I found Chinese to have quite easy grammar rules, but I'm only really basic level in that so perhaps it would get harder later) but also more difficult ones
English was very hard for me when I started with it (around the age of 8) up to maybe age of 16-17
The reason might be because as a kid I didn't really put much effort into learning it and I only learned enough to pass exams
The huge break happened when I started with online gaming and watching English series (subtitled tho) around 15-17
So I would say exposure to the language helped a lot
That's also how the babies pick up the language naturally
And English has tons of content online to be exposed to so it's easy to also find an interesting content for yourself which is very important
E.g. it's also relatively easy to find a Chinese content but it's hard to follow it because their movies are often uninteresting for me or full of propaganda BS so it's hard for me to actually keep watching it regularely
English is the easiest language to study
Much easier than German, as it doesn't have the stupid (sorry) der, die, das for everything
I had to learn that from scratch
Oh, and don't mention French
That's the hardest language I have ever had to study, and I speak Hungarian
A guy from my high school (in Košice) started an MLM in Eastern Slovakia that is getting quite big

Also funny thing Austria - Hungary was Rakúsko -  Uhorsko but modern Hungary is Maďarsko

I've always found this amusing, since in Slovak "Dunaj" is the name of the river Danube and the city Wien is "Viedeň".
[wiktionary] says:  from Latin *Codania*, from Sinus Codanus (“the Baltic Sea”)
btw some different names in Hungary: Stoličný Belehrad, Ostrihom, Nové Mesto pod Šiatrom, Svätý Ondrej

I guess we do not really have a meme region
easterners joke about westerners and westerners about easterners and hungarians in the south
Or maybe the jokes about the Bratislava elite/café intellectuals
Oh, and about the Czechs that come to die in our mountains :D
Our parliament; most memes here are aimed at politicans
Yeah, but I don't care
I often joke about how terribly some Hungarians speak Slovak

I am kind of facing this question now, because of a boy obviously
And well its not going well for him
But heey he wants to come to Europe too, so we are kinf of leaning to half half
The only luck is that he lives in a democratic state
The other problem is, this state, famous, rich and all surprised me by having such a huge contrast between classes
Definitely not what I am used to
Plus I am soo terrified about this healthcare issue
Definitely would not want to start family there
The maternity leave is shitty, no normal holydays allowance, the fact you have to pay for having a baby, no additional help
Also even if we decide I am never ever willing to give us European schengen zone citizenship
Not a food, but Alcohol lol, like seriously we drink a lot
For me personally it's Chocolate or cake
Chocolate combined with alcohol is the ultimate combo lmao
Beer, best served with some sausage and fresh bread/buns/rolls
Can relate
Choco with alcohol would be a deadly combo for me
I generally don't like sweet stuff thaat much, but with alcohol it's another level, especially with beer
You might want to specify the alcohol part
But yeah, after the pandemic started and my workload increased with online classes, my beer consumption increased disgutingly
Oh Czech beer is fucking great, we drink it all the time in Slovakia
If you don't offer alcohol(often even several times) to a guest it's considered rude :D
We in Slovakia call Germany Nemecko (which, come to think of it now, also translates to land of the mute people)
We also call The Netherlands Holándsko, which translates to just the state of Holland, and not the entire Netherlands
Germany - Nemecko, Austria - Rakúsko, that's probably all, i don't really remember any other lol, but polish for example call Hungary Węgry and Italy Włochy, i never quite understood why they call them so weird, in slovak we would say 'od veci' xD
Nemecko-Germany
Not a country but, instead of **Venice**/**Venezia**, we say ***Benátky***. I'm from Slovakia and the same goes with Czech language
Possibly more slavic languages
And I have no idea where it came from - there is nothing I could find in the history of Venezia that goes by similar name
Mor Ho
(Kill them
Eagles flew from Tatra, heading for the plains,
over higher mountains, over even straights,
crossing Danube river, the broad water stream,
landed there beyond, Slavic descent rim
Roars the Danube, and moon after moon leave,
over it glows, strong castle on a high cliff
Underneath, the Roman – Emperor deploy his camps
in white shines wide and long rows of his tents
On the edge of camp, the Emperor on golden chair,
round him rulers guard, tough men, strong and fair
In front of the ruler, tiny maine stands,
each in shiny armor, champs of different lands
Whitty hair their necks are whipping
Blue eyes swiftly roundly swiping
Raised as fir tree, hard as stone,
looked all from one mother born
Gorgeous land – its borders washed by Danube strong,
And the rocky Tatra, like a wall runs round along
These lands, those proud mountain walls,
that´s their homeland, the cradle for sons of Slavs
Sent by Slavic tribe, from the famous council,
to deliver greetings, to emperor fearsome
They don´t harm their foreheads, nor falling to the knee,
don´t recognize such slavery in Slovak country
Gods gifts bringing with them, bread and salt to emperor,
and proudly talk to him, to the distant wanderer:
„Slovak nation, priesthood and elders of ours,
send their greetings to you, emperor famous
The land on which your foot want to step,
is ours, from thy God the Slavs did it get
Look: here the borders by the mighty Danube are washed,
there, the Tatra mountain as rocky wall is slashed
Its a blessed land, thank to Lord in heavens,
through the honest work, we starve never
We don´t lay, on what´s others, our hands,
Slav only own sow and reaps only own lands
But if on our door, in best intention stranger knocks,
whoever, from the table Gods gifts at him always looks
Cause the true, given by Gods to the Slavs is,
To have master is injustice, to be one even bigger is
This is the only poem we have to learn in school as far as I'm aware and is considered national poem

Ahh yes criminals not being able to vote is the same as a country with no human rights
It varies
Everyone just calls it "Svätá rímska ríša" = which is actually literal translation of Holy Roman Empire
But I just googled it and that's actually incorrect, and the correct way is "Rímsko-nemecká ríša" = Roman-Germanic Empire
Fascinatingly, without the Holy
tldr:
People say: Holy Roman Empire / Svätá rímska ríša
Correct way in our language: Roman-Germanic Empire / Rímsko-nemecká ríša (Without the Holy/Svätá!)
We usually call it the same, although someitmes we also say "Svätá rímska ríša národa nemeckého" - Holy Roman Empire of the German nation
I always talk about something in slovak and then forget the word but I know what it is in english and vice versa
Jozef Tiso
Not those you mentioned but far-right politics are at rise
It changed everything
We got our freedom, we got our first country we lived nice and happily, then were betrayed and given to nazis, then became East part of the wall then got some Russian tanks, then the regime fell, that caused lot of corruption in 90 because of the leftovers of the commie power greedily took the money
Then we joined EU and now we are better than ever
There are still people who try to pretend EU done nothing and I wish I cold punch them, because we are better than ever
Complaining is our national sport and everything is bad, but our GDP basically skyrocketed and standard of living is good
I even prefer to live here than when I lived in UK, I think we definitely have less contrast between classes (minus the Roma
) but ore racism and xenophobia basically because we were hardly ever exposed to the outside world, so no African immigration or any other really no one comes here

I can think only about Hungarian sounding / spelled names and surnames which indicates that the person is from the south of Slovakia
Oof it’s quite hard to say in Slovakia
But usually Hungarian sounding names (Andráši) or full on Hungarian ones (Bugár, Világi, Kovács, Andrássy, Katona) are from the south, where we’ve got the highest population of Hungarians
German ones are usually from the middle part or east, coming from towns that have a traditional German population from as far back as the Middle Ages
Slavic names are all over the place
Ukraine-sounding ones (Saskia) or orthodox christian ones are from the East
Polish sounding ones (Czerny) from the north, close to the border with Poland
Czech names are all over as we were one country before
The “most Slovak” names are found usually in the middle part of Slovakia and around the mountains
The capital is quite cosmopolitan in this regard
I answered a similar question some time ago:
>Not much, there are just certain features of surnames coming from the regional dialects which can give you a hint
Surnames from the west won't have Ľ, in the east you can find more ŠČ, DZ and DŽ. Some endings also reflects the dialects, like -lák in the west, -liak in the centre, -ľák in the east
>Apart from this, you can find Czech sounding -il /-al ending in the west, around Bratislava and Trnava Croatian sounding surnames are common (like -čič), in the very east some East Slavic (-in, -enko) too
Hungarian and German surnames are common all over the country
>Slovak surnames are also very diverse in general, in a group of 100 there's little chance there will be more people with the same surname unless they're a family (maybe twice Horváth or Kováč)
Are there any Ukrainian or Rusyn surnames that I'm unaware of
btw the meaning is "musician"

[Ikarus 280] All credit goes to Hungary, of course, but I just loved riding them when I was a kid
The four-part doors, the rubber joint, the noise, the sense of impending doom when driving downhill

You are like Tenet land, moving backwards in time, it seems
I remember when I was little I could go to the store with 100SK (about 3
3€) and I could walk out with a basket full of candy chips and ice cream
They still have the old Tatra trams in Pyongyang, you know
Sure, Karosas are also carved deeply into everyone's memory, but the Ikarus door were mesmerizing
Like, how could they even work
But in reality it's so Hungarian it can almost run on paprika
Did it count, when the ball hit the bottom bar
I prefer Ikarus 435 and 415 but this is very nostalgic

Yeah, totally, now that the world is shifting towards high-speed railways
It would be great to have a link along the Adriatic coast all the way to Tirana and maybe further down to Greece
Hopefully, at least the Adriatic highway construction won't stall
Yes
Also Tesco (with very long tradition), Billa, needless to say LIDL, and there were also Carrefour, Hypernova and even Marks & Spencer
I have never even visited
Although I would have this summer, if it wasn't for COVID
I just love travelling and when I don't have the money or freedom to travel in person, I finger travel on Google Earth and Wikipedia, checking out cities, airports and roads all over Europe
I think Honest Guide managed to show off Slovakia better than anyone from Slovakia that I've seen
I do like Czechia, the only think i would suggest would be for chechnya to get rid of green and yellow in their flag in favour of blue, to master this whole chechno-slovenia confusion
We say “česko” (Czechland
) in conversation but officially it’s “Česká Republika”
I love Czechia
I didnt know you have own writing system until now
I have learned a new thing, however having said that, it looks super chaotic (and reminds me a bit of thai), i wish i saw armenian handwriting/cursive, if there is such thing
How is this related
It is an english term, not protuguese one, in portugal you can call it Chéquie like brazilians, cant you
Why would you use english term in portuguese, you dont do that to other words
Czechia even in czech language sounds stupid, they call it "česko" or "čechy" (which funny enough is only a part of czech republic)
wow, you can use "ia" and "ija" in russian language, i have never thought of that
Are there many russian words with both cases
because here pretty much everything wit "ija" sound is written as "ia" "letter/phone" (because slovak unlike english or most languages really doesnt only have vowels and constants, but also "doublephones" like eastern slavic languages - ia, ie, iu, ô)
Fascinating that you, georgia and greece are so close together, yet have completely unique writing systems
And to the examples, like that - alphabet- it looks reasonable, what it looks like in text
For example i can read cyrilic (asbuka) but when i see handwritten text, it just get very overwhelming haha, it is just like someone is trying his new pen
It is pretty much the same thing over here with holand, i cant see how this is going to change
Netherland is being called "Holandsko" - the same as holand
But i cant imagine a change
They could call it "nizozemsko" (like in czechia hahaha), "dolnozemsko" or something similar, but it would make no sense using it further, the word for "people of netherland" would be some crazy nonsense
However having said that, this is about english language not about portuguese or slovak
Why stupid and wrong
I dont understand how is it different in this sense
I understand differences like "eu estou correndo" and "eu estou a correr", or those "sumo"-"suco", or "cao"-"cachorro", but i dont see how using Chéquie would be problem for portuguese speaking, other than being it a foreign word
Chzechia is an english word, transcribed to english
Because no one expects english speakers to use "česko". But your native language uses different phonetical rules from english
You obviously wouldnt use "Czechia" in portuguese, as it makes no sense
It is not even possible to write down in many languages
Thats because it is an english word, meant for english speakers
We also cant use some english words in slovak
If you learn english you have hard time to pronounce some english words because of different phonetics of course, but this is meant for english speakers
Forget about english, my question basically was, if there are russian words with sequence "иа" which would be pronounced as "ия". Because in slovak "ия" would be transcribed as "ija", but it is basically never written this way, it is always written as "ia" wich is alternative to russian "я" - as a letter
Naaah, most people over here cant read cyrillic, even those older ones who had russian at school haha
Also slovenia, croatia use latin, i think serbians use both to some degree
And funky, but much better then expected haha, i was expecting something like [this] or [this]
How is that related
You can call czech republic however you want in portuguese
But i just dont understand why you are trying to use portuguese pronunciationon english word
It cant work by definition
English has completely different rules for pronunciation
You obviously are not going use the term czechia in portuguese, why would you
It is an english term
Oh okay
Because in slovak you have words like "polícIA" which is pronounced as "polícIja" with "i" but then there are words like "hroIAci", pronounced as "horjaci" without "i".
In Slovak is jealousy "žiarlivosť" and envy is "závisť".
39 main dialects that are divided into village dialects (neighboring villages do not speak the same)
Not really
Bratislava is everything – all the big international companies have Slovak HQs here
Pretty large startup scene
That basically applies for the rest of Slovakia
In how many European languages can you say "thank you"?
I counted like 20 (PT, ES, FR, EN, IT, NL, DE, DK, SE, NO, PL, CZ, SK, HU, SI, HR, SR, UA, RU, GR, GE) and I am expecting most people to kick my ass
Slovakian, Russian, English, French, Hungarian, German, Dutch, Spanish, Italian, Serbian, Bosnian, Croat, Slovene, Polish,  Turkish
It's "madloba" in Georgian, "obrigado" in Portuguese and ~~"eucharistio"~~ "efharisto" in Greek, I believe
Just those I expect fewer people to know
Is this a bait
Hvala works for the whole former Yugoslavia, except for DPRM
Will you initiate us all into the first three
It's "hvala", from Ljubljana to Vranje
Why won't you make it a separate post
Errr
I haven't heard any merci in Hungary, only köszönöm.
You know Finnish, but you don't know German
Easy - in Yugoslavia, except for NM, it's hvala (NM - fala), in Polish it is dziękuję, which is exactly how Borat says thanks in his fake Kazakh and Czech and Slovak are similar (Děkuji [dyekuyi]/ďakujem [dyakuyem])
How different is it in Asturian compared to Castillan
You know Maltese though
It is easy to remember Polish "dziękuję", because it's what Borat says in his fake Kazakh
I bet you know that polandball strip where every countryball says "tak" and they all mean something different, right
If your name is Jim, beware, you should say "obrigad*o*".
Czech (děkuji) and Slovak (ďakujem) are little different
Very good in general, but you are assuming wrong
Ukraine is on the same team with western Slavs, with "dyakuyu" (PL: dziemkuyem, CZ: dyekuyi, SK: dyakuyem)
Both are used a lot
благосъстояние - welfare
Sorry, I only picked it from metro announcements
Let us summon a Hungarian
Tria
Maybe they use it less frequently, IDK
Still counts IMHO
I guess
It does resemble "obliged", doesn't it
I was surprised to learn it too
Oddly, I only heard it from the speaker, not read it
But it sounded to me, as I wrote
Maybe I am just used to the sound of the word "eucharistia" in Slovak, from Christian liturgy
I would consider to do if for In an out burger
However I would do it for Chipotle
And I would do two for Wasabi sushi and bento
If I get a lifetime supply
Cyanide
After the Great War, during the next war with Hungary, one of our generals had an idea to scare Hungarian soldiers and lower the morale
The idea was to make a few soldiers do blackface and go around villages and cities speaking gibberish, but often mentioning Senegal
Turns out it was successful and the Hungarians created the rumor of a 2000 african soldiers, hardened from the war in France, helping Czechoslovaks
Some abandoned their positions in fear of being "canibalized by the blacks", others due to the fear of being overwhelmed
The anthem of Yugoslavia "Hey slavs
" is overwritten song from Slovakia called "Hey Slovaks
". It was written as a response to forceful magyarization and was used as an official anthem by the Slovak State (Nazi puppet state)
And as you can imagine, it gained a reputation as a song used by neo-nazis and ultra-nationalist, which is shame, because I love it
Apparently Slovakia farms edible frogs but I haven't seen any anywhere
French do be buying weird stuff aye
Civ5 has that as a bonus with Maria Theresia (austria)
Just don't.
But La Marseillaise isn't about the city Marseille
I don't actually know why they adapted it
It is also used as a inter-slavic anthem, so maybe that's why
It wasn't. The text was written by studen of Štúr - Ján Matuška, and the music comes from Slovak folk song Kopala Studienku
Oh man, Slovaks would be strong contenders with ya
The cashiers are fast AF here but the number of working cashiers is around half compared to other shops so the queues are long eitherway
I haven’t yet seen a LIDL with more than 6 total cash registers
Mannnnnn, we have 65 political parties and most of them are weird
From those bigger ones in parliament
Probably the weirdest ones are neonazis, with politicians with literally tattoed auschwitz over their whole chest, or swastikas
Smer SD- they created most corrupted government, everyone knew that they were robbing the state but still managed somehow to win elections many times, this year they finally didn't,
ĽSNS - 'people's party our Slovakia' - they are nazi extremists, people vote them despite of this, and Sme rodina  -  We are family, their leader is a guy that has about 11 children with 10 different women or sth like that
Czechia has the pirate party in the government
Seriously
You are right
I thought they were in the government
I have always seen them in TV, this trio babiš, okaumra and the pirate guy
slovakia, any country smaller than us has to be really small, so i would consider as big the other xD
Vyhne
It's a small town near the city Banská Štiavnica, the town is in a  forest in a small valley
It's really beautiful
Yes great city, I have family here
Czech and Slovak (though i think more slovak, may be biased) are great too, its usually few youtubers that keep them going, the current meme that i dare say is our original is stokarske memes, basically horrible grammar and wordmaking and sometimes they use slang as well
Pretty strong on instagram, there has been a big boom recently and there are dozens of active pages
We even have our own kind of memes called "stokarske memes" (something like white trash memes) which embrace our alcoholic / gambling / drug culture and are generally written in poor language lots of grammatical mistakes
Some example can be seen here
Biology teachers in schools
It's not a separate subject, just a small part in biology class
Slovenia sends their wrongly adresed mail to us each month
Just crown Schwarzenberg already
Wasn't China also allowed
I feel like even in 200 years some people will still be like "Slovakia, oh you mean Czechoslovakia
i know that place" lol
I shudder at the thought
A batch of troops were late and everyone tought that they would come mid battle, but they didn't the Ottomans demolished us and then the king drowned while fleeing, thus throw Hungary into a three way Civil War (Hungary, Habsburgs, Ottomans) that lasted 163 years and then Hungary became a part of the Habsburg empire, wich led to their union in the late 19th century, wich led to them defending the Habsburgs in ww1
Or when we fought for freedom the Russians came to help the Habsburgs becouse of a union that was put in place, because of Napoleon
Yes, same happened to us
Of course not, we were merely a puppet, these kinds of things were decided in Moscow
The entire Eastern part
According to our previous PM, "There is nothing there".
If you don't want it just give the city to us
It's already Slovak anyway
Nope
I do it all the time
Sorts out the dinner
In USA i do it like 99% of time
The food portions are huge and I hate wasting food
They usually have a package option
Sometimes you pay like one euro for Styrofoam
I guess you don't do it in a Michelin star restaurants, but its not like I can afford those
Normal thing, but it does not happen often, people dont go to restaurant to eat up and leave, we go there to eat some, drink some, talk some and have a nice evening/noon/whatever part of the day but rarely breakfast
QWERTZ with additional buttons for ľ š č ť ž ý á í é ú ä ň ô (for the rest of the letters we need to use a combination of keys)
The keyboards are usually Czech-Slovak here, so there are two letters on some buttons for the respective languages
I'm so accustomed to QWERTZ that using QWERTY is a real pain for me
When being abroad I always find it hard to not answer "How are you
" greetings with how my day exactly is
In my home country, Slovakia, people tend to answer honestly
If the day was shit, they'll say so and explain why
If it was good, they'll say so and explain why
If it was average, they'll also say so and explain why
But abroad people expect you to say "I'm fine". Nothing more and nothing less, regardless of how you actually feel :D
Hungarian: Nagyon szép vagy drágám (You are very beautiful my dear)
Slovak: This is a bit more tricky due to sex differentiation
Si veľmi krásna/ý moja/môj drahá/ý (second words are for masculine)
Czech: Jsi velice krásná/ý má/múj drahá/ý.
I admit
a little bit :D
This is more a European vs Asian difference I'd say
Our mentality basically changed that people are tanned because they go on vacations while in Asia having pale skin means having a comfortable (and probably decently-paid) office job
People tend to become very pale when they're sick
It's not about where you're from, it's about how our body functions
There are quite a lot of dialects in Slovakia considering how small the country is
I’m not even sure how many there are but the main 3 ones are the western dialect, the mid-country dialect and the eastern dialect
I feel like they’re much more prominent in the countryside
If you live in any bigger ‘city’ you probably won’t speak in a very specific dialect
Mostly negative, accent and dialects don't have the prestige other countries like the UK has
Basically, if you speak any (slovak not foreign) accent (except for northern), it doesnt improve your image, and you are seen as "lower class". I dont know about posh, but the northern is like from fairytale, so it is seen as proper/oldschool/charming
As Slovak I understand someone from Ostrava better,than someone from Prague
Well, the dialects change from village to village or town to town, but they are similiar in west, east and mid
For instance I am from Spiš and have different dialect, than people from Abov or from Šariš. All those regions are in west of the country and for someone from outside are similiar or even same, but I can hear and see a lot of differences
No, there might be sometimes a reward offered for information leading to the arrest of wanted criminal (it's pretty rare tho), but you are supposed to give such info to the police which then handles the arrest
You aren't supposed to act on your own
Surprisingly, only 7
Rly
We have like 200 castles
At least our caves are included
Edit: they are not, apparently it's some shared caves with hungary
Somewhere
They didn't even put the biggest cave system there, with all year permafrost spanning several KMs underground
Shame on you UNESCO, you did us dirty
In Slovakia I know about 3 things that are disputed
If you eat schnitzel with rice or with potatoes
If you put meat into Christmas Sauerkraut soup or not
If Horalky (wafers with peanut spread filling) are better than Tatranky (hazelnut spread)
Yep, palacinka in Slovakia and palačinka in CZ
Notslovenia
And I would change Slovenia to Notslovakia, that way no one will confuse us anymore
And we call you Rakúsko after some small city [Raabs an der Thaya]
Exactly what i was thinking about my friend
What about something from my language
We call you Gruzínsko so Gruzia
That not bad
What about something from my language
We call you Gruzínsko so Gruzia
That not bad
And than some west Slavic guys:
[BENÁTKY ]
And the french got it from Vienna, not from Croatia directly
Yeah
But I was just confused, why is it so different and I found, you ministry of
Foreign affairs don't wanna be called Gruzia (or similar Slavic names) so for example Ukraine call you Sakartvelo
But it's haaaaard word for me
Definitely bullshit
It's not the East block in the 80's anymore, everyone have at least some kind of labeled clothing
I am not even counting band merch into that, which is also relatively common
People wear what they want
Most of my stuff does have some logo
I usually wear Adidas sneakers and backpacks, got Nike jacket and rest of the stuff are just the brands you never heard of, coz they are cheap
Yeah buying Adidas Sneakers for 65 € is the height of luxury for me lol
If WW3 starts we are between Ukraine and Western Europe
We are like Poland
So I have fear of Ukraine
Well you dont have to worry about that one anymore
We suck lately
Gone are the times when we got that bronze medal from you
Well, you'd be able to find people defending Orbán IRL in Slovakia as well, of all places
I don't know many Slovak Hungarians, but Slovak nationalists, alt-righters, and other right-wing extremists seem to have a boner for Orbán (his disdain towards immigrants, liberal democracy, the LGBTQ community, etc
The war of Charles I. against the highlords of Hungary (Matthew Csak, Amade Aba and the rest)
The Kingdom of Hungary had tonnes of castles, towns and such, so it would lend itself well to the AC open-world formula
You could also include the Adratic Sea/Balaton/Danube for ship gameplay too
For me it would be the 14th century, that's when our kingdom was the biggest
Matthew Csak
Matúš Čák.
Yes, especially on the Hungarian channels
There was even an uproar from the public once, when they wanted to skip airing it a certain year
It's a staple of both Hungarian and Slovak christmas
In Slovakia there's also Harry Potter
Every year they aired the newest part before christmas, and nowadays they air all of the movies during the weeks leading up to christmas
Other christmas movies are of course, old Czechoslovak and Slovak movies like Kurvahosigutntag, Mrazik (Frost father
), Vrchni prchni, Jak vytrhnout velrybe stolicku (these are mostly czech comedies, I love them) and so on (like Fantaghiro or other old foreign live action fairy tales, czechs and slovaks love those)
'Sedláci' or 'sedlač'.
With Czech it's like 97% inteligible
Polish barely anything, Russian a few words and others probably nothing
I agree
[Hanging by the rib] using hook
Beheading was also popular, and in 20th century hanging and shooting squads (popular during ww2)
Communists liked hanging, last execution took place in Bratislava in 1989
Good ol' hanging by the neck or piercing a hook through the ribs
I looked it up and it's terrifying that it was still used in 1974
came here for the hook&rib
Sponsored by the "slipped on peas" gang
Shame, shame, shame, shame
By default, education is in Slovak only, but it is not a requirement at all levels
There are exceptions; Hungarian minority have schools that are bi-lingual, some courses in Hungarian, some in Slovak
You then also have some high-schools that are bi-lingual by choice, usually English, French, German or Spanish as the 2nd language
Universities are Slovak primarily, but you can opt in to take some degrees in some unis in English, but this usually carries a paid tuition, unlike the free Slovak option
Then, you also have plenty of private schools that are often uni-lingual with a foreign language only
None at all
The Hungarians in the south are satisfied with their position, a lot of Romas live from welfare, so they need the government, we barely know Rusyns exist except of knowing them personally or remembering they celebrate the major holidays later than we are
Yes us hungarians want to separate from slovakia
Ok, you can just stop flexing, ok
In my region we have this unspoken rule that we call different grandparents a different synonym for grandma and grandpa
Father's side - babka, dedko
Mother's side - starenka, stareček
Both are also used as in "generic old person" and outside our region people use these pair but don't adhere to this rule
Also a way to distinguish, I heard of children who have one pair of grandparents that speak Hungarian call them by the Hungarian name for grandma and grandpa
The grandparents are often bilingual but they want to differentiate them so
In slovak a dragon is "drak" but funny enough the paper kite kids fly in autumn we call "šarkan". This way we can differentiate them
Although children today call a kite "drak" too, since most of them look like one and the word šarkan is becoming (if it's not already) archaic, because it's too specific and foreign sounding
Spelling reforms are for pussies, let's write like they did in the middle ages when people had no idea how to write shit so they just made it all up
Strange, I though slavic languages used *mesiac* for both
Though I heard about *Lunochod* witch should have been a hint
. .
This way you can talk to your dentist while he's operating on you, cool
We would use *polmesiac* for crescent, as in half moon
(Though I know it isn't really half moon :)
Nope, only derivates borrowed from other languages (lunárny modul, lunochod, lunárny kalendár) not the word luna itself
I've literally never heard someone say "polmesiac" other than in the context of the Turkish flag or Islam as a whole
I identify with myself, then the world, then the EU, then my city, then my region and I don’t identify with my country at all
Nationalism is only good as an excuse for war
Borders are purely political bullshit that was mostly argued hundreds if not thousands of years ago
I’m from southwestern Slovakia and our culture and geography is much closer to neighboring regions in Hungary and Czechia than to northeastern Slovakia
Also I see no reason why I should be proud of the place just cause I was born in it
I wish people would just stop arguing about pointless borders and cultural disputes and just started accepting each other and strive together for technological and societal progress
Hmmm mostly playing footbal, hockey (or rather hockeyball), and climbing -  trees, buildings, rocks
Also we were making bows and arrows with our knives and shooting around, also making those balloon guns and shoot rowan around, also those kinder surprise grenades
Rural is better when you try to connect it to a different word…like juror
So you get Rural Juror
OK hear me out
Taiwan
Yes it is an island, i get that, but look at their history and then at the history of Slovakia
So many of instances of similarities
The brush with communism
Them being on mercy of foreign powers
In 40ties overtaken by the axis powers
The martial law, the censorship, the fall of communism and the consecutive democratisation
Also China is their Russia
So basically I feels strangely connected to countries in Asia who had brush with commies
Similarly a bit with Vietnam
And a bit with Korea, but I feel like thats a German territory there, before they got the east Germany back
this and progressive presidents
Probably [Sandberg] in Bratislava, which was a sea bottom/shore in the prehistoric times (millions of years ago), when Europe was under the sea
You can easily find fossils of shells there
It was discovered during mining operations, I used to play as a kid there
The area is protected now, also because of the unique flora and fauna, so one should be careful there
Strangely, there is no English Wikipedia article on this
There's a village called Panické Dravce which can mean
* *panic predators*
* *male virgin predators*
We also have a villages called **Horný Bar**, *Don'tBeScared* (Nebojsa) or *Naked Man* (Naháč)
I know that there's a city in Czechia called "Pičín" which is very roughly translated as Pussyville
There is a village in poland called "kokot", which is the most vulgar term for cock in slovak language
And it is doubly funny because it is in poland
In prague there is a park called "židovské pece" which means "jew furnaces"
Well I remember that
What the hell was that guy thinking
Better let that train crash into me than drive and away
Ah, Ljubljana is a beautiful city
I loved Prague when I visited it, Czechoslovakia
So you had war in 90's, right
Jokes aside, it really depends, usually people do not have any opinion as they do not have many info about my country, altough it is getting better and more people visited it
I do not understand only when our neighbourghs do not know anything about us, that is weird
How is popular teleshopping in your country
Do you trust teleshopping
In Slovakia our seniors like very much teleshopping
Younger people calling teleshopping scam
How about your country
Happy cake day
Same here delimano and dormeo
Non so perché ho guardato l'intero video
Yes many teleshoppings here are translated from english and clips are from US
[I guess this one
It was taken by Ladislav Bielik in Bratislava, August 1968
Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia
except of romance languages, which are all beautiful i find nice swedish and i don't know why also basque - i am just fascinated when i hear those two languages lol
You got some traveling
Throughout our history, quite often, especially while being under Hungary or Austria-Hungary
Then how can he be a PM If he is technically a foreigner
He's also very much against migration
He defends himself by saying that his mum was born in Moravia
Not sure how that helps him
what is bad about Russian vaccine ? I thought thaht our common goal was to save lives and end this outbreak , but also in Slovakia governmnet is at risk of breakup because of disagreemnt with aquiring Sputnik ...
Full agree on the chinese one ....i think that Russia wants to ide this vaccine as showing "the west" how cutting edge they are , so i think IT will be good ...(like i heard that Moderna or Astra not sure, Has pretty Bad side effects but is allowed ) so i think that its mainly the extremly rusophobic politicians that want to block it
Accidentally the most effective teacher you could have
Not gonna forget it if you had to fact-check it
>"Hoj mor ho
detvo môjho rodu, kto kradmou rukou siahne na tvoju slobodu"
(The poem uses some unique archaic words that I can't translate 1:1, but I will do my best)
Strike Him, offspring of my blood, him whose hand would steal your freedom
It is from the poem Mor ho
- a poem about a fictional event where a roman "czar" sets out to conquer pannonia
The local slavs send a delegation of young warriors who tell him that he is welcome to the land, but if he tries to conquer it, he will regret it dearly
The "czar" of course tells them to surrender, so the warriors, bellowing the battle cry "mor ho
" attack him
The "czar's" soldiers defend him, and cut down all the youths, but only at a great cost
The poem reflects the Slovak fight for freedom, that at the time (1864) still seemed futile
Slovakian author Andrej Sladkovic:, poem Marina;
"Dear motherland I want to love in beautiful Marina,
Dear Marina, whom I love in wonderful fatherland,
Embracing them both in one being"
It was about embracing love to your country and to a woman at the same time
Romanticism, 19th century
To his memorial, we built a "bank of love" in the most picturesque town in Slovakia, Banska Stiavnica, where couples come to celebrate their love
Haha, no one outside ever makes a nice accurate film about Slovakia
The only only foreigners who ever portrayed us nicely are Czechs, and thats because they love Tatras and like to sometimes shoot romantic films there
Plus they are not really foreigners
Also I have seen a Japanese dorama that used a National theatre in Bratislava for few scenes, but I think they pretended it was Prague
Are there any movies that portray anything well
Scripted movies favor stereotypes to reinforce their narrative, this especially applies for portraying foreign countries
Freaking love that film
Its one of the best films ever
Made me super sad to
Thanks for reminding me, gotta rewatch
But you *are* exactly somewhere in between those first two, aren't you
So how do you like Mamma Mia
Well at least they often make them look sexi
Cinema verite films usually do
And when someone who lives there makes a great film
Starting a fight
Seriously
Usually drunk british tourists start fights
just dont do it
Not only because it is wrong itself, but many people in slovakia know how to fight or carry some sort of weapon with them (tear gas, boxer, baton, knife
) and once it gets into an actual fight it can get pretty nasty
Just dont do that, enjoy your beer, food etc
dont cause such problems - to locals and also to yourself
Go hiking in flip flops
There is nothing manly about this behaviour
I used to box (like the sport) and still dont understand that the same way that all the boxers from the gym just didnt get it
I think those are just frustrated people and for many of them this is the only way to make other human being to touch them
I don't know anyone who carries a pepper spray or a knife
Maybe op runs with a wild crew
I mean the first time I have seen bar fight was when I studied in UK and it was wow like in the films
And I used to hangout with metal heads in high school
But to be fair no one really likes drunk noisy violent British tourists
Tbh, he's exaggerating a bit with this piece of info
There are just some places where fellow drunken Slovaks (the Macho, kinda extremist type) usually attend and can be equally as annoying
They also tend to start fights and encountering a foreigner with the same attitude won't and don't end up well
So yeah, just like anywhere else, when you tend to get wasted, just don't pick the wrong person to fight with :D
Other than that, it's pretty safe
Slovakia is pretty safe country in general
That was not my point
But fighting sports are quite popular over here, many people do boxing, muay thai, mma etc
as a hobby
There is still this macho mentality in the country even tough now it is more about minority, but you can easily find a person who knows how to protect himself
Possession of cold weapons (pepper spray, knife, baton, boxer, gas pistol etc
) is completely legal in slovakia, and also (despite what even many slovaks think), the self defense law plays in favour of the victim (like one year ago two drunk guys wanted to attack an indian guy, he stabbed one in the neck and this one died, the indian guy wasnt prosecuted because of act of self defense)
There are some places where there is still this macho culture pretty alive, but honestly as a tourist you are most likely not going to get there
People in bigger cities still carry weapons (not all of them of course, but way much more than in UK for example)
I tried to search for an incident like that what i remember but i cant find it, it happened few years ago in bratislava, where some group of drunk british tourists attacked a couple and the guy stabbed two of them
But honetsly it is hit or miss, most of the time if you as a foreigner try to attack people, people would go away - as they dont want to get involved in violence, even if they carry a weapon or know how to fight - because people dont want to end their night with a fight (especially in bigger cities)
But once you find similar person, it can get nasty
If i am not mistaken, carrying a weapon is illegal in UK
Czech tourists and hiking in sandals, name better duo
thats what you get after splitting from Czechoslovenia
I think this may be a bit your experience but I personally don't know anyone who carries weapons as that
Or ever seen a bar fight
I like beer as every slovak and walked home drunk alone many times
Maybe if you mean neonazi groups but those are everywhere in Europe
It's like copy paste macho guys
Also British, but especially some from London and Glasgow are pretty proficient in stabbing
Seriously
What about Obchodná in bratislava, there is a fight almost every weekend, sometimes multiple ones
Are those all neonazis
And yes, glasgow and london have stabbings, but how is it relevant
Thats why carrying a weapon is illegal
Here we are in opposite situation (thank god) where street crime is getting better and better year by year
Maybe our criminals go to UK :D. But seriously, i see a different problem in UK: Here in slovakia police can just stop you and search you, and once they find something you shouldnt have, you go to jail
In uk knifes are illegal per se, but police can do pretty much nothing about it, because everyone ha so many rights
Also here if something goes down, police shoot (they even carry an attack rifle in their car if i am not mistaken), in UK they can blow their whistle and pray for the best
Sorry, I just haven't had experience with it
I take the night bus from the Hodžko and its okay
But I am also not a club person anymore maybe KC Dunaj from time to time, but that's not really a club, I go to a better looking pubs
The only place we go to at Obchodná is Slovak pub
I don't really have any friends who look out for the fights or even been in one
Also if there is so many fights and after the shooting fiasco, good riddance on increased police presence there
Also the football fight was shitty time, those people who fought there were bastards
I just want a common European Army already so that they can all get out
besides that i find it outrageous
This is purely my opinion,
Pizza, Pasta in general - spagetti, tagliatelle
Cheese, salami, ham
Any kind of bread and also any baking
Sweets - butter biscuits, chocolate
All food is better in Europe duh, them food regulations are hardcore here
Than question would be what is better in France than anywhere else in the world
Kinda misunderstood question
Hmmm, I do not know about that if we have good duck meat or chicken meat, because I am so used to it
Hehe
But still what do I love eat with duck is this:
It is duck with potato dough (also called slovak potato flatbread) with red cabbage
So, if you sit somewhere in US and wants to order Spagetti, Lasagne, Ravioli, Rigatoni, Tortellini, Linguine, Penne, Pappardelle, Elbows, Farfalle
It would taste better in Europe
Pasta has place of origin in Italy
Asia in general do not make pasta, they make noodles, taste and serving is different as well
So you can not really compare them
If question would be who has best noodles, then you can run vote chart for Japan, China, Indonesia, India
It does exist in North Africa, Middle East - but, how can you know it is not imported from Italy, or they made their own recipes, even if they call it pasta, it is waaaay away from true pasta taste (yeah I tasted it) that has a centuries of long history in Italy
Nope
But polish products can be found in the shops
Mostly sweets
And krowky
Prussia and Germany overall before the world wars
1896 hungary had a year long parade celebrating  the honfoglalás (coming into europe)
I would like to go back to 1896
Millenium celebration
I don’t watch sport a lot so I don’t really know that many
I only recognize the UK and Germany’s anthem
I do know the American and Canadian tho
But I guess I definitely need to check out other European anthems
Anthems are my guilty pleasure and I also like to learn different languages so that is why I know quite a lot of them
I know the melody and lyrics of these:
Slovak (I am Slovak)
Czech
Polish
Soviet (i know only the begining of russian)
Italian
German
English
Scottish
South African (my favourite)
Israeli
American
French
Canadian
I can also recognize all european anthems and anthems of big countries
There is just something really appealing in anthems, haha
As a young Slovak, I can sing Czech anthem because they beat us awfully lot at Football and Ice hockey
Although my parents remember it from Czechoslovakia times, they don't watch sports
Then I can sing God Save The Queen, from my English class
Also I can hum Deutschlandlied from my German class
Far eastern Slovaks, from Zemplín, never could understand them
It's Slovak, but Polish and Ukrainian at the same time
Central Slovaks understand them better, probably, but for people on the other side of the country
no way
If you include minority languages of the same language group, then Rusyns and Gorals are just slightly less intelligible than Eastern Slovaks
But honestly, you still understand more than when you hear Hungarians speaking Slovak
jk :)
It's not slang
They're dialects
Slang is used by subcultures, dialects by ethnic groups and subgroups, calling them slang is pretty disparaging to the cultural and linguistic value they have
And my god, I love them
Central Moravian dialects are the prettiest Slavic languages/dialects ever
The long vowel endings
hell yeah
I am from the West and I understand Polish more than Eastern dialects, lol
But if they speak proper slovak with just accent, it is understandable but a bit annoying as the accent is totally the other way around and the dynamic is different
And Hungarian accent is cute and funny, not that annoying to me
Are you assuming New Frenchmen (and women of course) aren't from France
That's pretty problematic
I'm from the northwest, that's why I dislike the accent :D
Come definiresti il linguaggio che si parla a Roma
Lo capiscono tutti, per esempio nella serie Suburra
Yeah, I mean, even in Slovakia, you'll find every village in the mountains to have a sightly different dialect
But they become wildly different only after you enter another cultural area
Everything is French if you want it to be
I wasn't being serious ;)
Nowadays, mostly December-February in the lowlands, although brine is all that's left of it by noon
I Slovak we use commas as decimal seperators and spaces for thousands:
1 201,55€
why is your country Prague
Exactly the same everywhere except for the Anglosphere
The Anglosphere at it again
Slovakia: caputová Kofola
Hungary: everything
In Slovak, we pronounce it with Sh and also the original pronunciation in Hungarian is with Sh
However, it doesn’t mean that pronouncing it with S in another language is wrong
For example I say Londýn, italians say Londra and spanish say Londres
None of us say London
That doesn’t mean that those pronunciations in the other languages are wrong
Budapešť, so soft s (š - sh) and soft t (ť - I don't really know how to write it phonetically)
The real question is if you pronounce it with t or ť.
> ť - I don't really know how to write it phonetically
There really isn't an option for that in English
The closest you can go to explain the sound is to read tya and the sound the t makes in that combination
It's like explaining w to a Slovak where that sound only really exists as a part of ô /wo/.
Just say voiceless palatal plosive, it's the same everywhere
> but I think that 'correct' pronunciation in English is with s, so I usually go with that
Well, then you're wrong
It's as easy as that

I spent years trying to learn it in school, but always saw it as being in competition with English as the foreign language I excel at, so I grew to despise it as a child
I was a dumb 11 year old, no clue why I created that binary in my head
I’d love to be fluent, the language is cool, I do enjoy the grammar for the most part, and it’s useful in Europe
French
I have never even tried learning French
I adore French baking, make a bunch if entremets and tarts
I’d love to speak it so I can go on a vacation through French countryside and enjoy myself without a language barrier
Cantonese
Because I adore Hong Kong and it’s far more difficult than even Mandarin
I usually go by UN languages
So need to finish my French
That makes three
But I would like to choose some more unusual language
For example Japanese, or Swahili can get you some really nice translation jobs
Especially anywhere with Japanese company in Europe as their language proficiency with European languages is usually ehm lower
Sorry guys
But Japanese companies in europe make great use of their translators
Especially if its something as German, Japanese and English combo
Or french combo
I still think that Slovak, closely followed by Czech, has the best ortography for Slavic languages
Clearly, I’m partial to it as a Slovak speaker, but it being almost entirely phonetic (the whole phonetic thing got ruined by the introduction of “y” which sounds just like “i”) is nice
And we have single characters for a bunch of common sounds that other Slavic languages use multiple characters to express - ž, č, š, ď, ť, ň, ľ, á, é, í, ó, ú, ô, ĺ, ŕ.
Whenever I see latinized Ukrainian, I wish they just used our alphabet
It can handle the sounds better than any other
In Slovakia a lot of them got removed (those of Soviet politicians), and streets and schools got renamed
I say keeping the monuments to fallen Soviet soldiers makes sense, since they sacrificed themselves to free us from the Germans, but statues, plaques or anything praising people like Stalin, Brezhnyev and so should be removed
Agreed
All the monuments make sense and I am totally for keeping them
Any place can be used for propaganda if You want to, but memorials are a thing that should be kept to remind people of the past
"Step closer to the urinal
Every officer is armed with handgun, and there is one assault rifle in all patrol cars - this rule was established after 2010 shooting in Bratislava, where officers with handguns couldn't stop active shooter armed with military grade VZ58 assault rifle
However, officers don't carry it outside unless really necessary
Sometimes, during high-activity events (like Christmas markets), there are officers with assault rifles or even fully geared solders walking around
Police without guns are more uncommon than the armed ones
Every cop has a handgun here, except riot police of course, they have other means of crowd control at their disposal
I was in Prague few years back, and I remember being surprised when I saw police armed with assault rifles at Masarykovo nádraží. However, I haven't seen armed officers anywhere else in Prague
Same in Slovakia
Same in Slovakia
Depends on if it’s in a restaurant or at home
When it’s at home, we usually host family gatherings at our weekend house so we sit outside, prepare some food - often barbecue
And we just sit and talk and drink
I usually spend the time playing board games with my cousins tho bc I don’t feel like I quite fit in with the grown ups yet (thank god most of my cousins are my age)
And if it’s in a restaurant, than it’s basically the same but we obviously don’t prepare the food ourselves and we don’t play games so it’s usually more formal

How could OP forget the most important person in history
Smh my head
I would say for people interested in history, yes he is, but in the general public, probably not so much
This case is like Nikola Tesla 2: Literature Boogaloo
Well I don't like it
We get them a lot in Bratislava on Saturdays, Fridays and it can get wild
I am not really into drunk groups of guys shouting at me as I walk home
As if they think I don't understand them
We also get lot of Austrian, German tourists that come here for that
I don't mind them being on holidays but can they act a little bit better or something
Not jumping into fountains, not shouting at girls
I really do
I do kind of hate my native language because of its complicated grammar and some inconsistencies
I probably make many many many errors while writing in English and double that for speaking, but it still feels better and more consistent
Why would it be scary
>  Like if I say something like "I was walking down the street and I saw a yellow bus with an antenna on it" would that become "I was walking down street and saw yellow bus with antenna" (after writing that out that's kinda how we speak when we do eastern European impersonations)
Well, yes
In Slovak, we do have equivalents of words "some/any" and "this/that/these/those" which are sometimes used in place of your indefinite and definite articles, respectivelly, but usually (I'd guess 70 to 80% of times), there's just no equivalent word there
Us Slavs (apart from the Bulgarian and Macedonian traitors) don't have articles, so it's usually pretty difficult to use something in place of nothing
"If there is not going to be the motorway bratislava-košice in 2010, i will leave politics" - Rober Fico, former slovak prime minister - still in parliament, even though his party is not in government (since last month after 12 years)
Trump is at least very transparent about his wall :D
Classic
Always makes me laugh
Yes, i forgot to write this, of course it is still not done, not even close
It is being build since 70s, it is becoming more of a legend than a real deal
Slovak version of Sagrada Familia
Won't even be finished in 2120
I think very well know
She is from one of the richest families (mafia/oligarchs), shes killed people in car accident - twice, etc
In my view, thats way better scenario than in germany
I am still very confused about the berlin wall, that has to be nuts to see how army just split your city out of nowhere, and it was like 20 years after the war, not immediately
Eastern germany
Obviously the talk about motorway was trough northern slovakia
She hit some people years before this incident in košice, but at that time her family was "untouchable". Even the incident in Hungary spread a of passion in slovakia about slovak "privileged" ones
People were genuinely surprised when she had to go to jail
No one expected that
People thought she will get out of it with their connections in hungary
It is similar (although not the same) here, crossing the border to austria just sitting in nice train and thinking how few years back you would got shot to your back for just thinking of it
How weird it had to be to watch those people on the other side, who were so close yet so far away
As far as i know (i may be wrong), our motorway was proposed to be built in the 70s, funny enough it was supposed to be built by japanese, in exchange for some processing waste from our industry we could not reuse, yet they had the technology
And it was being stopped by USSR, because no imperialistic japanese would harm beautiful socialistic czechoslovakia
And that was pretty much the beginning of this legendary project
Is the airport still under construction
I think that the public opinion on this case in slovakia might be even stronger because of who she is
Because those people act like everything belongs to them
If it was some random slovak person, it wouldnt bring so much attention
Those people are disgrace of our society
Many of them should have been already in jail, even before such incidents
I have literally family members living in Hungary and Austria,, and working in slovakia, they drive every day to bratislava
Both my siblings live in czechia, and also i have many slovak friends living in poland,  austria, germany, switzerland, denmark, nederland, estonia, croatia, spain
And even the language barrier is fading away with youth speaking reasonably good english pretty much everywhere in europe
Some people in slovakia dont understand how convenient it is
For those i suggest to cross slovak-urainian border
It just struggles you how things are different now
It was interesting
People were genuinely surprised that such news even got out in Hungary
Probably police just didnt know who she is etc
or didnt believe her because she was drunk etc
because i am pretty sure she could just buy out hungarian police on the spot (to some degree), people were actually pleasantly surprised, when she went into jail and didnt manage to just get out with probation or something like that
Because her family was stupidly rich with very strong connection, and even that they lose a lot of power, they are still quite powerful
Even to this day
We have a castle [Likava] Well more like a ruin

kladivo in Slovak -I feel like the 3 syllables somewhat take the punch away
there's a historic word for smith's hammer, perlík, I don't think it's widely used anymore, and some regional dialects use(d) the Polish loan words mlat and mlatek, and German loan word hámrik used for a small hammer
none of those sound too hammery to me tbh
kladivo
it is pronounced like kla -as clarity
di as divine
vo as voice
Renting a place at 25 is lesa common here than U.S. But what I heard from my age group who are renting, it's very poor in terms of savings
Nice, what would you say is there average salary most people live off in Slovenia
And what are the cost of living
Here in Slovakia if you are in smaller city expect to pay around 300-400€ rent + energies for 3 room flat around 64m and make from 600 to 1000 depending on the field
In Bratislava you would pay around 3000 for a studio around 30-40 m but you d make around 1000 and more also depending on the field you are working in
Prices are after tax
Wow not only we share similar name and flag but also living conditions, I might move to Slovenia for that sea access I miss a lot in Slovakia
You and UK
I have never ever been in such a cold damp houses
Me and my roommate we literally wore jackets inside
Or we used to gather in kitchen because it was smaller and heated easily
First thing my erasmus friends usually did was to buy a heater
Getting out of the bed in the morning was an effort
Italians generally complain a lot about your country
But the truth is, we do like you a lot
1) Yes, im movies
2) No
I kind of do not see the sense in that
I have heard about it, but it's not a thing here since for the most part the spelling is consistent (most part, not always, there are features that make spelling harder, but it's not like the conventional spelling English has)
Bratislava- liberal youth, Asian immigrants (usually Vietnamese and Chinese) owning either an ethnic restaurant or a shop with very cheap products, junkies who usually gather in Pentagon, very snobbish people, rich gold diggers obssesser with plastic surgeries, hipsters, horrible traffic
Nitra- hockey-obssessed drunkards, farmers, poor Gypsies, metalheads & rockers
Southern regions and regions close to the Hungarian border- Hungarian farmers who sell fruits and vegetables at open-air markets for living, people tend to speak broken Slovak with Hungarian accent
Central regions- folk-oriented and sheep-fucking rednecks with funny accents, former neo-Nazis, very religious, a lot of caves and forests
Northern regions- mountains, forests, bears eating trash, Gypsies, unofficial graveyard of Czech and Polish tourists, people often vote for neo-Nazis, drunk shepherds carrying long [axes]
Eastern regions- poverty, Gypsies, crazy and uneducated drunkards, very weird dialects and accents
Also:
Dunajska Streda or Dubajska Streda as in the home of Docasny Slovaks (Temporary Slovaks) and it's region: a country within a country, where there are billboards in Hungarian and most of the events and other stuff is in Hungarian
Don't expect the people there to understand Slovak
Also lots of former maffia members, tax dodgers and stuck up people with fancy cars
Trnava - hard accents, hate Hungarians and they take football too seriously
Kosice - Bratislava of the east, home of the Lunik IX district (gypsy capital) but also of the famous Mojsejovci family (something like the Geissens or Trumps)
Petrzalka - city within a city, the Brooklyn of Bratislava with commie blocks, drug users
Burgenland and Niederosterreich - slowly being absorbed by Slovaks and Hungarians (really, a lot of people move and work there)
Rajka - the new district of Bratislava (sorry Hungary, never meant to offend you)
Pre-pandemic, it was like traveling just to another town in the same country
My mom lives in Austria, my exgf in Hungary, and when I came to a visit, I picked up my gf and went to mom's place, crossing border twice and being in 3 different countries in time span of 30 minutes
Lot of people also live in one country and commute to work/school in another
It's totally cassual, people nowdays seem to completly disregard borders, like they don't even exist
I still don't expect them here
Those are pretty much all over Turkey, Arabic countries and South East asia
I have seen those in Slovakia, in "commieblock" apartments
But definitely not common
At least something you can say is "free and public" in U.S.
How often do your hear people justifying their choice in election by the argument, that at least it is not the other candidate in the first place
Assuming there are only two individuals, or two major political parties/coalitions
Basically the only reason our current government has been elected is because they weren't SMER or ĽSNS
Yes, I suppose there is *that* political party, fed by hate of some few people and hated by the rest, in every country
Hmm, is there a communist party in Portugal
I wonder how Portugal would have looked like, had it been a part of the eastern bloc
How come despite the way the government handled the crisis (especially the first wave), PSOE still keeps being the biggest party at least according to the election polls
In Slovakia our prime minister's party has already fallen off a cliff (from 25 to 15%) and our situation hasn't even been that bad in comparison to many EU countries
I'm sad for both of you
" Some people will fly trough the small roads" ...  "at 60 km/h" heh I mean yeah thats pretty flying trough, if you are looking at it from the train going the same speed and opposite direction
People here drive faster than that on curbs/bicycle lanes
Everybody should drive depending on their driving skill
If you know how to drive fast, and dont care about the potentional fine, drive like that
If you are a new driver dont endanger people around you and drive safely
This rule apply most of the time, so there are plenty of people going 130 on a 70km/h road that can barely fit two cars, and same ammount of people who go 90km/h on a highway
Short answer: yes
Longer answer: yeees
In depth answer: There is a culture in Slovakia about hating your job
It doesn't matter what it is, you need to bitch about it at least a little bit
Unpaid overtime does not exist in here
Paid overtime is paid too well (state mandated) to be broadly affordable for employers
Your shifts ends at 16:30
That means 16:29 you are waiting to sign off and go home
Also not sure if the whole Slovakia does that or just my gymnasium, but each year after their pre-graduation party the soon-to-be graduates would walk around school and go into other classes, sing Gaudeamus Igitur and throw candies
Smaller kids loved it
Brno feels probably the most foreign for students
It’s very weird when you hear Czech there sometimes
But the most foreign feeling at home
probably Dunajská Streda or Komarno, because the majority of the speakers don’t speak  Slovak or they don’t speak or well, so when you go there as a Slovak you’re often looked at as If you were an alien
As for most familiar that would be all Slovak cities probably because they all look alike
Most of Slovak cities and towns feel very similar to each other
For example [Banská Bystrica] just because it's in the very centre
I've just remember Svit, a town built as a workers' colony for [Baťa shoe factory] Not too foreign, but [the style of houses in not common here] (even though the "sun rays" style fences scream THIS IS SLOVAKIA)
No issues I’ll gladly explain
The group doesn’t only speak the minority language, they do speak Slovak but these towns vastly prefer to speak Hungarian
We have some pretty great minority laws, which guarantee them the same status as Slovak in towns where the majority population is Hungarian or etc, so they can have official communication/schools and such in their language
So yes, the central government does make the effort to do that
Yes, of course, it's just that Partizánske has outgrown the original "Bata town" significantly, so I picked Svit
Best video ever, no joke
You conveniently left out your beyond ridiculous number pronunciation system

There is a band from Russia that sings in finnish precisely because noone can understand that
They are called Kauan, they are pretty cool
I think " stvrdnúť " (to get hard) is the most extreme example, at least based on my personal research
Electing Vladimír Mečiar in 1990s. Even today some scandals are echos of a situation he created
Ehmmmm
Same here
I had lived in Helsinki as a teenager before I moved back to CE
Back then, as a teen, I did not really have any issues and coped with it perfectly, same went for the long summer days
I visited Helsinki 2 years ago as a tourist during the summer, now being an adult I completely struggled with the summer night
At one moment, I felt completely tired and sleepy, confused why as the sun was still high up, but then it made sense looking at the watch as it was close to midnight
Then, you want to sleep, but somehow you can't completely shade out the sun in your hotel room and you just struggle sleeping, because outside it looks like its still day
I then opened the minibar and started drinking
Just 48 degrees, but we usually deal with it by turning on light
Here the sun sets down at 3 (behind the mountians), i i do not like it very much
I honestly have big problem with winters, all this cold weather, being dressed like an astronaut, always dark
it just doesnt work for me personally
I gotta agree
What the fuck is Hungary
What infrequented word from a foreign language, that you barely speak, have you impressed a native with
I surprised an Italian in a bar once, by knowing what "cieco" meant (blind, a homophone with Czech), as he wanted to tell me about the Italian dad joke ("I met a blind man
"/"Are you sure he wasn't Slovak
"), which I had picked from Reddit
Also, even though my German is so poor that even when I order food in restaurants, and I make myself clear that I'm just trying practice it a little bit if they kindly let me to do so, waiters better switch to English, I remember an English conversation with a German, when I wasn't so sure about the English word for a health insurance card and from a spot deep, deep in my mind, I pulled out the word "Krankenversicherungskarte", which blew his mind, and so did mine, to be honest
At one point, I could recite the Revelation of St
John in Swedish ("Och när Lammet bröt det sjunde inseglet, uppstod i himmelen en tystnad som varade vid pass en halv timme
") because of a monologue from the Bergman's film The Seventh Seal, which sounds pretty cool, but I forgot most of it
Igor Matovič (Slovak PM) posted on his Facebook recently, that he had met Merkel in Brussels and she had been able to tell him "Ďakujem za kvety
" ("Thank you for the flowers"), which had blown his mind on spot, and so would mine
If I were a chick, you'd have me at "Zmrzlinový".
Sorry, my mother, who also doesn't speak Russian in practice, went into a nursing school, where they had some classes in Russian, she memorized it this way and taught me
But don't you worry, I'll reprimand her for you the next time I see her
The next time I visit Greece, I must try to order gyros, tris, to see if I get gyros, tetrakis
How old are you
I'm asking because by my standards, at the age of 25 at latest, one should be able to swear in most European languages including Finnish, and not feel too special about that
I have randomly happened to know the word for bat in Serbian is šišmiš, but it hasn't got me any date yet :(
Very credible, I just remembered how impressed I was with a French guy at work, who used the term miniscule instead of lowercase
I have never learned Serbo-Croatian, but as I can understand what you have written, I believe you are close enough
Eric Cartman, is that you
I have been told "Serbo" is a homophone with the word for stash
What wordplays on that have Italian dads invented, if I may ask
Help, please
I just remembered there is probably some Hungarian swear phrase, that goes like \[azangyalat\], which I've heard only some Slovaks say, immitating Hungarians, but I can't look it up on Google, to figure out how exactly is it spelled (or divided) and what does it mean
Does it really exist
It should, because I remember I was playing table football in Budapest, with some random guys, we were talking in English, but I chanted the word when I let the other team score a lame goal, and those guys started laughing
Not in this case, I think the sentence in Russian would be "Spasibo za tsvety" (?)
Sorry, then
I am just getting a bit disappointed, that most replies involve perkele / kurwa / caralho / merde, etc
I was hoping to learn about some really oddly specific foreign words and explainations, how did people learn them
Anyway, I'd like you to know Italian is the second degree, when it comes to Slovak bosses ranting about someone, who did not comprehend their instructions
It goes like: Are you a Hungarian
(a stupid question raised) < an Italian
(the task performed in a way different than the one expected) < a Mongol
(a completely different task performed instead)
Oh yes, the latter is well known too
Meh, I suppose it's just that Mongolia is so far away there is absolutely no chance they'd understand a single word of their instructions
BTW, I remember drinking in a different bar in Italy, in Turin, where I had a pretty good English conversation with the patrons, but the drunkest one of them clearly called me a Mongol in Italian at one point in front of his buddies, assuming I won't notice, thus he instantly proved himself wrong
my grandma worked with mongolian workers who came to CSSR on some kind of socialistic workers exchange programme sooo she could say that and meant them :D :D
Prague is obviously [Vltava/Moldau]
Also, not my city, but Vienna has THE waltz: [An der schönen blauen Donau]
I fully expected this to be the Sandstorm
I'm giving Slovak hospitality
Halušky
I find this to be an urban legend for the most part
Compared to many other countries I've been to, we seem to be mostly unwelcoming, albeit not all of course
Honestly Stonehenge was such a disappointment for me personally
I've been there a few years ago and was excited to see those gigantic mysterious boulders that people just can't seem to shut up about
Turns out they're not quite as
Gigantic
I mean they're certainly big, but from everything I've ever heard about them, I expected so much more
[rohlík] a long bread roll you can buy anywhere in Slovakia, Czech republic and Hungary but basically nowhere outside of those countries, which is horrible, because it costs less than 10 cents and is perfect for sandwiches
Excuse me if I don't have the need to deep fry myself every thursday
I fucking love German soft drink culture, with the glass returnable bottles and selection of drinks, just fits my taste perfectly
Here people don't bother with glass since they're lazy and don't give a fuck about the environment, they will rather throw away tons of plastic (granted a lot of it is gonna be recycled but still)
Cunts
Don't you have like a smoking and non smoking areas
IMHO it's the way to make both groups happy to allow restaurant owners to have a separated smoking area max the size of the non smoking area
Wait what this isn't normal elsewhere
You kinda already did
Further proof Portugal is Slav, we sometimes eat potato salad mixed with rice with our holiday schnitzel
ok well I am usually buying them in lidl :D yes, bakery rohliky are a bit more expensive
"olovrant"
The word is nonsense in Slovak yet we use it
I thought it's French or something but apparently no
It's mostly meant for kids in school to eat between breakfast (7:00) and lunch (13:00) at about 10-11:00
Try this next time: third fanta, third coke, third carbonated water
Tastes the same minus the diabetes
Centuries of foreign rule does that, we share like half our meals with Hungary, other half with Czechs and our desserts speak Austrian German
On 1st ot September 1939, two armies invaded Popand, starting WW2
German and Slovak
Slovakia was also only country that paid Nazi Germany to export Jews into death camps
But we kinda wiggled the tail and like "not mention" things that happened until 1944 when army and partisans revolted against fascist regime
People always forget you exists Malta, so you are good
Because Hitler said so
As well as Czechoslovakia didn't technically exist
You weren't alone in that mess
> but sadly vast majority of czechoslovaks still wanted communists in charge
Nah
Only in Czechia they won
In Slovakia they lost
To converted fascist-party members, but hey, its not like there was much for pickings
Yes
They are usually filled with [apricots] or plums or strawberries, but I have seen some with just a jam and/or "tvaroh" (like cottage cheese)
They come either with breadcrumb and sugar and butter, but there can be used also poppy seed or cocoa powder or nuts instead of breadcrumb
Do you have "buchty na pare" in czech republic
They are more puffy, and also they usually do not contain whole fruit, only jam or chocolate if anything
I loved them as a kid
Marhuľa in Slovak
Usually whatever’s nearby, but preferrably Kebab in a wrap (Dürüm/Yufka/...)
And then I go back to that bar cause it’s too early to call it a night
I wake up and realize it was just a dream
Also I gotta pee
Or, if you are in Turku, you go to that yellow shack for some makkaraperunat
Spiš castle maybe
Bratislava castle or Bojnice castle
I don't know which is more important
But I guess UFO bridge is also pretty unfirgetable landmark
If we are to compare it to eifell tower in paris I'd stick with UFO bridge in Bratislava
Not very historical but rememberable
Probably [Bratislava Castle] since it’s well known
Nothing comes top-of-mind though
I’m not from Vienna but been there a couple of times since I live in nearby Bratislava, when I think Vienna I think Schonbrunn, Prater, Rathaus, Opera House, ... This the first time I’m hearing about that cathedral
Cathedral in Košice
Never visited the others but man, the palace in Split is amazing
Whenever we spend holiday in HR, usually on islands, I always take Jadrolinja to Split and wander the streets of Split endlessly
Now I know it almost as well as my home town
I love the famous statue, the buzz at the port, I hate the McDonalds in Joker shopping mall, love your new business district, the pedestrian zones near the bus terminal in city center, all the small little shops and streets full of life
družba in levice
lol
When I think about it maybe cause I live nearby (an hour away by car, bus or train) I never went there for a typical “sightseeing” multi-day tour I plan for myself like when I visit other foreign cities, I just always went for a specific one day trip, like we had school trips to prater or schonbrunn and the zoo, since I’m out of school I went there for a couple of business trips, and in winter we sometimes go with friends to christmas markets or iceskating in front of the rathaus, and I know some friends use to go to the opera but I’m not much of an opera/theater fan so I never went with them
Also I’m not religious so I’m not one of those people who actively seek out the biggest church in any city they visit (I have a couple of friends like that, not sure how common this behavior is elsewhere)
I have a cheap mountain bike that cost 300€ the requirements I have for the bike are basically only functional brakes and I´m satisfied
When it comes to the traffic, getting a driving license helped me to understand how to behave on the road, in my country (idk it´s probably the same in a majority of the EU) when you´re cycling on the road you basically count as a car and when you walk by your bike you´re a pedestrian
But I mostly ride on the less frequented/field roads
Slovak nazi state (WW2)
Slovakia today (1993-)
Czechoslovakia also sort of counts
If you count being free as being in two-nations country then we have been free since 1918
If not, then there are two periods
1939-1945 First Slovak State
Although we were german satellite
1993-today's Slovak Republic
century - 906/7 - Great Moravia
1918 - 1938 - Czechoslovakia
1945 - 1948 - second Czechoslovakia (still had free elections)
1989 - present
true
Czechs were independent for far longer
even Great Moravia was czechoslovak
> Sofia
For me the same, even my hometown of 80k people has more to offer
The whole Sofia is just one street with a few bars and commieblocks
It is usually better to check particular vanues/places upfront
But there won't be real nightlife like in NY or so
This but not in a city filled with tourists and scammers selling souvenir shits
Try Brno
And that’s Germany
In Slovakia cheapest shots in cheapest bars can go below 1€.
Well if anything is below 1€ it’s usually from some bottle that costs around 3-5€ when buying wholesale
(Cheap local vodka or flavored vodka) so there is still around 50 cents of profit per single shot
And these cheap AF prices are usually in smaller pubs outside capital city where wages are low and there is usually only one bartender
3€ for a shot of alcohol that cost €25 is a pretty good price
In many parts of Europe you pay that for a shot of Absolut Vodka or other €10-€15 bottle
In Slovakia the traditional shots were 5cl but recently most bars switched to 4cl
But we still put 8cl+ into Long Islands (gin, tequila, vodka, rum 2cl each)
In college I knew a couple of guys who used to start the night with quad shots and know a bar that only serves doubles after midnight and has discount on triple shots
In slovak it’s pronounced either as /ɦ/ or /x/, depending on where in the word it is
I'll visit Constantinople only as a member of Holy crusade
We use: “v Tramtárii/Trantárii” which is a made up country or a remote place
It has more of a negative meaning though
Edit: Seems like the Czechs use it too
Bruh sound effect #2
There is a saying here that "veverička" (squirrel) is called that because when it runs it bounces its bottom: "veje riťka"
Obviously, this is wrong, but the funny thing is there is a grain of truth in there
Veverička (as you've probably noticed) has similar form in many other languages and that's because it's derived from proto-indo european reduplication of root 'wer', meaning 'to turn'
not surprised about you guys
even we have many words which are linked with ancient gods and mythology of yours, I imagine your vocab must be full of it
I wouldn't consider 27 years a long time
My MA group in Uk was from 22 to 55 and it was amazing
Small class, cca 20 people and it made us very close
The age didn't matter at all
So yep
You stop giving shit about age after yoy stop being a teenager
Nitra - fraction distillation of liquified air, mostly
Hlohovec, comes from a plant called Hloh (quickthorn, thornapple, may-tree, whitethorn, hawberry)
Name is mostly derived from the local Earl's surname
Village of the royal fishermen and fishnet makers
You do realize it sounds very phallic, though
Masaryk University in Brno is the best Slovak university hands down
Awesome professors, interesting classes and the city itself is incredibly international
Love it there
Notable mention to Charles's University in Prague too
wait
half-eagle
which half and do your eagles swim
How about Vesihiisi
why am I thinking of mermaid-ish shapes tho
I somehow have it in my mind that sirens are these booby half-fish ladies, the singing and luring ships onto rocks so they can eat the sailors is the same
Todellakin
glad it's not just my brain making stuff up
also, any reason to paint nudes is obviously a good reason -even if it's to depict man-eating monsters
thank you, so I'm not going crazy yet
Anything related to top secret military installations, army capturing and researching UFOs or advanced military research
Our government has barely enough money to maintain 16000 men strong force with outdated Russian equipment, so there is no chance we would have Area 51 or stuff like that
I remember there was one (obviously American) movie in which terrorists have stolen top secret chemical weapon from Slovak military base and then kidnapped a train, I was almost laughing on how far away from reality that movie was
I remember watching some spelling bees competition in TV when I was a kid, and since it was dubbed into a slovak, I was like - are they stupid for having competition as that, must be so easy its literally spelt how it's said
I mean, it's not possible to do something like that ourselves, but it is plausible if Americans payed it with their own money
I heard there was some CIA facility in Poland too
Well that's also the thing
He would not need to refuse the money because of his ego, because the government would pay for the treatment
He would have completely different mentality
So no need of his previous partner to get involved
Plus they would already be getting some social money for their disabled kid
Could you give me please an example
I mean, I understand Czech, but can't for the life of me distinguish the dialects
Are these supposed to be enforced this way
I remember someone telling me that there is some cross-border toleration within EU for some of these "must-have" equipment in car between countries, as in if you are clearly a foreigner with foreign license plates from another EU country, if you car meets your domestic regulations, you are fine
I don't know how much of this is true though
I remember failing in behaving the correct way in Austria for couple of seconds before I realized "oh, this is what's happening
" I was driving on the highway and near a major exit, traffic started to get heavy and suddenly lots of cars went to the right shoulder
My assumption was that they are going to be exiting right soon and are just nice enough to use the shoulder so as to not block traffic going straight, as this is often done this way in Slovakia
So I continued going in the right lane, which was completely empty, but as the road was curved, I didn't know how far
Couple seconds into it, I'm being honked at from both the left lane and the shoulder lane, that's when it hit me and yeah, safety corridors in Slovakia are not in the middle, but on the hard right shoulder
Yeah that's what I thought
In Slovakia we have pirohy (same recipe as Polish pierogy), where the most popular filling is [bryndza] sheep cheese
We also have [bryndzové halušky] , which are sort of dumplings, but more like gnocchi - heavy on potatoes, that are soaked in bryndza cheese
We would top both dishes with smoked bacon
I'm confused by the kex issue -what pronunciation options are people disagreeing on
Greece, my goal is to save money to buy tiny house in Crete
I fell in love with Tenerife when I was there for two weeks because the people were very nice and carefree and apparently the weather is nice most of the year (I prefer temps 15-25)
I also love the culture and people of the US, but I probably wouldn’t want to live there too long because of their ridiculous levels of capitalism
I love nice friendly people who don’t have problems with foreigners
Tbh, we already got EU-passports
However, just like eurocoins, they got some national markings
I don't think they have anyone clever who knows about geography at customs in USA
I get a blank stare when I say where I am from
Hlava, ramená, kolená, palce
Kolená, palce, kolená, palce
Hlava, ramená, kolená, palce
Oči, uši, ústa, nos
Translation is the same as in English except there's added knees and toes line
I was writing a list but I hit the reddit post length limit
Definitely ex-PM Robert Fico
Hopefuly he goes to jail soon
Super markets in USA are huge
They have everything plus 20 times more
Lots of types of products, however also same products that pretend to be different, aka 30 types of cereals, and so on
To me its kinda wasteful and not very ecological
For example Walmart is a freaky place to go to, its as big as hangar
And the people there
I know lot of American who don't want to shop at Walmart
But Target is nicer
I think from the all, Traders joe was my favourite
It looked smaller and the products looked less wasteful and were nice
But for example in California they also have more variety in vegetarian burgers and lots of avocado so that works for me
The thing is, the coffe bar culture that we have in Europe, especially is some countries that take it to perfection as France and Italy, they don't really have it
It mostly just bars and you have to show and ID to get there
Also the bars are the beaches as Venice, long beach or Ocean or Pacific beach have some nice bars, but funny thing when you want to sit down and just enjoy it, you get constantly bothered by the server who either wants you to order a lot or get off because more customers means more tips
So sitting on a terrace is hard sometimes
I miss cafe bars a lot
Its my favourite place to go in Europe
To tell you the truth I absolutely love Pacific and Ocean beach and San Diego the mood there is really nice
However what was interesting was there was a lot of houses directly at the boardwalk
When you wanted a bar you had to go to a alleyway nearby
There were a few bars directly at the beach, but not that much, I guess the price must be huge
Lots of people in those expensive looking houses barbequing and just chilling with a beer looking at the sea
So that's the leisure
As a contrast to it you have cote d azur beaches which are just full of caffees and small shops and boulangeries, because French and their cafes
But there, no cafes
Unfortunately I am a coffee addict, so
However I have no idea how Florida beaches look like, so maybe better, not sure
But I imagine they are cocktail bars
San Diego basically saved USA in my eyes, great chill culture, good coffee (had good expresso with chilli and chocholate Mexican style) and amazing 50 cents tortillas
Would not mind having one of those houses at the beach
100% would open a cafe
I feel we might be just on the edge of making it in  Czechia and Slovakia without most of the problems you described for Baltics and Southern states, unless governments in near future fck up
Population is not declining, we've seen less Slovaks leave abroad than those who came back recently
We do have issues, wspecially the industry being too automobile focused, so there is a single point of failure for the economy
We recently got thousands of Serbians coming to Slovakia for work
As for overall birth rate vs death rate, it's more or less net 0, so we are seeing only slight increase in population as immigration currently > emigration
The median age is however increasing, but I think that's the case for most of Europe
Lol, as a guy from Slovakia, it sounds like a compliment
What the hell
It's weird that I instantly knew who said that quote (without hearing it before and before finishing your sentence)
It's like that doofus has some special, distinguishable type of speech
If they pay taxes here, they should definitely have the right to vote regardless of whether they are EU/EEA citizen or even someone outside of the EU/EEA
In certain cases I would even allow it to non-tax payers as well (e.g. pensioners) if they are registered permanent residents
I would hate to lose my voting rights in Slovakia
While I moved abroad 12 years ago, I am very engaged in Slovak politics
I am subscribed to 2 newspapers, 1 weekly, half a dozen podcasts, and arguably more engaged than an average Slovak voter
I *love* Slovakia, and hope to return one day, but as a gay man married to another man, the political situation does not permit me to do so in a way that would retain the recognition of my marriage
So I vote, and hope that’ll change
With whom could I troll Finland, specifically
You can hope
But from what I gather, this situation will not change here for a long time
Even the younger generation is quite conservative
Although according to the ECJ, marriages done within the EU should be equally recognised across the EU, doesn't matter if gay or not
Whether that truly applies in practice I don't know
This is pretty interesting to hear, because in Slovakia the foreign voters skew heavily towards liberal parties
In our last election, our most liberal party got 33% of foreign votes, but in total didn't get enough votes to get to the parliament
Although we only had 3825 foreign votes, that's like 0
1% of all votes so it's totally irrelevant
Soviet  socialism was all about giving people what they needed
Bot a thing more though
So, life was not bad
Just not good either
Not only speaking freely, the whole culture gets screwed and twisted
**"It's a spanish village to me"** - having no knowledge about a topic
**"I'm coughing on it"** - don't care about it
Well, Slovaks and Czechs understand each other without any major difficulties
People in southern Poland understood me when I spoke Slovak to them and I understood them when they spoke Polish to me
It requires more concentration, but it’s doable
I, personally, don’t understand Ukrainians, but when it comes to Russian, I could probably get by with a really simple conversation
I also speak German on B1 level, I am terribly shy when it comes to using it though, so I usually just go with English in other countries
Sadly no hungarian is a really weird language
In Slovakia I sometimes even don't know where one country ends and other starts
Usually a see a sign in Polish Hungarian and Czech and I am like oh we crossed
Super easy
What borders
simple, depends on the place and country, usually if you take a wrong rural road you end up in a different country, if you go by a big road they just ask you for passport and let you go within a minute
well, you usually get a message on your phone and that makes you notice :D
Damn true
I learned to ignore the messages very easily
yes I do, three of them each time, a friend of mine call it "the holy trinity"
We usually get basic survival info
Where the embassy is located, emergency numbers and so on
I've never seen pricing details
Great beer

Scot takes out the fly and yells at it "spit it out, SPIT IT OUT
23C right now @ 41% humidity
22-23 is my preferred temperature range for living (not too hot, not too cold)
Inside I consider below 20 as too cold and above 25 as too hot
Also I consider below 40% humidity as too dry air and above 60% humidity as too humid air
Maybe they are men
Dunno
But I have been in a lot ac battles when living with male roommates
Or in offices
23, 5 is perfect for me
21 is a gotta have a sweater and thick socks
Under 20 i will be hugging the radiator and put a coat on
So I read on it and thought the typical office temperature was made for men in 60ties wearing full suits
So I just believe women like it warmer and work better when they are now to shivering from the cold
So generally iys believed women like it warmer and 23 is perfect for us because our bodies retain heat differently
I walked all over Slovakia at night
Never really had a problem
I like walking
I walk a lot
Plus when drunk it helps me to sober up
My hometown is boring, small nothing much happens
Sometimes when I walked home from a pub, I had police car stop by and ask me if I wanted a lift
In Bratislava its pretty normal, at night everyone was walking to their own bus stop at night and then walking home alone
And yep I am a woman too
In Slovakia we have the [Fujara] it is kind of a giant flute
[this is how it sounds]
A music to my ears
The city of skalica has been one of the 3 centers of fight against Magyarization in Slovakia and has been the capital city of Slovakia for like, 6 days in 1918
For my hometown either the ottoman occupation (it was originally an anti-Ottoman fortress, withstood 6 sieges, but ultimately it fell) or the bombardment during WW2 (most bombarded town in Slovakia because of important railroad, more than half of houses were destroyed)
I think Greek people can just flex with the amount of historical events their cities had
Poděbrady and Nymburk
Remember, remember the 5th of November
However unlike in ww1, this cavalry charge was very much successful
I don't know if we have something similar with any Slovak writer, maybe Andrej Sládkovič, author of the longest love poem in the world, and his museum and the unique Love Bank in Banská Štiavnica
But his work is already public, iirc
In visual arts, we have a big Andy Warhol Museum of Modern Art in Medzilaborce, near the hometown of his parents
His brother Paul used to be present there before he passed away
Andy's foundation based in New York is represented in Slovakia by the author company LITA

hate (weirs)
gate (pants)
cap (male goat)
dub (oak)
pole (field)

Some more which came to my mind:

* sob (reindeer)
* cop (plait)
* rub (back side, e.g. of a playing card)
* hod (throw \[noun\])
Also Slovak language uses declination, that means the word can have different ending when used in different situations
That opens the space for some other words:
* bite (you **fight** \[plural\])
* byte (in the **house**)
* dupe (he/she/it **clamps**)
* cope (in the **plait**)
* rite (plural of the word **ass**)
I would add also that some words from OP also exist in Slovak, 2 of them with slightly different meaning:

* on (he)
* to (that)
* ten (this)
* brat (brother)
* list (letter or leaf)
* pasta (paste)
My arabic ex - the pooping business
Bidets and not bothering him
My American boyfriend, the ice and the ever present cold AC
So much ice everywhere
I have gotten so sick when I first got to his place because of the ACs in USA are being set as a stand in for an ice age
And every drink  is basically a cup full of ice with a little bit of drink in it
His favourite complaint about Europe and vice versa my complaint about USA is we walk too much (he likes it now, I did my public transport duty), bad services in restaurants (I hate tips he loves it) and no ice in drinks
And our lack of PDA in some places IN Europe
Also I feel like Usa is much more into that fake plastic appearance, but that may be just California thing
Omg exactly
My ex was arabic, and to say I learned so much about a sacred art of proper pooping
He even had an portable bidet
Also could never ever barge on him doing his business
As contrary to my current SO who could not careless if I talk or stare at him while on the toilet
To be fair, I freaking love bidets they need ti become a thing everywhere
*disagrees in Slovak*
TBH, the viszegraád 4 are not really east nor west europe
To me those 4 countries are the central Europe
In northwest Slovakia
A small factory  or a big house with big piece of land, nice car and still have a lot of money to save
Either a mansion or several houses / flats
Maybe one bigger house / apartment in capital city or two smaller ones
Don’t use taxis, especially the ones that park near main station and wait for customers
Use Uber or Bolt, the prices are much cheaper
(Sometimes 3 vs 30€ if you find a proper scammer)
Don’t enter restaurants in city centre where a guy standing in front is handing out menus and calling you in
These apply for all cities in Eastern EU, seen and heard of these in Bratislava, Prague, Budapest and couple of cities on Croatian and Bulgarian coast
You are so right, I've been in Pisa for a few days and man i was bored as FUCK, everything that's worth seeing you can see in one day spent most of my trip there just lying on the grass in the shade cause it was nice and cool in the stupid summer heat
Good thing that I had train tickets to several other cities in the region or otherwise I would be really dissapointed with my trip
No hate towards Pisa, its a nice city, but there is not much things to do, loved the We love Pasta restaurant tho
We have way to describe both, for to me unknown reasons, in SK language you can count from first or first floor up:
Prvé podlažie - first floor (the street level)
Prvé poschodie - first floor (the next one)
Same in Slovakia
The floor on street level is called “Prízemie” and the first upper level we call “Prvé poschodie” (first floor)
However, ironically, in my building we have the ground-floor marked with 1 in the elevator, because the building was designed by an Israeli company (and to my knowledge, in Israel they have a similar system as in the USA where the ground-floor is considered 1)

Actually we are really good at naming things
Comes from the fact we are from the middle of Europe so we are not limited by one language and can borrow some words/namings from neighboring countries and "slovak" them
Just our capital is named Bratislava which means Brother's glory or Celebrate brotherhood
We have Zvolen which could (my speculation) be translated to Evering or Bánska Bystrica could be roughly translated to "A clear stream near a mine"? Really depends
If ya want some boring generic name Slovenský Kraj literally means Slovak Region, luckily that's the only one I can think about
We have a place called Horny Bar
Yes, Horny Bar
In Slovak it means something else, but in english it's laughable
Nové mesto nad Váhom (New Town over Váh - a river)
I really love some of our region and urban naming, though street names are poor
I love names like Telgárt, Horehronie, Tatry, Nitra or Bratislava
Unfortunatelly some names that were changed recently , like Partizánske (partisans town) or Slovenské Nové Mesto "slovak new city" that is a village
Also id translate Banská Bystrica "mining creek"
Funny is, that Zvolen and Banská Bystrica  are 20 km apart and German names are Altsehl (old Zvolen) an Neusehl (new Zvolen)
Also in my mind are cities an villages on Liptov
They are literally names - Liptovský Mikuláš (Liptovish Nicolas), Liptovský Jakub (Liptovish Jacob), Liptovský Ján (Liptovish John) etc
Names after weekdays - Spišský Štvrtok (Spiš Thursday), Spišská Sobota (Spiš Saturday), Dunajská Streda (Danube Wednesday), Rimavská Sobota (Rimavan Saturday)
But for me are funniest city names after near objects - Modrý Kameň (Blue Stone), Červený Kameň (Red Stone), Cinobaňa (Tin Mine), Lúky (Meadows), Nová Baňa (New Mine), Senohrad (Hay Castle) and best of all, Kuchyňa (Kitchen)
Nové mesto nad Váhom
Yeah, also in slovak language, district city Nové Zámky (New Castle)
Parody content like memes and parody videos are not included in this ban
So, it's not as bad, in my opinion
Its just overblown here in Reddit
Noone I know irl cares about it (even in IT circles)
Well, they have 2 years to implement it right
I think we all remember how everyone started talking and doing something about GDPR just right as it was coming into effect
Read this:
&#x200B;
The information in media is very one sided
Always look on both sides of the coin
&#x200B;
I did precisely the same, for some reason I love military marches (be it German ones, French, Russian, Polish, Romanian)
I feel really weird because I personally don’t know anyone else who listens to it, but I am grateful that a fellow Reddit stranger does it as well
Anyway, I got to it through EU4, since I wanted to have a thematic music
I do indeed, one of the best channels for this type of content
One that comes to my mind is if you say something and don't want to jinx it, you should knock on something wooden and say "I have to knock".
Similarly, if you say something and don't want to jinx it, it's also quite common to say (usually beforehand) "I don't want to paint devil on the wall" (in Slovak it's not devil but "čert", devil is probably the closest translation)
Another superstition is for babies to have something red attached to the baby stroller, often a red ribbon (or to wear something red, but not near the head)
It's supposed to "catch" bad looks ("bad eyes") from other people, these looks are believed to be harmful, even induce illness or death
The red colour is supposed to attract the look
This is very common, I think some people do it just because of family habits and don't know the original meaning
Not sure if these are specific to Slovakia
Black cat crosses your way = Spit 3 times on a ground or a VERY bad event happens
Break a mirror = bad luck
Plate falls down and breaks = good luck
When you say something and don't want to jinx it, you should knock on something wooden asap
Stepping into an animal shit = good luck (or maybe bad
not sure)
The alcohol laws are the reason why I'd never want to live in Sweden
I like my booze
Amen, brother
Same here
The prices are too high as well, the non-existence of some alcohol brands (especially spirits like borovička) as well
Well, the west hates the east, the east hates the west, so I think the neutral zone is somewhere in the middle
It would be Banská Bystrica for me
Probably the central North
But dont we all love the mountains
Its kinda in the middle so it connect us
That's right
Tatras for the win
Honorary mention to Staré hory
in practice, of course yes, I do have guy friends as well as girl friends (well, maybe more girl friends than the guys, but still), but yes, there are people that keep saying that they don't believe in friendship between men and women, that there is always something more
to this my bisexual friend responded "so with this logic I can't be friends with anyone
" which I think is a pretty appropriate reaction
It's extremely common
I'm a Hungarian from Slovakia and from my experience yes, girls and boys can definitely be friends
Maybe it's just my generation, but boys and girls have always been able to enjoy friendships with each other
True, sometimes people assumed that there was something between them, but that was mainly from the older generation
My friends and me have always had a mixed group of friends, it was never exclusive to just one gender
Prosím(Please) - is the most common
If the number is unknown, you can add your surname as well
If it is someone you know(depends who it is) - Yes/Hi/Good Day
"prosím" (please), + surname
sometimes I add "áno" (yes) in the beginning
I answer the calls of my friends and family with "čau / ahoj / nazdar / serus" (hi), sometimes with "áno" as well
“This is Michal” - I think it comes from years I worked as a customer support agent at my college’s help desk, where I’d pick up with “Colorado College Helpdesk, this is Michal”.
In Slovak, I’d say it’s split between “Áno
” (Yes
) and “Haló?” (which is specifically a greeting used on phones and nowhere else)
If it’s family or friends, I go with “no lásko
”. I say it so often it’s one of few things my American husband knows in Slovak
Or rather Eastern Slovak
It depends
First known larger Slavic realm was formed here in around 623
Later the Principality of Nitra was formed which consisted of majority of modern day west and central Slovakia
Together with Principality of Moravia they formed Great Moravia in 833
Some sources indicates that even prior this the people in Principality of Nitra considered themselves to be ethnically different from those in Principality of Moravia
However, I guess it's too early to speak of Slovak identity but it's very possible that the differnt Slavic identity which later became the Slovak identity started to form at those times
At some point Great Moravia consisted of modern day Slovakia, Czech Republic, Carpathian Ruthenia, Hungary and some regions of Germany (where Sorbs live), Austria, Slovenia, Croatia and Romania
At this point the first known Slavic letters and codified language were formed (it's possible there were some writing systems before but we don't have a serious proof of it only some indications)
This Old Church Slavonic language was introduced by the pope as a 4th sacred language (a huge thing since the only 3 languages allowed to be used during services and to transcribe bible at that time  were Latin, Greek and Hebrew)
After its fall at around 903 the country split and Principality of Nitra became separate entity again
Together with Hungarians it formed Hungarian Kingdom in 1000 which was meant to be a strong kingdom housing various nationalities
Unfortunately, especially post-1848, Hungarians started to force Hungarian identity as the only state-approved identity
This caused Slovak people to unite and the word Slovak identity started to be used more often even by the common folks as something what unites them against so called Magyarization (forced assimilation and conversion to Hungarian identity which massively failed)
Before that, Slovak people knew they are ethnically and linguistically different from Hungarians but majority still considered themselves to be people of Hungarian Kingdom so the Slovak identity was something I would say secondary to the identity of inhabitant of the kingdom
But as I said this changed post-1848
Finally Slovaks united with Czechs in 1918 into the common country of Czechoslovakia
This was simply because it was easier to stand against former Austrian-Hungarian kingdom together
There was an independent Slovak state formed in 1939 but it's rather unpopular part of our history due to it being puppet state of a nazi Germany
It's questioned whether we had other options tho since either we ended up as German protectorate like Czechia or we are swallowed by Poland and Hungary who both had claims over the territory
Post war we formed Czechoslovakia once again only to be forced into communism due to their popularity in Czechia
Slovakia had major support for democratic party at that point
Anyway, Czechoslovakia ceased to exist at the end of 1992 and independent Slovakia was formed in 1993 again
So well
We consider our modern-day country to be created in 1993
But we also think the separate Slavic identify which later became Slovak identity formed somewhere in 7th century at times of Principality of Nitra
But its hard to say since we didn't have a need to use a separate term till like 17th century as we were usually a part of something bigger
Well Hungary was founded in 895 that was the year they entered this land
Every such shop in here offers vans for rent for very cheap
Or you can get it delivered for slightly more money
Edit: also why is US so obsessed with pick-ups
No matter how big they are it still cant compare to the loading capacity of a van
And as a daily driver its just oversized SUV without a trunk, so you dont have a place for your weekly groceries, unless you transport them in the back
It just seems all in all very impractical
When I was a kid there was an even bigger Skoda (1203) available for these purposes
>Most people who own pickups only occasionally use them to carry heavy/bulky cargo, they're used as passenger vehicles most of the time
So someome buys huge behemont that chugs down gas like it's free, to use it's single advantage only occasionally
Isn't it cheaper to drive some sedan, and rent truck/van when needed
I would go crazy if I had to reguraly drive pickup in my city
There are streets where it can't even drive through or fit in parking spots, and I would spend half my salary just for gas
Heh, I used VW golf several times and I think it's the perfect and most suitable car for my city: it fits everywhere like a glove and doesn't spend too much gas
I envy your parking infrastructure sometimes
Here, finding a spot is like a nightmare; not only in city center, but also on overcrowded suburbs
For example, one of the largest and most important hospitals in the capital city doesn't have a single parking spot, or garage, or any type of parking around it
Interesting "tato" means father in Slovak
Don’t forget about us
No because I was in a sports class and we bypassed these classes for more training
Then in the gymnasium we have no classes as that
Also they are gender separated and I consider it a bullshit
Many people live alone now and it's very useful for everyone to learn how to cook, sew, learn basic plumbing and around the house work
To be fair I am not fan of cooking, but I do it when I have to I just don't enjoy it
I checked and it was 5,759 for Russia and 5,9 for Usa
My mom always make some friends
I usually try to avoid it as much as possible (not by being annoying, more like being neutral - neither a friend and neither an asshole)
If they ask for something I'm usually trying to be helpful, but I'm not actively looking for an interaction
Might have something to do with my introvert nature and that I generally don't want people to be visiting my place
So I think the neighboring etiquette is whatever fits you and your neighbors
I would assume that it's more common to know your neighbors in villages than in the cities where you usually live in condos with possibly several dozens other families in the same building
It could go all ways, friends, enemies, frenemies, strangers
It depends
Depends on where I am
In my hometown I usually use a car, and it takes at least 4 or 5 minutes anywhere I would like to go
During the school year it takes me 2 hours and 30 minutes to get to the town where I study, but that's not a daily commute
In that town it takes me a 15 minute walk or a 3 minute ride on the tram to school
Another 5 or 10 minutes on the tram to work together with a 5 minute walk
15 minutes by bus on when the traffic is good - or 20 minutes by bike when the weather allows it
I actually really like Arabic female names
Layla
Alia
Amira
Jala
And then the nordid sounding names as Einar, Jengwar
And I really like Max or Félix
Kevin and Lena
[Obligatory]
Sometimes never
It's getting harder to get a loan, house and flat prices go up rapidly and we have very few places to rent
At the time when they decide to live on their own (either from their own will or due to e.g. work in different city) or when they are kicked out of the parents' house
It used to be (more or less) a norm to leave at the age of 18-19 in the communist era but it's way more common nowadays to see even 30+ people live with together with their parents due to economical reasons - buying house is quite expensive nowadays and as a remnant of the communist era people prefer to own the house/condo rather than rent it
That means renting is also expensive and hard to find one outside of the bigger cities and even in the big cities the quality of offers is often poor
Also it's common to see multi-generational houses especially in villages
People also sometimes bring their older relatives to live with them
Well in Finland moving out for university is quite different than how we understand it
Even tho they get dorms provided by university, those are usually without furniture and they bring their own stuff there
I was there as an exchange student and we had separate dorms exclusive to exchange students which were furnished
There were no Finns using them
I suppose the prices in Slovenia are similar to ours
In that case, it is 70€ per month
Well I have to mention that the quality of the dorms is .. lacking, to say the least
The walls are very thin, so you can hear nearly everything that happens in the rooms next to, above or under yours
You get a wardrobe, a night stand and a bed
People bring their own bedsheets etc
But wi-fi and food are pretty good
About our universities
there are three decent ones on the European level, the rest range from bad to worse
The best ranked one in Slovakia is Univerzita Komenského in Bratislava (UK), then Slovenská technická univerzita (STU), and Technická univerzita in Košice (TUKE)
But I mean, take into consideration [average salary] when comparing prices
I'm not saying that Dutch dorm rent isn't overpriced, but many seems to forget the income difference when both countries use €.
In the movie Dragonheart (a campy fantasy fairytale with Connery) there is a troupe of foreign dragon hunters
When they are to actually fight the dragon, one of them yells "Nabíjaj, rýchlo rýchlo nabíjaj" - "Reload, quick, quick, reload
Funnily enough, years later my brother actually met the actor
Yeah, I mix it myself from time to time (especially in summer), but I've never seen it sold in a bottle already mixed
After FIFA 19 I hate croquetas so much
Here it's only with women, although it's mostly just the older generations
Same, it's like fries with the shape of ball
Well I can’t decide if it’s desert or proper meal, probably the latter, but I love [perky]
and [makové šúľance]
This reminds me joke we have here: "Austrians are the smartest people on Earth: they convinced whole world that Beethoven was Austrian and that Hitler was German"
Looks like you have same sense of humor as Germans
We don't have many reason to develop better sense of humor, we mostly laugh at our country
Most of the people not as the primary source of heat
But almost every family house has a fireplace and uses it few times of the year
It was good for the nobility, terrible for the common folk
It was more or less standard monarchy with similar development as any other monarchy in Europe
However, the key turn-point was imho mid-19th century when very aggressive forced [magyarization] started
It just led to raise of a strong opposition and separatism movements in regions with minorities and that led into dissolvement of the monarchy post-WW1
Czechs had much better (but still not good tho) place in monarchy than e.g. Slovaks
Most of it comes from a bit more relaxed ruling and treatment of minorities within the Austrian part of the monarchy (where Czechs belonged)
Slovaks were treated differently due to a [magyarization] in Hungarian part
I wouldn't call their situation as "pretending to be a victim" either tho
I feel that separatism in Czechia was more about finally ruling themselves while in Slovakia it was more about getting rid of Hungarians and their oppressive policies
However, I'm surprised he didn't mention Kingdom of Bohemia at all
Is he the same guy from Death Stranding
Me lo voy a poner antes de dormir, su voz es muy agradable especialmente en combinación con la música
También me servirá para practicar mi pronunciación, ya que habla con mucha claridad
Gracias por la recomendación:)
Tousty (that's how you call them in slovak)  are tasty af
This is one of the games I as a Slovak person don’t want to play, but okay
Here we go:
We are producing a lot of cars
We are “the voice of reason” in the Central Europe
Like our political situation is a mess, but we at least don’t do stuff that worries the rest of the EU so that’s a win
We are the last bastion of reason, fairly liberal sanity and pro-european democracy in the central-east, surrounded by Poland and Hungary
We also guard the Slovak-Ukrainian border (although some will say not very well) and support Ukraine in their fight with Russia over delivering gas through Russian-Ukrainian pipelines to Central Europe
If Russia cuts Ukraine off, then Central Europe is partially cut off and that is a big problem in the winter
We also build your cars
Volkswagen, Škoda, Porsche, Kia, Jaguar, Land Rover, Peugeot, Citroen, all of those brands have some models being built here
Slovakia is #1 exporter of cars per capita in the world
And we are also a good source of a Slovakian-Slovenian memes
Spain is also doing the EU's dirty controversial work, keeping illegal African migrants away
Mostly the line from Morocco to Melilla
Im so sorry for that
We felt that shit even in Bratislava which is like 350km away
Slovakia has a mint (Kremnica), operating since 1328
Nowadays it mints euro coins, and also coins for some other countries around the world
Yeah I got very anxious when I read the question of this post:D
A mobster currently on trial for ordering the murder of a journalist investigating his shady deals with the government got his stuff confiscated and his chat logs with politicians and judges about how truly corrupt they are and the deep ties to the businesses and mob have with the ruling parties
Next year are elections (unfortunately for them) so hopefully we will cleanse that sewer
Truly fucking horrifying how these assholes basically ran a mob ruled state, we knew before but now there's evidence
Few months ago, a journalist and his bride were murdered
This caused a huge scandal and piece by piece, it was revealed that the ruling party had close connections with mafia, they were dealing with land, extremely corrupted and that the prime minister was in touch with very shady people
The journalists name was Kuciak, and the current guy whos voice records are being investigated today is Kočner if anyone is interested
Ultimately this lead to downfall of the social democeatic party which was in charge back then
It also influenced the presidental elections with social democrats losing to our current president Čaputová
> Orban
This is getting out of hand, now there are two of them
Everytime I travel anywhere east from Tatra mountains or to the rural central region
Or southern part
Or basically everywhere outside capital to be honest
How do you call the brach of government responsible for military
In Slovakia, it is "Ministry of Defense". Are there countries, which label the institution in a way that also suggests the possibility of *offense*?
EDIT: Wow, I can only imagine how much attention would I have got, had I not made a typo in the header :/.
It was called Ministry of war during the first (Czechoslovak) republic
This is quite interesting, that you put sport into the same category as defense and civil protection
Watch out, we have a badass over here (with nukes
In Austria-Hungary, which we were a part of at the time, it was Ministry of War
It does not sound very pacifistic
And there has been no war since
What a lifehack
If I may steer the question a bit, it seems France is currently the only country in the EU, which does not adhere to the "self-defense" naming convention
Doesn't that scare you a little, especially since they are the only country in the EU presently, that possesses nuclear weapons, and considering your mutual history
In this regard, aren't at least some Germans in favour of funding a German nuclear programme, just to seize the opportunity, that you are still getting along with your old nemesis
OK, you may keep the nuclear programme
HEY EVERYONE
LOOK HERE
They want us to think they are all into defense, while secretly, in a cryptic language
Come on, spit it out
Who's the target
Is Lukashenko's intel correct
Are you the NATO representative, planning the invasion
Or is it Kaliningrad oblast of Russia
I think it makes more sense than combining education and sport
I think combining education and sport makes just about the same sense as combining culture and sport, little less sense than combining defense and sport and much less sense than combining it with anything else
However, I find the most sense in creating a dedicated ministry
Guys, please
I can put together a couple of simple sentences in German, but I shiver when I imagine learning French from scratch
I see, but how much is the actual inflation
Or -just out of curiousity- how many $ or € could buy me a small 2-room apartment in the outskirts of a large city
And what would that dedicated ministry do
The fact is that the government is doing minimum for sports and it doesn’t really make sense to do more than that
Sports aren’t a cohesive field and the current system where each sport has its own national-level association which is funded by the ministry is good enough
The only thing I can imagine that the ministry could do more is some sports marketing
I’ve just googled that our gov financially supports over 70 sports associations and I’ve never even heard about 10 of the sports (like wtf is korfbal or boccia) and for another 10 of them had no idea there’s even interest here let alone gov money (we have baseball and petanque in Slovakia
Where
Now that I think about it combining with schools or culture can be a good fit because of the reach they have
Combining with army could make sense if there was overlap between army and sports personal (I can imagine that physical training for army and some sports can be similar)
I didn't assume you were joking; what made you think I did
I am sorry housing is getting so unaffordable for most of you, although it is interesting for me to see, how real estates retain some value, when money is becoming worthless, which is partly why I was asking
As for the other part - I still have a better idea where to settle in, although I'd love to explore Your country one day
Oh, don't You worry, I've studied economics, and I've seen [this] so you can hardly surprise me
I don't drink alcohol and our national cuisine isn't very appealing to me at all (except for 'bryndzové halušky', non-smoked cheese products and few kinds of soups and maybe other dishes I currently can't think of)
Also I am not a fan of hockey or any other sport
Skáče jak Srb - jumping like Serb , meaning someone is aggressive
Čo si maďar - what are you hungarian , meaning if someone doesn't understand you
We have some:
"pere sa ako žid do neba" - his pushing himself like a jew to heaven (when someone is trying to put himself to a spot, like get to the train trough a crowd but also like get a position in company etc
"zničený ako cigánská hračka" - destroyed like a gypsy toy (when one is completely exhausted and doesnt feel well, for example in the morning after heavy drinking)
"pracuje to ako švajčiarske hodinky" - it works like swiss watch (when something works flawlessly)
"fajčiť ako turek" - to smoke like a turkish man (when someone smokes too much)
"čo si maďar
" - Are you hungarian
(if someone doenst understand, or if someone is doing something in very different way than what is custom, for no apparent reason)
"to je pre mňa španielska dedina" - it is a spanish village to me (meaning i cant understand that at all)
"na židáka" - like a jew (meaning if someone is avoiding to pay but takes something out of it, like for example goes to the party, brings nothing but is drinking what others brought)
"russká robota" - russian job (sloppy job)
"raz za uhorský rok" - once in a hungarian year (meaning very rarely if ever)
"mexická/španielská telenovela" - mexican/spanish soap opera (too much drama for no reason)
"zima ako v rusku" - cold like in russia (when it is too cold outside)
"s kľudom angličana" - calm as an englishman (doing something stressful calmly, easily)
"zlaté české ručičky" - gold czech hands (it is being used in czechia as "being handy", here is it being used in ironic way, if someone screw something up)
And not really saying it self, but during soviet era people used to say (and some still do jokingly):"keď klamem, nech sa na miesto do západného nemecka prepadnem" - If i lie, i shall fall on the spot into western germany (as western germany was being pictured as a terrible place, so it was a joke on communists)
We do the same, but we also whip them with a wooden whip to be 'beautiful and healthy' for the next year
I've seen some people doing it here as well, but we call the doll/effigy Morena instead
I have actually heard that Czechs don't do that
At least my friends from Moravia, who said that what we do in Slovakia with sprinkling and whipping girls is a stupid tradition
They do family reunions and dinners instead
Don't know whether that's true for the whole country though
Fuck, that's hot
Why don't we have something similar here
Also, it seems like the gayest sport ever
Wonder what the contestants think while they grab the other one's ass or
you know what
Turkey
you have some explaining to do
King Svätopluk of Great Moravia
I mean yeah, first true king od Great Moravia, expanded his realm to its greatest extend and he did beat just about every neighbor, he even has a statue in front of Bratislava castle
But the more you look into his reign, the worse it gets
He overthrew his uncle Rastislav, who unlike Svätopluk, had stable reign, modernized the realm and got Great Moravia out of Frankish influence almost completely
Besides , Great Moravia fell apart upon Svatopluks death
History would have been very different if Rastislav stayed on the throne
This is fucking hilarious
We did basically the same, but we barely had a choice
That sounds exactly like a perfect answer to this post's question
Idk for example in Slovakia it’s 331 eur
I don’t consider that a lot
Sure it may be for some people, but mostly if you really want it you can afford it
But lots of people either don’t know the price and think it’s much higher or don’t want it because it might make them look pompous
Wow, that’s cheap AF
For example we pay 66 EUR now for new plates when you change your residence into another district, because the plates have your district on them
But thankfully today our government voted on removing this stupid rule so soon it will be history
not corrupted government, february's elections give me last hope for a change
I am the only person I know who writes "Ƶ". I just like it that way
I do that too sometimes with my food so I have my other hand free to do other stuff
A couple of years back, when I was a student, they passed a law that every classroom must display the national flag and the anthem, to "increase national awareness in the youth". I thought it was pathetic
We got nazis in the parliament about the same time I reached voting age
Do you have dirt and trash lying around your house
You've just been outside, youre bringing the shit from there back to your home wtf
But then why did the other person ask me how I'm doing
Why play games
Seems disingenuous to us,if you ask how I'm doing you better be prepared for a tirade about the negative impact of late stage capitalism on young adult's mental health
I always thought it's also because held down, the water in the flower is kept in the head and the lower part dries up first then
I'm personally a "finally taking a shit in the comfort of your home after being away all day" connoisseur
Proper bread has a thick, hard crust, almost like a shell, and is soft on the inside
I've never encountered any pre-sliced bread like that
I have these two plastic coins on my keys that I use for it
You can get it in any promo material giveaway
It's like keychains, pens, notebooks, plastic coins for a cart
In most stores here they have a thing that you have to put the coin there and close it, hard to describe
Like this:
So you can't use that
Definitely the [Apollo Bridge] in Bratislava
It looks fantastic, got multiple awards, everyone from Bratislava loves it and is a great contrast to grey communist bridges
The photo is a bit old, there is a shitton of tall office buildings behind it now, so it doesn't look out of place right now at all
Then, since Bratislava got crowned as the 3rd richest EU region, we had to step up our game and a new business district started to get built (called Downtown or historically Nivy)
It's pretty fancy, new tramline, underground bus station, huge futuristic mall, pedestrian bridge across Danube, river swimming resort, and just a good overall architecture with office buildings (most of them are in various stages of being finished)
The building process in that district is pretty aggresive, we finally get our first skyscraper (more than 150m in height) and a ton of almost-skyscrapers
The most notable part of it is [Sky Park by Zaha Hadid] which is almost done right now
It did not disappoint, looks great on visualisations and in person, although the photos I could find didn't do it much favor
It also houses the most expensive penthouse in the city, valued at 1,6M €.
Wow
That's the best one in my opinion here
I really love how they're making great use of the space around these new buildings
My favorite place is the [riverpark] of the Eurovea mall in the centre
They're making some very people and pedestrian friendly choices, which I love
Although Bratislava has always placed a huge emphasis on people ([Ruzinov] is an amazing district with lots of trees, parks and greenery, despite housing tens of commie blocks)
Riverpark is also very good, although it's in a weird place, we don't go there much often since there is only Riverpark and nothing else
Also has a bad rep since a huge corrupt Slovak investment company built it
They also build 50 % of the new downtown, but did a way better PR job there :D
Ružinov is amazing, I lived there for 15 years and couldnt be more happier
Trees, small lakes, all very people-friendly, close to city center
Yes, the communist houses (we call them "Paneláky" or Concrete panel buildings") are there, but it's not a big deal
They are without issues on the inside and since there is ton of parks and tall trees everywhere, and they are also painted very colourfully, you never think of them as a communist building, although they are
No issues with them
If I had to recommend only 1 district, I would 100 % recommend Ružinov, although most of the others are very good as well
I actually think that the Markthal looks pretty cool
I would even say that it’s the best from OP’s examples imo
Yes, it's the only way forward
If we stay fragmented then China, Russia and others would buy every important politician and company and we are fucked
Also, small countries like Slovakia are hugely dependent on bigger countries in Europe in almost everything
So, I would go as far as creating something like the USA in Europe
Closer integration is the key, fragmentation means more corruption and more outside influence
For Czechia it absolutely has to be Divá Bára

She is this headstrong village girl that doesn't care that she is unpopular, she is also by far the smartest one at her home
And she is fiercly loyal to her friends
She is also friends with animals

But me and my friends wanted to know more about Finland winter war
And we were teaching teacher
Not once did I hear this, although I know all about it as I’m kind of a WW2 buff
The Finns are badass, and smart too
They’d cement busted tanks into the ground as static gun positions
If I recall correctly - not at all
But me and my friends like the topic of WW2 so we read about it
My personal favourite is [Orava castle] Even several movies were made them like vampire classic Nosferatu and the new series The Rules of the Beast
Also Dragon Heart was filmed here
UFO bridge in Bratislava , or upside down pyramid,  that works as Slovak TV and Radio brodcaster
I heard about that, it was ridiculous
It's as if American citizens should get away with crime, like what the fuck
r/Nottheonion at this point
I have eaten homemade schnitzels with bread on trips with my family so many times that I have lost my count
That's like one of the most stereotypical Slovak tourist habits I have heard about
Did you jump into a fountain, wore stupid clothes or overall and sang loudly
It doesn't matter, I have eaten them in bread rolls, regular white bread and even in toast, lol
My most favorite language is probably Polish, but I also really like Czech, Russian, English (especially Scottish dialect), Korean and Japanese
Italian, Spanish and French sound good as well, but not as much as these other languages
My parents / grandparents and uncle used to call me "malý" which basically means smol
We have something similar with “mladý” or “mladej” in a dialect
for very little kids ´´malý´´ and ´´malá´´
small one
you are the small one until you grow into young one
it is not, my native language is taught only on Memrise
german tree for english speakers  is the best and longest one
it takes you almost to B2 level

their way
it is very good course for reviewing, for advancing form A1 or even A2 to something better
yes, it has some cons, yes you do not pay anything unless you want extra features
duolingo has its own website, if you cannot find the app
The part of Slovakia where I live it’s mostly ghost sightings, which is a pretty popular subject throughout the country
For example, Bratislava’s got the ghosts of some corrupt city officials from the 17th century that made a deal with the devil - stories said they’re still haunting a building on the Green Street
Then there’s the White Lady, usually women who died in childbirth, got killed by their husband or were jilted brides
An exception is Levoča’s white lady (real historical figure - Julianna Géczy) - this one they executed
Quite an interesting story though
She’s supposed to haunt several places, which must be very taxing for her, poor one
Here i feel like this is a regional thing
It really depends on the event itself, but generally i would say people bring their bottles, which they open and pour drink to anyone
However having said that, when i lived abroad we have met some czechs and slovaks and organized a party where everybody brought something
Yet those slovaks were just opening random bottles and pouring drink around, which surprised me to the degree when i had a culture shock of my own people
So i dont know if that is a regional thing (which might be because despite the size of the country, there are some significant differences between regions) or those people were just straight up being rude, but i havent met with anything like that before in my life
But it is very weird to me, especially if someone brigs some better bottles (as we did) and someone else is opening them like his own
I suspect you havent seen the [spanish easter celebration] yet
I travelled with Italian in Bulgaria
He could not get over cucumber on a pizza
But Fox news told me you guys are socialists wtf
We're with Germans on this one, you go to a party, you buy booze, which you contribute to the shared pool
Now, if you're a connoisseur like me and don't like to drink cheap shit, it's an unspoken rule to not drink from my fancy Honey Jack Daniels at least not without my approval
But many a times it happened that I went to a party with my two bottles of Jack, 20 euros each, only to have them drank within two ours, me still sober and having to finish myself with some shitty ass French liquor and home made 50% slivovica, which meant I was mixing my spirits, resulting in my untimely puking into a bus station bin at 5AM to the horror of onlooking commuters, kurva piče to bola noc
We share alcohol in gonna get smashed party to
It's just nice to bring a bottle with you to a party, and then you put it on a table with other bottles and then drink everything there - if you wanna get smashed
You can drink your own, but definitely at some point someone will pour you something else from those bottles there
I mean people normally don't bring their 30 years old single malt whisky to those, it's usually just normal alcohol 10 and down per bottle
Beer is cheap in general, so no one cares
Yes, we have the black cat too
I mean with a hat and nice overalls
Bruh that socialism thing was a joke
It's only Bulgarians and Macedonians who are traitors to Slavs in this
Our public TV has a lot of Italian content for some reason
And German
That we drink A LOT
that’s the the stereotype I see the most, told mostly by people from here, which is quite funny since this is also said about Germany, Ireland, The UK, Czechia, Russia,.... like every other country
it’s not original, not cool and not true
Uk is amazing with international food
London is so good when it comes to a top cuisine
But generally things that are usually eaten around UK are a pass for me
I dont like friend fish
I dont like meat pies
i have been all over Uk ate at the best pub even where the menu was 30pounds and was like yeah ok
I dont really east meat so for me it was a pass
I am a big fan of pasty thought
And all the indian food
And jacked potato
Well I lived in Birmingham, thry invented a lot of local mixed cuisine
I did
I've been to a lot of them when I lived there
That's what I ate, but I don't consider vegan food traditional British food
But generally I prefer different type of food than I found in UK
Yeah, but when I think vegetarian, UK cuisine does not exactly jump into my mind
So then yes, I had veggie pasty which I liked and lot of jacket potatoes
I thought the veggies I was used to were harder to get around fresh in UK
So we shopped a lot in Asian shops or Indian places for ingredients because Indian can be pretty vegetarian
I love eating cheese but for that I am pretty much a French whore
But when I think traditional British food, even local places, as I lived in both Cornwall and England
But I age cornish can make some pretty good fish when it's not fried
I am not fan of my native food too or Czech, German or Austrian, I do find them a bit unhealthy so I unfortunately put British into this too
I loved the fusion restaurants in London or Birmingham, however traditional British food (minus pasty) is a pass for me
I eat meat for special occasions, like visiting, or when I went to an Iraq wedding or in Kenya or family tamales in Mexico
As long as it's sunny and not windy or cloudy I can function in short sleeves when it's above 0C, preferably above 5C tho
Above 15C I usually don't care about wind conditions and I just wear short sleeves automatically
Juraj Jánošín - a thief, basically the Slovak Robin Hood
Anton Bernolák - first successful codification of the Slovak language
Ľudovít Štúr - the codifier of the current Slovak language, a politician, with his group they have done numerous of things to help the folk like teaching, lending money to people in need or running anti-alcoholism groups
Revolutionary in the Autro-Hungarian revolution (although not a good one) and cofunder of the first national Slovak assembly during the revolution
Some consider Jozer Tiso as a national hero - the president of the first Slovak state, highly controversial
Hanged for war crimes after WW2
If you ask me, he was a neccesary evil who did the minimum (or something above) to not get replaced by someone even worse
I wouldn't consider him a hero
Alexander Dubček - Czechoslovak president before 1968
Throughout totalitarianism he worked hard to make Czechoslovakia more democratic - reducing censorship, improving free speech, it had been to such a degree that the USSR invaded us in 1968 and established a period of normalisation until 1989
For Slovakia there's also Gabcik and Kubis (in WW2)
Milan Rastislav Stefanik for the first republic of CZSK
Svatopluk (they call him the first Slovak king, even though that's nonsense)
Probably the three leaders of 1848 (Stur,  Hurban and Hodza), who also established the base for current Slovak language
But we also have many from our past with the Austrians and Hungarians (Maria Theresa and Joseph II
for the school reform, Matthias Corvinus for getting rid of the bandits in Slovakia and so on)
Maybe because they're owned by the same company
A lot of people say ‘omg’ but don’t pronounce it the same way the English would, or ‘lol’ is quite popular and people literally say it in conversations, not just in text messages
Obviously people who can speak English a little better use a lot more words but these are the ones that I’ve heard from people who speak no English at all
We used to play "podkopavana", kinda like football, but you didn't have goals, you just had to dribble the ball, while the others tried to trip/kick you and take the ball away and be the chased one
Same in Slovakia, yellow car or smart
If it was yellow smart you got 3 punches
I've never heard about this
Don't be upset, man
Foreigners generally don't know about us
About big towns, we don't really have them big, there Bratislava and then other bigger places as Košice, Žilina
I am usually amazed if they heard anything beyond Bratislava
Košice, more than 200,000 people, direct flights to many Western European capitals and an old town prettier than in Bratislava
My god, that cathedral is amazing in person
Love that city
Brno is overrated, Olomouc is the heart of Moravia
It's beautiful
I can confirm that if someone knows Bratislava, that's pretty good, but if someone unpacks something like Košice, Bardejov, Poprad or other more famous city, that's the performance of the year
When talking about Slovakia, we often get "Yeah yeah Slovakiaa, Czechoslovakia, Hamsik, Skrtel, Zdeno Chara, your president is amazing and you make a lot of cars" and after that, they are completely lost
I'm sorry, but until this day, I thought Nicosia was the capital, and also the only city I knew
Is it not
Ah, my cousin studied there
Piran is an amazing town
Wait what, tell me more about this
To be fair, I would hope our polish neighbours would know a little bit more
Glad kids are keeping the knowledge
Most Poles I've met actually hardly knew Bratislava and nothing else from Slovakia
You're referring to Luník IX
It seems quite popular on the Polish internet
Ive never been to Košice and it makes me sad
But come back to Bratislava
The city always changes, nightlife is great and you can combine it with a trip to Vienna:) Now we actually got a good mayor who is putting the city together at an incredibly fast pace
I like it too
Nice place
Glad you enjoyed it
I met some people in SF that travelled around and even named Strbske Pleso
It was a nice change from Is that where the trump wife is from comments
Trenčín is definitely an above average Slovak city, happy you liked it:) The castle on the rock adds a nice touch to it
Haha very cool
The same happened to Štúrovo/Esztreszgom
But the Hungarians got the sick church on a hill, I think it's the largest Central Europe church
, and we got kebab food and shitty town square :D
Well I would expect our neighbours to be able to name at least 3 cities
Oh wow, you win
Banská Bystrica is actually my favourite town
Well with that I would hope neighbours would know a bit more
But go further Europe and go Northern America and be amazed when it shifts from Czechoslovakia to actual towns
Also got Czechoslovakia in France and Italy
Esztergom, that's a pretty town
Also the historical capital of Hungary one time
He probably means top-of-mind- But I cant phantom why he would think of Prague
Nah we're Slavs so no point in learning
We're "barely European".
Well, even Ljubljana is barely a city, let alone any other Slovene towns lol
It's an even smaller country than Slovakia
But it must feel more "exotic" to Poles
Even you Hungary  Honestly i got used to it
Plus czechs ate still bros
Plus its much better than thinking we speak Russian
Rakúsko-Uhorsko
Uhorsko doesn't mean Hungary in Slovak but the whole area of that part
It included parts (or the entire) of present day Slovakia, Hungary, Transylvania, Croatia, Serbia and Bosnia (maybe Slovenia too
English lacks a word for Uhorsko
Rakúsko-Uhorsko
What’s interesting though is that Slovaks have different names for today’s Hungary - Maďarsko - and for the Kingdom of Hungary - Uhorsko
Maďarsko basically means “the country of Magyars/Hungarians”
Uhorsko means, if I am not mistaken, “country by the mountains”
Rakúsko-Uhorsko
Sa ti hovorí, keď ste boli pod Rakúskom a nie Maďarskom
No, it’s actually named after a town in Austria called Raabs an der Thaya
Over the centuries the area around this town became know as Racouz and from that derives our term “Rakúsy” which eventually became “Rakúsko”
>Tamnica naroda
Similar in Slovak "Žalár národov" (žalár \[žal = žiaľ = big sadness; žalár - room of big sadness = prison\] is basically different name for temnica \[temný = dark; temnica = dark room = prison\], which is Slovak version of tamnica)
Let's say we wouldn't earn a high place, if someone decided to rank countries by their general tolerance
We do drink a lot like many other slavs
You know, it's similar here
However it's a fact that about 50% of them live off of welfare here
Their ghetos are actually dangerous and the most notorious thing is stealing or collecring iron other metals
Seriously, there many cases where they take out all the metal parts from their own houses or apartments to sell them
Some of their clans or families, or however it is called, have the mentality that "working is not the gypsy way to gain money".
This applies to the dishonest ones of course
You can barely recognise the honest ones as "gypsies" on sight
It's often the behaviour, body language (or even bad smell) how you recognise a "gypsy" on the street
It's a problem of mentality caused by the past
>According to his vocabulary there were romani: the ethnicity, and gypsy: the way of life that you just described
That's how I often use it as well
I don't care if the shitty ones get offended over it
I would never call the normal ones that, I don't even aknowledge them being roma since I don't see them by their race, I don't really care about it
Created in 1992
Amended 22 times since then
We require 3/5ths of MPs to vote for amending the constitution so politicians like to put random stuff there so that it’s not easy to overrule it with a simple majority (e.g. in 2014 the coalition joined with opposition catholic and conservative parties for a quid pro quo - judicial reform AND a definition of marriage as a bond between a single man and a single woman got pushed to constitution at the same time
In 2019 populist parties across coalition and opposition pushed pension age (64) there so it can’t be easily changed even though they all admitted it may mean problems for our social systems as soon as 10 years in the future)
veverička in slovak
Slovakia
Veverička .... not translatable
The same in Slovak - veverica
It was only a joke in an old local sitcom as far as I know
Personally, I haven't heard it outside of that show or when someone was referencing it
Mostly regarding some totalitarian regimes
E.g. policies regarding China (one China policy, non-recognition of Taiwan and that except for president nobody mentions human rights at meeting with Chinese officials)
Also that policies towards Russian government tends to be less strict even tho there is no actual shift in their policies which could justify that
Also very lenient reaction on recent Turkish aggression in Syria (I'm not actually sure whether there was any reaction on that at all)
Daaamn, I once want to go to a karaoke where people will be willing to listen to me sing Kraftwerk
Yeah, what is even going out
This post made me miss karaoke so much, and thats something I havent done in years
I now have this fantasy of me doing  Wir fahren fahren fahren auf der *Autobahn*  in a crowded karaoke bar, and i am loving this vision
The other people probably not
I love Spacelab
So hard to find mates that are into Kraftwerk
I would love to use trains to travel around Europe, but most of them are unreliable and you can have huge delay
Slovakia do have terrible trains and railroads
One time I went from Kosice to Bratislava to visit my cousin, it is 400km, took me 8h. Terrible experience
We have a direct train from Bratislava to Zurich that does it in 9 hours for 40€. Flying takes around 4 hours in total (with transportation to/from airports and airport overheads)
That’s probably the longest one I would consider and only because of the ultra cheap price and it being a direct train
Your guys do the best films by yourself anyway
British cinema itself is great and diverse, from romantic stuff to great blackhumour comedies to dramas to even horror films
I was buying plaster in San Francisco and the girl in the shop looked at me as if I was stupid
I couldn't remember American word at all so I had to describe her what it was
Everyone was WTF is a plaster
And yep About time a house in Cornwall, a lawyer living in London, lucky enough to have parents who were friends with a guys who had a house in London
And the girl, had some pretty awesome flat, and no roommates at all
They were loaded
Also ever seen Karluv most this empty in the evening if the weather is good
I wondered how would they ever manage to squeeze Russian wheel into Prague squares
That was Signal festival
I have a friend studying in London right now, he wishes he could slum it this way too
I learned quite late at 9
Other kids were taunting me about not being able to ride a bike
I got pissed, took a bike and rode down the steepest hill around, then kept pedaling around like it was nothing, practically learned instantly
Everybody shut the fuck up, clapped, world peace, you know the drill
Grandma taught me when i was no more than 7 , she would take her old communist bicycle and make me ride the old dirt roads behind our village
Slovak nazi state, from 1939 to 1945
The Samo guy
Some do, but many see 1st CS republic as an ideal state
Some find later commie years (normalizácia) to be a great period to live in
And let's be honest, whole Slovak national revival period is heavilly romanticized by most Slovaks as well
Idk we got neo nazis in the goverment soooo
Probably 'Ružomberok', really dirty city because of factiories, endless traffic jams
I would also nominate Petrzalka, although it's getting better
Yes
It’s not like for our accent (which is recognizable), but Nitra dialect has also a bit different usage of grammar
In standard Slovak and most dialects, the correct way to say the sentence “Come to the store
” is “príď k obchodu”, but in ‘nitránčina’ it is “príď pri obchod” - and that little change between ‘k’ and ‘pri’ IS ALWAYS pointed out
When topic of dialects come up in pub or somewhere like that
“haha you speak funny in Nitra, you use ‘pri’ where you shouldn’t, don’t you
How can you, it’s so strange to use it that way
In Slovak it's the misuse of "y" vs "i" in words and conjugation
Both are pronounced more or less equally, but there are different rules for when to use which one, and then there is a list of words that are an exception to those rules etc
&#x200B;
Use of "y" vs "i" at the end of an adjective, tells whether your're talking about something in singular or plural, where "y" is always a singular adjective
dobrý = good singular
dobrí = good plural
however !!! :)
s dobrými = with good plural
&#x200B;
In some words use of "y" at the end of nouns makes the noun plural
strom = single tree
stromy = multiple trees
&#x200B;
However, in some other words you CAN'T use "y" to make the noun plurar, but must use "i"
chlap = single man
chlapi = multiple men
&#x200B;
The rules are very random and you just have to memorize them
Napadlo ma vs
napadlo mi
Napadlo ma - means you were attacked by something
Napadlo mi - means came to my mind
Most of the people use only napadlo ma and it's annoying when you know the difference
My and mi - first one means we and the second one (to) me
EDIT: might be helpful to say that both are pronounced the same
Having said that, anyone using Y at the end of a verb, which is simply never correct
Prišly sme domov a najedly sme sa
I get that one sometimes forgets the more random rules in regards to y/i usage, they are arbitrary and frankly, y should not even exist within Slovak alphabet
But the verb thing shows me you are a complete idiot
I forgot about the verbs, but yeah "y" on verbs is a great filter that tells you you are talking with an idiot
>... using Y at the end of a verb, which is simply never correct
While mostly true, - *umy sa
* exists
Karu selli
Ha, fair
Reminds me of my favorite Eastern Slovak verb in imperative that does not exist in Slovak - rošni
Well I think in most Universities here this isn't a thing, besides from medical ones and few others maybe
Although we had something kinda similar here(at University) called Prax, for 2-3 weeks(4 hours per work day)
You had to find it yourself, it was free ofc and you barely learned anything
I mean if you wanted to get paid during University, your best bet here(and usually the only thing), where I studied was working as cashier at Tesco or McDonald's lol
The country you are working at, is responsible for social benefits and so on
and most EU countries have this well regulated under variety of emploee protection programs
Im probably gonna blow your mind with this, but if you worked enough years in two countries you will get pensions from two countries when you retire
Oh yes, one more entry in Slovak: Snatch by Guy Ritchie has been translated as "Podfu(c)k". "Podfuk" in Slovak means a scam and does not derive from the f-word at all
It's even a tier-2 pun, because a more expressive way to put a scam or subversion in Slovak is "Podjeb" which derives from "jebať", which in fact is the f-word
It would render to German as "unterficken". I don't know how clearly I put it, but if one thinks in some blend of Slovak and English, it just fits perfectly
Shanghai Noon with Jackie Chan was translated as "Once upon a Time in the East". It was impossible to pun on High Noon in Slovak, but I think they did their best
"Die Hard" is translated as "Smrtonosná pasca" which means "deadly trap".
"Now you see me" is translated as "Podfukári" which means "scammers".
Maybe you should have sticked with Merkwürdigliebe, it got so confusing with Marvel these days
I think those words are synonyms in this case
Robbed in a face-to-face confrontation by 2 gypsies
No, not really
I've been able to avoid trouble so far
My iphone was stolen once
I had someone break into my (forgotten) Origin account and buy a shitton of FIFA microtransactions, I managed to get them all refunded
There is [this] popular punk band who once made a pretty funny Rammstein parody, by playing their music style and throwing in random words in Slovak
Or, actually, there are [two] These guys just took the chords of Amerika and sing along names of all places in Slovakia, which they find to be shitholes
Since the release, nobody takes foremost the titular town of Prievidza seriously
The vast majority of the music I listen to is black metal and post-metal
I also unironically like Ellinoora
I fucking love Horkýže Slíže so much
Mocking the shit out of the German language is literally timeless humor
Oh Lord, that's some trashy pop
I was fortunate to turn it off soon enough
Fairly ubiquitous, even in rural areas
Only old dilapidated buildings don't have these
I just recently started watching his videos
I'm not even into trucks or driving for that matter but his videos are extremely relaxing and satisfying to watch
PPPiter is actually pretty good
PPPeter
PPPeter i just really like his style of comedy he talks about the countries he visited and everyday things like glasses Gyms Schools etc
"pppEter" - for international audience (as he has different accounts for czechoslovakia and rest of the world)
And he is probably the only one better known yet not annoying slovak youtuber
There is actually a polish youtuber living in north korea if i am not misstaken, but i dont remember the name
It depends
With people we see reguraly we usually greet each other without physical contact
However, if you were waiting someone arriving (like at an airport) or saying farewel for a longer time, a handshake is more common
I am a cat person in a dog country
Don't get me wrong I love dogs
They ate just a bit more needy than cats
I like how cant can take care of themselves
Plus their personality is like mine
Rusyn language
[Goral] and [Rusyn] are the first ones which come to my mind
There is also Hungarian and Roma language, but those should be relatively known ones
[Goral] and [Rusyn] are the first ones which come to my mind
There is also Hungarian and Roma language, but those should be relatively known ones
[Goral] and [Rusyn] are the first ones which come to my mind
There is also Hungarian and Roma language, but those should be relatively known ones
[Goral] [Rusyn] and [Romani] are the first ones which come to my mind
Others are minority languages of nationalities who have their own country so that shouldn't count as "lesser known".
Absolutely not
In my village we can use the bus and the train to go to the closest town, which is also connected directly to the capital by bus and train
Nope
Sometimes I get angry when I cant take both skis and snowboard when I go skiing, because I take a bus to the resort or a train, but thats it
I lived in a capital city and definitely never wanted to have a car there
Its sometimes needed in rural areas as usual, but I get by without a problem
OK this may have led to me being scared of driving, because never really gotten into it, because I moved to the capital city as soon as I got my licence
What's the state public transport in the US
I always see in movies and other things that you have a strong car culture and it's really a neccesity
In bigger cities you have public transport cards that you pay for monthly, you just need to have it with you in the case of control
If not, you can buy tickets from machines (pay in cash or debit card), or from the driver (that is not recommended, only for a last minute purchase)
Between the cities and in villages you usually pay in cash or use a top up card specific to the bus company of your choice
Slovak Lines will have a different card from Arriva and so on
When it comes to trains, depending on the location, you can use the same card as on the buses (city specific card of Bratislava, for example), but you need to have it activated for the zones you pass through I think
Otherwise you pay in cash for a one-time, weekly or monthly ticket
Sometimes you can even pay online, using an app or a site, but these sites are usually a bit clunky in my opinion (except for RegioJet, which works, but it's just badly designed)
Syr
Or rather syyyyyr
Which is literally just cheese
We produce most cars per capita in the world, and around 26% of our whole industry is dedicated to production of cars and car parts
Well and thats tragic, in my point of view
Volkswagen, KIA, Peugeot Citroen and Jaguar Land Rover
There is, however, only one car company native to Slovakia: K-1 Engineering, which produces hand-made luxury sport cars
Ice Hokey for us, even though violence is way less common than for football
Mainly when we play against each other ;)
Goddamn 20th century !
It’s shame that it always ends with WW2 and 50s and the rest is just quickly said
80s and 90s were also important in terms of how our country looks today
But whatever, I think people don’t care much about the history
And I find it sad
Edit: grammar
Lol, “only” 5k...
Not quite the experience, but I was listening to a radio one evening with my father in his car on our way home when I was 16 and the radio station started playing the song 'Rape Me' by Nirvana
Let's say that I was quite surprised to see my father nonchalantly singing the lyrics, even though he didn't know their meaning and translation, because he doesn't speak English at all
Mine has changed very much, to the point that I can no longer listen to some new pop songs, which is a bummer because then I am no longer able to dance on them on the parties
Breivik has joined the chat
Dunno, I used to go each month for half a year so I get my teeth fixed up, now I go when they start to hurt, I get them done and maybe some cleaning or whatever
Its not really a matter here, there are plenty of them to choose from, you can book any day any time you want and they are not very expensive either
Everything is very convenient in terms of dental care here
In Slovakia, if you don't go for a check-up, the next year your healthcare insurance for dental will be void
meaning you will have to pay the full price for implants and such
Still, quite a lot of people don't go, there are official statistics somewhere
Also, there is a difference between dental hygiene and dentist
In the past the dental hygiene was less common, nowadays it's becoming more recognised
People usually go once a year
The crappy thing is, it's considered a premium healthcare, so not every insurance covers it and some employers even don't accept the pardon for work absence, because it's not a doctor
it's a legal definition thing
Well yes, insurance does not cover much from private dentists, so most of the people just meh´s it
I didn’t go to dentist for my whole college so my first year after that I didn’t have insurance
The difference between filling cost was 20€ without insurance and 16€ with lul
It reaaaaaly depends on what culture they are coming from
With integration - obviously europans have it easier, then westerners, than russians etc
the further from central european christian valued slavic countries, the harder the integrating
But that makes pretty much a lot of sense
To the second question, it really depends on when they come from
Switzerland, norway, canada, australia, new zealand - perfect
japan, south korea, singapore, vietnam (strangely enough)
- not a single problem
Balkan, eastern european countries (non eu members), usa - okay but a bit suspicious
Russia, latin america - worse
turkey, iran, middle asia, india, china
- much worse
most of africa - bad
arabs or pakistani - very bad
Why Korea
I find this interesting
Its the drinking and sheep
Honestly
People know very little about Slovenia in general
But everything they know seems be positive
"You know, we are not that different you and i". I would say if it comes to this judging, you are at top of the list, to the point it's not even being viewed as positive (like this kind of "positive discriminaton" in the case with Swiss for example) but as one of us, so like Czechs, polish
Which is the closest you can get
So almost like brothers
I think the outlook on Slovenia is definitely the most positive from all of the "Balkans", and it's among Czechs, poles, Austrians
Because from we see you are even more like us than Czechs which is a brother nation, in some cases
If you picked a Slovak a put him somewhere in Slovenia, if people were not taking, he wouldn't know he is in a different country
Because let's be honest here for a moment - it's not a different country, it's just a trick we play on Hungary and Austria
Maybe you should check
Interesting
Because over here over the border, the attitude is very different
People from East Asia would be welcomed (except for Chinese)
Because they are seen as polite, hard working and causing no troubles
Maybe because the biggest non European minority in those countries (Slovakia, Czechia, Poland) is Vietnamese
And they cause no trouble even though they are not fully integrated into society
Even Chinese could be okay, but people would be way more suspicious
Its interesting actually
From my experience in uk or france, I thought that Muslim women are actually treated nicer
Mostly because lot of people kinda put them into the victim category
Which is a bit patronising
So they were treated much better than men, who are often viewed a bit skeptically
Because they get associated with bad issues in the religion
But I do agree that you generally draw attention outdoors
Especially as blond tall person
With me and my blond coworker, there was always attention on us in Kenya/Tanzania
People were curious, wanted to talk
But unfortunately it felt like people automatically assumed we are super rich or something and often treated us as a cashcow
Like bartenders giving us higher tabs, people making us pay for their meals and stuff
What the hell is going on with vienna
[This one] is my favourite one - it means - be aware, there are slaves on the road
also "hlapec"(boy) and "jed"(poison) are the good ones
>Our reverse is "fukati" - though that might be with Czech, I'm not sure
But I hear it means sth like to blow air up there and here it's, well, straight from English
I know about this one, its similar here with "šukať". Which means "looking for" in polish, yet "to fuck" in slovak/czech
You can imagine my surprise as a kid watching polish tv, some movie for children with hulk hogan, when out of nowhere he claimed: "idzem pošukať dzieci" or something like that (i dont know how it is written in polish), which in slovak means: "i am going to fuck the children"
I have no idea
What about Ukrainian
They have few similar words
During cold months 3(sometimes 4) times per week, during summer pretty much every day
you need a very strong anti-dandruff shampoo for oily hair
i mean very strong as including some medicine - from the pharmacy
or at least one that includes zinc, salycile acid, nettle extract
You, Spaniards, actually use scissors in the kitchen for many things, not just to cut a pizza
My boyfriend is from Málaga and I’ve seen things like cutting the lettuce or other vegetables with scissors
It blew my mind, even though it completely makes sense, I mean, if it works it works
but before it’d never cross my mind to do that
Personally, in my family, for pizza we either use a pizza cutter or a fork and a sharp knife
That is literally the first time I hear about this
My personal favourite is Marcus Aurelius, the last of the five good emperors, and a stoic - I really liked his book (diary) - Meditations, part of which he has apparently written in the area of modern day Slovakia
What
Roman empire was ever under the rule of somebody else than Caesar
... Asterix lied to me
... also I dunno anybody else tbhh except maybe that Sula guy
Is roman empire that important part of history
Indeed, it was a shame, and yea, there were many emperors that had interesting lives
overall I find the whole Roman era very fascinating
Bratislava (440k), Košice (240k), Prešov (88k)
Bratislava- Well, capital city of Slovakia
I think its Luxembourg of central europe, because there are small population but there is a thousands more people who go for work there
Bratislava has very modern downtown
Košice- Its a metropole of east Slovakia
There is a tram system and nice old town, but then its here just plenty of communist barracks
Prešov- Oh, there are jokes of this ''city''. Many people call this city village
I was there and there is nothing to do
I walked old town in 30 minutes and there was nothing opened only one caffé. Then I wanted souvenir so I must go to the shopping center for one souvenir
There is also plenty of communist barracks, but they have very good public transport
Hey what do you say about Malaga, Santiago de Compostela and Bilbao
Are you from Brno by any chance
Freedom of choice and right to refuse doesn't say anything about freedom from consequences
People who are not vaccinated (with exception for people who with e.g. immunity diseases who cannot be vaccinated) should be quarantined or forbidden from accessing public places or forced to wear closed protective clothing with internal circulation of air
Yes, but it's very arbitrary and depends upon the person who translates the name
I've seen Margaret being translated as Margita (a typical name among elderly women), George to Juraj, Nicolas to Mikuláš, etc
Slovakia heard people were saying we were a third world country
Its actually nice to live here
Bratislava is definitely nothing like it was portrayed in the Eurotrip movie
Are you portrayed horrible
I always wanted to travel to baltics, you guys look so awesome
Plus only met the most amazing people from Latvia
And  Estonia
And my best friend studied IN Lithuania and she loved it
said the Eastern German
No, Felvidek (Upper Country)
Get your facts straight
The train station is such a shame, it should be the first priority in Bratislava to fix, yet nothing is happening
At least they did some minor renovations for hockey championships
Yeah, we hate that place too
There was a huge amount of real estate development since 2011 and still ongoing
Lots of high rises too in the new extended city centre near Eurovea, most of it will be completed in 1-2 years, but I expect it to continue for next 4-5 years
As for the vibe, its seasonal, the best vibe is during the summer days, and then additionally for a few weeks during Christmas
As the city does not offer many touristic attractions, it's really about the atmosphere, and that is best experienced with friends or with locals that know where and when to go
The city is also becoming quite international, last official stats talked about 8% foreigners living in the city, which is particularly experienced in the old town, where you hear foreign languages all the time
Plenty of foreign students as well
In the end, it's really down to what you're looking for from travelling
Some people go for sights, others for the vibe and local life experience
Being a local, I would definitely recommend you give it another shot again
Like i said in a different comment, Bratislaba is not for sight tourism as much as for experiencing the vibe, bars and laid back atmoshere
Glad you had a nice visit tough
As Bratiskava resident, where
Collect your internet points
Head over to r/slovakia before you come and ask for suggestions
We'll help out
What does it mean
Like someone brown skinned, or specifically from kaukaz
Try [Algor - Čas odplaty] for Slovakia
Not really metal, but the Finnish neofolk band Nest does use kantele as one of the main instruments
I recommend trying out the album Woodsmoke
The mentioned Amorphis does too I think, they even have an EP My Kantele, although kantele is not listed in the instruments played, but acoustic guitar
The acoustic version of My Kantele is phenomenal though
Let aside all I know, I wonder if I am the only one who's always felt Benelux would be a great name for a brand of lightbulbs
"Thank" is a verb and all verbs in Slovak (and I believe it's common for all Slavic languages) have different form based on who (1st, 2nd or 3rd person and sg
or pl
) is thanking
So for Slovak it is:
* I - ďakujem
* You (sg
),  - ďakuješ
* He/She/It - ďakuje
* We - ďakujeme
* You (pl
) - ďakujete
* They - ďakujú
How do you pronounce it
Not common but most of people dont care bout other peoples hairstyles
Usuaully what I hear :
Regular dark hair - Oh so you are into metal
Rasta braids - he does drugs
My opinion about long hair - Must be annoying to wash them
Of course Finland would say this
I used to go be around metal head guys in high school
And this was their biggest problem as they got older and started loosing hair
They were so heartbroken
But don't worry I am sure you still look good
Modlivka zelená - Modlit means to pray and zelená means green
Modlivka in Slovak
"Something (feminine) that prays"
But doesn't it make more sense the way we do it
I mean:
"What do you call praying mantis
"Oh, you know, just all those big green bugs doing that funny thing with their front legs and nothing else
In Soviet Russia, male mantis eats the female, apparently
And Mantis religious is Modlivka Zelená so green something that prays
I did think about the subject seriously, though, and I am puzzled if I am used to saying "how" only because it's a calque from my own language (where the sentence would cringe with the equivalent of "what"), or because I am constantly trying to mimic other people when speaking a foreign language and I am curious, *how* do they English properly, or because I have simply heard other people say "how" instead of what
Probably the last option holds
My pick would be Bocelli's Con Te Partiro
First it had my curiousity, and from the first line until the end it had my full attention
That we are East Europe
That we are Czechoslovakia
That we are Slovenia
Le Northern Hungary has arrived
Why wasn't it fair
Is it a guy you are married to by any chance
Yes I get that
I also understand that a lot of people is still used to pre-89 political classification of countries to Western and Eastern bloc
Well personally I'm not bothered by it as much
I simply inform them that we are somewhere in geographical center of the Europe
Anyway, Czechs got it even worse because many people consider Austria as Western Europe and Czechia as East Europe while Vienna is located way more east than Prague :D
We hanged Jozef Tiso and generally punished the rest
Government officials as president Jozef Tiso, ministers, leading party members, etc
were sentenced to death or to prison
However they weren’t the only ones participating and maintaining the regime
There were lot of people in party or in military organizations
One of typical stories from that era: report local Jews, aryanizate their property, after war change your coat to communist party and report anyone who would have enough courage to say anything against you
Of course it wasn’t only like this - but I wanted to give different view and that there wasn’t always true justice for those greedy people
Really
How were they punished
And "we" hanged Tiso
I don't really know, that's what I assume
Tiso was used by both Communists and democratic parties in 45 - 48 period, where some wanted his execution while others not so much
The execution alone was more of an political tool rather they justice served
Others weren't even punished that hard, [Šano Mach] for example got only 30 years of prison and was released after general pardon of 1968
More than I can possibly count
Just a few
I can see castle(well ruins) when I look out of the window, so I guess they weren't that super interesting
But than again I don't travel that much
Me and my brother were huge fans of medieval warfare and medieval time in general as kids, so our mom took us to a lot of castles and castle ruins pretty often
I've lost the count so far, but I guess it could be around 50 or 70, since we've visited some of them more than one time
You can't possibly go anywhere without passing at least one castle, castle ruin or chateau along the way here
So I lost count a long time ago :D
me too lol
Oh yes, that's probably the prettiest, most touristy, theme-park-like one that we have
Which reminds me, I still have to see Pony Park Slagharen
I am curious about it since the "America First, Netherlands Second" video
I believe it's inconclusive
I've heard that Wales has more, but noone knows what was considered as a castle when counting them there
If you count castle ruins too, it's very very likely
All credits go to Hungarian nobility, of course
Wales got more per mile, Belgium more per Kilometer, but Slovakia has most per capita
We were taught at school that most aristocracy in present-day Slovakia was ethnically Hungarian, or at least spoke Hungarian
It only makes me wonder, to what extend our separatism was a matter of language and to what extend it was a product of class struggle, actually
This is false
Most of the nobility in Slovakia was of a Slavic/Slovak origin
It was a huge problem in the early stages of monarchy since most of them didn't speak hungarian so communication with Hungarian nobility and the king was complicated
However, nationality didn't really play role till like 18th/19th century
Till then we were all Hungarians or more specifically inhabitants of Hungarian kingdom and nobody really cared what language you use
Just after then people started realize that we might be of a different ethnicity since we speak a very different language
Anyway, in late years of monarchy Slovak-speaking nobility was naturally shrinking
Also it didn't help when magyarization laws were implemented in 19th century which shrinked it even further, but it also empowered independance movements
"Najčistejšou" - "with the most pure" - comes to my mind, without too much thinking
It is very likely there is a word even shorter than that, but please, give me some credit, surely you all know how consonant-heavy west slavic languages are
Oh hi Mark
"Miešanou" - "with the mixed" - popped to my mind only a minute later
You see, we are not monsters, we can employ vowels if we want
"Eufória" can also be considered, but it is foreign
It's same sound
But by i/y you know, if you are talking in singular or plural
Pekní/pekný
Lol here it's not only normal, but mostly expected, especially on night lines
The situation you described is normal and I have seen it (and participated in singing) many times, especially when there is some festival or event taking place along the bus line
It's also common to see peple drinking while riding a bus, as I also did many times before with friends
Three of them come to mind: Slovak uprising against Hungary in 1840s (together with establishment of official Slovak language by Ľudovít Štúr and subsequent rise of Slovak national identity), the Treaty of Trianon when we finally broke from Hungarian chains and finally, official establishment of Slovak republic in 1993
I am officialy sorry for Babiš, guys
Grenadiermarsch, colloquially known as "granatír". Although I wouldn't say it's a popular food, because I am certainly not the only one who hates it with passion, but it's very frequently served in school cafeterias, hospitals and other public facilities
If I ever ended up on death row, I'd request it as my last meal, without pickles and along with Steiger 10° beer, to look forward to the execution
Anything with liver in it
Or meat with a lot of fat(mainly pork)
Also I won't eat anything else from chicken besides breasts
From veggies definitely borecole
We call it kel here and I especially dislike small variant called ružičkový kel
Yes, Aspic is the most disgusting thing I have ever tasted
Worse is that my family loves it and it stinks so fucking much when someone makes it
Tartar sauce is the best lol
yes
I didn’t like it in school canteen but made at home it can be quite tasty
Yes yes, it's a very military-grade dish
Anyway, if you ever pay a visit to Slovakia, I suggest to try bottled Steiger 10°, for similar reason tourists in Sweden try surströmming
S touto diskusiou stále v živej pamäti som sa práve odhodlal, po pätnástich rokoch granatír znova vyskúšať a trvám na tom, že aj [domáci] je presne tak hnusný, ako si ho pamätám zo školskej jedálne
Ajaj, *kdepak udělali soudruzi z NDR asi chybu
nemôžem za to, že očividne chabé prevedenie zničilo jedlo, ktoré môže byť tak chutné!
viac sa posnažiť treba ;) a poriadne domáce zaváraniny k tomu
Abstinence-shaming; lot of people make fun and shame people that don't drink
If you are abstinent and don't drink during some social event, lot of people make fun of you, that you are "weak" or "weird".
Just to reiterate how awesome and influential Skansen museum is, the Slovak word for any open-air museum is "Skanzen".
Not as common as McDonalds
In Bratislava, there are only 3 KFC restaurants (5 in the whole country), and only one of them has drive-through
Four restaurants in our country, two of them in the capital
Foreign restaurants of this type are rare at SK, since Mc is everywhere
KFC/Burger king/Panda express/Subway etc - rare spawns
We have one too, organized by a state company but i dont know anyone who cares about it (or even knows about it)
We have a scratchcard “Christmas Lottery” here in Slovakia
3M tickets printed, 7€ per ticket
432k tickets win 7€, 485k tickets win more, highest price is 150000€. It’s almost 1:6 chance to win something but the jackpot is 1 in a million and nothing extra
Hmm what is your price
I had my hopes for Istanbul, thought it would be more secular, given its history
Lol, anyway, very interesting, thanks for the info
Best of luck to you guys there
Stray dogs - only in Roma slums, it's quite problematic

Not really
There was just a short lesson explaining the dialects and the differences between them
Sadly, our language is standardized to death in our educational system and any dialectal influences are frowned upon
I wouldn't speak in a dialect in public simply because it's been considered wrong and uneducated in the past century
In many European countries we hear these big words about preserving our cultural heritage but it apparently doesn't apply to everything
For how small we are, you would believe how many dialects we have, some are just different pronunciations but some are entirely different words and sentence sequences, like holy shit I myself know like 15 ways of saying a "potato" in slovak
No we only have one literary Slovak language at schools that said we have foreign schools with foreign languages as main language of course
I'll be damned if I speak with anything other than the Trnavan dialect
Well, regional dialects in Slovakia usually differ much more from standard Slovak than standard Czech from colloquial Czech
Moreover, there's no omnipresent colloquial variant (even though some features like Ľ>L are widespread)
I'm not a linguist so someone may give a more scientific view on this
>I wouldn't speak in a dialect in public
I meant generally speaking outside of a group people I'm familiar with, for example in a shop / restaurant / at work in a different city / region or at school
I am gonna go with avocado plus italian cheese

Apparently, our government is considering a ban of plastic bags

They didn't. The ban is only on single use plastics by 2021 (straws, utensils etc

Austria - Vienna
Mainly because it's an awesome city
Austria has the Euro, both countries have awesome nature
And I would be close to my home - Bratislava, which is just an hour drive away
Austria, cause it's right behind the corner
Switzerland doesn't.
The route I take to visit my parents is 5
80€ for 50 minutes (90km) on a EuroCity train (highest quality train in Slovakia, cause it’s actually a Czech trainset going from Prague to Budapest)
Cross country Bratislava - Kosice (440km) regular “fast train” (5h50) costs 18

If I wasn't interested I simply downloaded some summary on the net and read that or watched a movie/theatre adaptation if available
Working with Germans, some of them use the word "Rechner" while in school I was taught it should be Computer
Woah, I went there for badely a week and I've heard more honking than in a year in Slovakia
My friends and me took a small bus from Ciampino to the center and holy fuck the ride was an adventure, missing parked cars by centimetres

I say no, the fuck what, that is not okay at all and never will be
Made me terrified
Yes, Europe is great
I would probably consider myself an upper middle class but not that much
20yo M, living in the capital Bratislava
Avg income in Slovakia is about 1000 €, avg in capital Bratislava is about 1600 €. The regional differences are there in Slovakia, the west is a pretty wealthy area, even considered to be the 3rd richest region in Europe – which upsets the east greatly
The easterners will tell you that Bratislava is a different country and it is a bit, but it's not like other people have no money or no saving to a higher degree than any other European country,
I make around 1700-1800 €, my expenses are around 1000 €, investing 500 € each month and the rest keeping in basic account for vacations, crazy nights or other non-covid sorcery
Slovakia is the equalest place on earth (no joke actually) as such I never felt it, but people here tend to not go bankrupt often

That's not EC but Eurostat, which is a EU statistical research organ

Try the bands Lasten Hautausmaa and Teksti-tv 666 my dude
They are pretty mainstream
Then there are weird ones like KAUAN (russian post-metal in finnish) or Vesta (synthpop)
we could eventually do a culture exchange with non-European countries, too
Depends, if it's Czechia then it's alright, but if it's Hungary
Who is considered the closest neighbor to Hungary
Austria

Andrej Babiš is Slovak *(even though in denial)* and is currently prime minister of the Czech Republic, which means both countries are run by Slovaks now
*(In general, most of the time, Czechoslovakia was run by Czechs, or at least thats what many Slovaks believed
When I was a kid, I didn’t know that not all counties in Europe are also in the European Union
I remember being sure that Janosik is our own tradition, imagine my surprise when I found out Poles consider Janosik theirs :(
Also Tatry, I didn’t realise they’re on the borders, so there is also the Polish side of them
I personally am surprised by the larger amount of bisexuals compared to homosexuals, it's the opposite usually

You thank ... the bus
For getting you to the destination or ... ? I mean it sounds cute but we definitely dont talk to inanimate object ... apart from phones
Sorry to interrupt, but for example here the public transport in cities works the same way, you can get on the bus by whichever door you want and just sit down or stand and get off whenever you want
Obviously, you need to have either a prepaid card or a ticket for X minutes
Every now and then a ticket inspector comes and controls everyone, and if you travel without a ticket, gotta pay a 50€ fine
[This] is a typical bus in Bratislava, as you can see there's a lot of doors to choose from
And they have a few movies now
In slovakia we use the word šukať means fuck in polish it means find

the other way round

Vasiľ Biľak
Invited Warsaw pact tanks to shut down the Prague Spring of 1968
Hailed as a hero by the Russian media
On the flipside, Jan Žižka and other hussites were religious fanatics that wanted a theocatic government, not unlike ISIS
However, Czechs do not like this comparison for some reason
I don't want my language to survive
I don't like it
Better be rid of it
Not worried
I actually do hope, that one time, English will eradicate other languages, including my native one
No, not at all
People can speak English more often, but their English isn't at a high level when speaking
Also, I don't mind that works are more commonly in English instead of the native language
Different languages have different features and can be better used in different situations, like some languages are genderless and using them can intentionally obscure a detail in the work
Also, writing in English means your work has a much larger reach and can become more successful and affect your career choice if you want to be a writer, actor, streamer/youtuber and a multitude of other things that are affected by the language you use
> I dont see any good reason to have months named differently then rest of the world
Yeah, that one's strange
I didn't learn all Czech names for months until I was maybe 23
It's just needlessly complicated
Zbojníci - in later medieval and early modern era, zbojníci were bandits that robbed travellers and merchants on roads going through remote areas of today's Slovakia, while using deep forest and challenging terrain to evade the law
I was 28 y.o. when I was first explained, by an American, where does the word "beťár", meaning a trickster, come from
> Also connected to Slovaks as well
In Slovak, we call them Zbojníci, which is in Slovak language basically word for bandits
There is also word "beťár" which is a word to describe bad and wrong-behaving child
Wait, I am sure there is a Czech song about them
Now that you say this, our word for a bridge is "most" and since I've learned English, I feel it would be very correct to refer to tunnels as "lísts".

Slovakia - Central Europe
People from Western Europe say that we are eastern Europe, because Europe was split for 40 years by Iron curtain
It ended 30 years ago and since then countries in V4 were developing in different direction that Russia, Ukraine or Belarus
Even before socialism, they were influenced much more by Germans than Russians
Therefore is seem logical to me to consider these countries a separate region and not part of eastern Europe
Nah, we're still Eastern Europe
Yup
And guests should too

It's more common for people who have their own (mostly in villages)
In cities it's less common than chicken, pork and beef, but it's still that one meat we sometimes eat
Dick breast, interesting
Czech Republic and Slovakia
That’s such utter bull crap
We are extremely close, I have very little common with Poles, Ukrainians, Austrians, or Hungarians, but Czechs are a brother nation
We share a common history (of over 70 years), traditions, culture, food, etc
My dad is Czech, my mom is Slovak, I have both citizenships and to say that we have no similarity is so very nuts
Seriously, we watch the same movie during Christmas, like the same sports, eat the same food, drink the same alcohol, understand each other, listen to similar music
You’re telling me a German will have svíčková for Sunday lunch, bake some koláče to take over to their neighbors for the afternoon visit which they will drink slivovica during, while watching some Hrebejk movie
Dude
I honestly do not know how to reply - your life experience seems so extremely foreign to the one of my friends and family, from both countries
I will not take the time to go point by point, simply because this whole thing is seemingly highly subjective, and it makes no sense to try to persuade you that your own experience is invalid, when it is clearly not
I am extremely confused about how adamant you are about the differences you perceive
Whenever I am in Czech Republic, I feel like I am home
I can't say that about any other country in the world (including the US, where I've lived significantly longer than I have ever spent in Czech Republic)
Ultimately, I am happy we have split, primarily due to the political development in the region
Poland, Hungary, and partially you guys, have lost the independence of media which has lead to highly corrupted governments with authoritarian tendencies (primarily in Poland and Hungary), while Slovakia goes through a rebirth of liberal democracy and civic society started by a heinous murder Jan Kuciak
I will take Zuzana as a president over Zeman any day
And our opposition (with Progressive Slovakia as the leading party) over yours
It is a competition

Biological nature of beings = get the healthiest and the prettiest partner to reproduce with, which works both ways not just the male->female way
That's why people work out, take care of themselves, so they can pick from the best, highten their chances
Yes, it's misogynistic, but it also isn't at the same time
It really depends on how you're willing to perceive it - from the scientific, biological-evolutionary point, or from the point of a person who is outraged by words
Indeed
I don't know what's the point here but I agree with you
We have three major groups of ethnical minorities with their own language: Hungarians, Romani and Rusyn
Most of them speak their own language among themselves and only speak Slovak when talking to Slovak people
[Imrich Karvaš] the governor of the central bank of the short-lived Slovak state during WWII
He secretly collaborated with dissent underground movement, preparing an uprising against the nazi-aligned puppet government led by Jozef Tiso
In 1944, on his authority, about 3B Slovak crowns (present value about $750M) were transferred from the central deposit in Bratislava to the branch of the bank in the town of Banská Bystrica, which was about to become the main base of the insurgents, formally justifying the decision with concerns about the possibility of allied bombing of the capital
When the uprising broke out, the armed insurgents simply seized the money and were able to purchase the loyality of common people living in the region
The street in Bratislava where the seat of the central bank is located now is named after him
I mean, beat that, Salvadors Dalís!
I didn't know that
Very good comment
Capital city has probably the best international options for obvious reasons
Other cities might be a bit more limited, but bigger cities will still offer some international options and sometimes even quite unique or unexpected ones (e.g. opened by some former foreigner who moved here)
For example, there are Korean restaurants in Žilina because there is KIA factory (Korean car producer) and due to that small Korean community lives in the city
Slovakia is not a popular country for migration due to lower living standards compared to e.g. Germany so exotic restaurants are still considered rare and/or unique outside of capital
What is pretty common are Chinese/Asian restaurants
Those rarely offer authentic Chinese food tho
In bigger cities it's common to find also Sushi restaurants and Indian restaurants
Those tend to be more authentic
Kebab fastfoods are pretty common as well
Otherwise it's more or less standard Slovak and Czech cuisine with a lot of European influence and food
Italian restaurants are pretty common as well
Also there is a lot of restaurants without focus on a cuisine of a specific nation or region and instead they offer wider variety of foods
Generally just European foods tho but it's possible to find some exotic ones offered as well
As a citizen of Playoff winner B, I think we have a chance for the 2nd spot
Just asking, who's the last team England lost to recently
Probably the widespread ignorance towards certain issues
Ignorance towards the corruption in our country, EU politics and politics in general, social issues (racism, homophobia, etc
), global issues (global warming and ecological problems in general), health (there's a rather high rate of obese people- we ranked 7th in the EU, as far as I know), ignorance towards the other people (most noticeable on the roads and in the streets),...
A lot of people here have this way of thinking:' As long as it doesn't happen to me or my family, who cares
'. This can be applied to the things I mentioned as well
Simply put, people often don't give a flying fuck about certain things and love to live in their little bubble, but this is a problem not exclusive to only Slovakia
Lol, nope never
Biggest city, relative close to Wien
Its already function as capital of Slovakia
Also there Austrian royal jewelry
Slovak expressions are pretty boring
Basically just:
Mám to v piči/I have it in my cunt
Mám to u riti/I have it by my ass
Mám to v piči - lit
I have it in vagina
Said by both genders
Mám na háku  - lit
I have it on hook
Je mi to 1/5 - lit
It's one/five for me
Mám to u riti - lit
I have it by my side(buttocks)
In Slovak we have 'Je mi to ukradnuté' which would translate to 'It is stolen to me', but it actually meant 'I really don't care' in a not very friendly fashion
Well, more polite one is "Je mi to jedno". Literally translated "It's the one to me", but more semantically translated "It's all the same to me".
Yeah but everyone uses it only with their parents

Czech president Milos Zeman is also famous to smoke in non-smoking environments
There's a scene after his first presidential victory where inside Czech Public TV (non-smoking building) asks the general director directly where is the "ashtray", so he has to find some and the president just lights up a cigarette
Other time the Czech state had to pay for cleaning a non-smoking hotel room etc
He famously said, if you start smoking after your 20's it will be not damaging to your health

that definitely wouldn't spill over to Ukraine, nope
So, is there any context to this photo or evidence that he was actually performing the nazi salute ? Because throwing someone under the bus just because of a still image doesn't seem fair, Like that photo of prince William where it looks like he's giving someone the middle finger
I mean this guy might be a nazi for all I know but the fact is that we don't know and we shouldn't just assume this from one picture
what I see in his face is the eternal disappointment in the unfairness of the life in that he is ugly and never has gotten much pussy
So he is sticking out in his own retarded way
How clueless can you get
that never ceases to amaze me
Lobotomized dickhead with speech impairment Kotleba is another example of an imbecile misinterpreting history
But what I really worry about is how the fuck he got into the power
The russian money didn't do it on it's own, he had to have enough votes
The whole former soviet block is turning nazi
Oh the irony
To be honest, seeing photos of people doing the nazi salute is a bit iffy, it can just be a coincidence or the photo was taken just at the right time when his hand was in that position
But also he can just be a nazi, point is that photos are not really good evidence for this kind of thing without context
Goddamn patriots, they ruined patriotism
Jokes aside, I completely understand what you're saying
I love the idea of being proud of your country, since Europe is so beautifully diverse and we should be happy about what each of our countries has to offer; however, it's apparently too easy to slide into the toxic nationalism coupled with xenophobic views
I mean, yeah, he's probably a nazi, Im just saying that you can't know that for sure from a photo out of context
I don't see what's wrong with having evidence before passing judgement ?
No, I don't think I will
As a German you should know that that is not a proper nazi salute, also I never said that he is not a nazi, most likely he is, I just said that a still image like this is not evidence
Roght, so [Hilary Clinton] is also a Nazi ? Or [Bernie Sanders] ? Or [Hilary] again, or [this girl] ?
If you haven't noticed I also said that this guy is most likely and nazi, my personal opinion is that people like that should be sent in front of a firing squad
Think again
You already have enough Serbs and Ukrainians and they aren't exactly nice neighbours
Boris is really dragging down the dignity of that scene
This is just sad
Macron won
Dont seem like his plan is to piss off Scots red-face
our country is slowly upgrading speed of our trains as threy are popular amongst sudents as they get them for free
the big problrm i see is lack of connection to wanted destination . f.e. vacarion visits . good legislation wont hurt eithet so you have to pay fees for each country individually
How is it attractive when it takes so long and plane tickets cost under 100€
Stayed the same: shitshow before corona, shitshow after corona
Possibly Trump's stance on WHO was sympathetic to many people
What actually happened why there was lack of food in Amsterdam ?
Edit
I have checked the reason so now I know it was due to German occupation,
I have never known that Germans occupied German speaking countries, seems weird to me
love from slovakia our Slavic brothers, hopefully entire europe will soon prosper together
If I understand this correctly, he will be president for another 3 years
So what do you mean that he has fallen
Also, if he is not pro-EU and pro-NATO, how come Montenegro joined NATO recently
Fuckin' ell this is a proper revolution alright
[Or just 1977
Oh yeah our ones are just straight up killed
Slovakia
How
Those are politicians sentenced for crimes of sedition and/or embezzlement
Their guilt in these crimes was proven beyond any reasonable doubt
In fact, we could see them committing most of these crimes on TV
Now, maybe you don't agree that these acts should be considered criminal, and that's OK (although I'm not aware of any country in the world that doesn't criminalise sedition)
Campaign to change the law
But to equate that with people being put behind bars for informing people on what those who hold power do with it is a giant display of ignorance, and frankly, laughable
Your logic here seems to be "I don't like it, therefore it's the same".
Can't say I support that kind of lack of nuance
Anything can be political under the right circumstances, even having an abortion
How does it relate to the map though
interestingly
loud music seem to always feature rap or something "cool"
never have I ever heard someone blasting wham
Drove around Poland for a holiday, can confirm
Poland is the only place I've seen wakie-talkies used in order to know where the police are and therefore be confident of not getting a ticket for
spectacular driving
Coincidentally, it was also the place where traffic jams resulting from accidents seemed to be the most common
WHat does this even mean
EU is not 1 country
Each country has their own ISPs and lobby
We have nothing to brag about with these shitty mobile internet plans
Not yet
VIdeos, IPTV etc
would stop working
We used to have it here completely reversed
It worked only with mobile internet and you got a basic package of, say, 1GB data and operator offfered these packages of social networks or whatever as extra for extra charge
Phased out currently because no one gave a shit and no one wanted it
This looks totally like Bratislava, except for a few minor differences
The southern part and the old town fit perfectly, even the bridges (there are more now)
Looks like Bratislava, just train station is in the wrong place
Ok guys next time simply write it's a Bratislava
This is absolutely not Bratislava
This looks extremely like Bratislava, with a few minor differences
WTF, why do all these people do is want to ban something then less and less people do
We have few morons like this is parliament too and they put the same law every 6 months
If failed 2 times so far, but I bet it gets trough eventually
This week it only failed by 1 vote
Well, we have histories of the countries "liberated" by USSR to evaluate the validity of that statement
Dont panik
Our great nation safestest
I posted meme here and it got removed fml
Ah yes, my beautiful nation
yeah except they've tested 1375 people
The karma gods work in mysterious ways
They  said it was low effort :(
It was another meme
but it prolly was low effort lol
i know it's a joke, but the joke is that the picture overexaggerates the fact that only so few cases are confirmed because they tested only a small sample
but do you honestly think 1375 people is a small sample
63 infected, that means that only around 4% of people tested were positive
come on now
and this information is on r/europe because
Honestly, it's the same as always
Whichever side won, it will still lead to them acting like smug children, as if they obliterated the other side in a landslide victory, even though that isn't the case
Biden won by an incredibly thin margin and that just goes to show how many fans Trump and the Republicans have in the US
No matter whose ass is in the chair, their country is split down the middle by two sides that seem to absolutely hate each other and consider the other side as a bunch of morons
Right now, it seems they would rather watch their entire country burn than to cooperate on anything because the tribalism is just so strong
Biden or trump, what is the difference
Seriously
I just wished he has chosen someone else for vice president
He will be nicer to china - which is probably not good, nicer to environmnet which is probably good (however considering the covid economy aftermath, i dont know about that) and i hope it will calm down american people a bit, and the division will become narrower
Other than that - two old dudes, quite similar honestly, and biden will be easier to push around, i am afraid
What i am interested in however is, what are going to do all the people who built up their careers on hating trump
Are they going to change their careers or what
What about those celebrities mocking trump in their shows
Are they going to switch to full on propaganda and celebrate the glorious leader or are they going to mock biden now, or are they going to just disappear
So what
The media don´t swear in presidents the courts do
We call it "bag of potatoes" over here
We had few "bag of potatoes" presidents over here
I mean, if they retain control of the Senate and Mitch does nothing for the next two years, that sentiment kinda stands
Is there any argument
Why is this straight up stupid
I think this partisanship is straight up stupid
From outside it literally looks like some tribal wars in africa
They are not that different from outside
Typical partisanship
That's so weird
If you think of biden as some kind of Messiah, you are going to be disappointed
He is politician for quite some time
They are similar
Two way too old men with history of lying and abusing people around them, history of corruption etc
One is more lunatic the other one more baked into the system
It literally looks silly from outside
Maybe I am missing something, but to me it looks similar
And your agreement is the argument of "because I love him
People started wearing it like that here too after it got hot
Omg I can not believe Americans are so stupid when it comes to Geography
> Like why is the map angled this way
3 D
Didn't he do this more times
u/savevideo
Even Hitler was
This is kinda sad
Ah yes, the flat-lands
I ask the same thing whenever people post Turkey here, at least in Norilsk majority of citizens are European, Turks have nothing to do with Europe except for tiny stolen land
> ~~Identity~~ politics is a cancer upon society
FTFY
LOL, out of all countries, Poland and Hungary are the ones to think USA is doing fine the most
What a coincidence
Interesting how conservative countries think it works well just because it's the only it's the only way for conservatives in US to win the election
Hungary and Poland think US is just ... makes you wonder how fucked up their government must be
Poland and Hungary
That says a lot
Checks and balances work well, the 2 party system is the problem
Eastern Europe looks favourably at USA for two reasons
First is, that our governments are extremely corrupt, so the US system doesn't look as bad relatively to ours like it is to the western Europe
The second is, that Eastern Europeans see the USA as a country that managed to economically snap the Soviet Unions neck
If you ask here anyone who is their favourite US president, the vast majority will tell you it is Ronald Reagan
&#x200B;
It has nothing to do with Poland and Hungary, or their current governments
You will get similar answers everywhere east of the Berlin wall
> Biden has a president and Trump as a vice, which is how it originally was
what are you talking about please
Thats a bridge
That does not look safe
Yes, they are
Not like neonazis in Bratislava or stupid people in Prague week ago
Fucking eliminated oh my god
I also don't have it for some reason, and my younger sister does
No idea why
Love the tag
Is this what you call swine fever
Female boar with piglets
If you corner it, it will fuck you up
Slovakia has one of these too
There was a public competition in 2008 what will be the common design for a coin commemorating 10 years of EMU
If I remember correctly, it was leaked that this design was made by a Greek which caused rather massive mobilisation of Greeks to vote for this rather underwhelming design
If it weren't for the leak, this design wouldn't probably win
I've red UWU at the bottom
I used to collect these few years back
I will always think about my grandma which used to show me these whenever she found some
Didnt every country had this stickman euro coin
Im fairly sure I have a few from Slovakia and Austria
I've got one of those
That makes sense
The more you know
Sure, I used to collect them
I don't anymore, as there is so many of them that it's unbearable
This would make a badass rocket league arena
Remember to participate in the EU elections this weekend and try to find candidates that support your requests
It's the best opportunity to push things forward that we'll have in the next 5 years
it does
there is a straight line through all the city
In terms of practical action, Slovakia is finishing up another block of nuclear reactors right now; after it goes into operation, our electrical grid should be over 80% covered by carbon-clean energy
In about 4 years, we also plan to shut down the largest coal-fired power plant in the country
Thanks to energy saving lamps and better insulated "passive" housing projects, the electricity consumption per capita is going down as well, so hopefully we are on a right track
i sincerely hope this isn't supposed to be a reference to her song
motherf
I think it's really ironic to say this here considering the frequent censoring in many subreddits
I work for a company which deals with flights
Lets say that my fantasies now consist of burning drones alive
In my country they are proposing, or already made law that to operate drone you need security clearance
And fines is like 30k €, Which is fucking ridiculous as it would made all drones no usable, for media, videos clips anything,
I'm in this picture and I don't like it
Slovak parliament:
**Coalition:**
32% - corrupt social democracy
10% - highly corrupt nationalist semi-christian social democrats
9% - hungarians corrupted by the two fuckers above
**Opposition**
5% - Sensible right-wing libertarians
8% misc anti-centralization, usually center-right, politicians
6% center right traditionalist anti-corruption party, though a bit shady
&#x200B;
5% - Corrupt and unsophisticated far-right overt 1488ers, nobody wants anything to have with them
15% - uncategorized, most of them left some of the coalition and opposition parties since 2016
In ideal world
Mostly the coalition just agrees to do whatever the most powerful wants
I remember having close to 30 parties in one election couple years back in our small Slovakia
Yes, our clown(in a middle of a cabinet crisis) was there too
Did he move around like R2-D2
Rest in peace
The title literally brought tears to my eyes omg
Ah shit, here we go again
Remember to vote next year and get the cunts who voted yes out of there
Congrats
Why should a better team lose
Fuck you
No you
Ohh the Soviet Union offered to deliver a million men into Poland and people weren't interested
Imagine that, considering how well their intervention to help save Poland (but actually to murder its intelligentsia and carve it up) went a year later
Had the Soviets wanted safety, they would've allowed for the Polish army to be reinforced from the south east as the allies planned to
But instead they wanted to control Polish territory and manpower, so they decided to invade Poland under a false pretense of offering help and murder the elite
I struggle to see the basis for your assumption that the offer was made in good faith, considering how many times Stalin betrayed his word (especially to the Poles)
> have you forgotten that they took part in carving up your country after Munich
I have not
I'm just not letting that cloud my judgment enough to expect the Polish to give up their sovereignty on something as completely worthless as Stalin's word
Besides, what they took is nothing compared to the lasting damage USSR did after turning my country into a de facto colony
If it isn't my favorite MH17 denier, /u/Glideer, finding solace in alternative history where Stalin got to occupy Poland a year sooner and everything was fine and dandy
The Polish practically gave Stalin no choice but to enslave their nation by refusing to be enslaved
Sure
Wait wait wait, are you not denying that MH17 was shot down with a BUK belonging to Russian armed forces anymore
Have you stopped lying about that
OK, I see your hot take on alternative history based on pure conjecture (well, and an unwavering servility to the interests of the Russian state) and raise
USSR roles over Poland and the whole world sees it's amazing and acknowledges Stalin for its father and leader
We live happily ever after, as the whole Soviet sphere of influence did under Stalin
As such, we finally deserve to be admitted into the intergalactic federation of planets and are awarded devices of FTL travel and half-life 3
Those damn Poles
Why don't you go with this next time
Calling liars out on their lies isn't paranoia
But I get it that branding dissenters mentally ill is a time-verified Soviet staple
Who shot down MH17 using what equipment
It shows how fragile we are
And i honestly thought nothing worse could happen to innocent people this year

I love how Slovakia is how do I train a cat but if you look little left it’s how do I star in pornos

Everybody is laughing at us now, but we will laugh when our supreme cat army conquers the world
I'm Slovak and only search on english
No point searching in Slovak for anything
There are some regular flights going to Bratislava airport (from London, Manchester, Edinburgh, Birmingham, Doublin, Kyev, Milan, Moscow, Rome, Sofia), but the best is to fly to Vienna Schwechat airport (has much more connections than BTS airport) and go to Bratislava by a bus or taxi (it's less than one hour journey from the airport - Schwechat airport serves both Vienna and Bratislava)
Hah thanks, why you think that
You are hereby promoted as a first lieutenant in our holy cat war

Fuck it I'm moving to Iceland
This color gradient is really odd
It's difficult to see the differences with the vast majority in the 30s being the red and the few 40s as the purple and the one clear 8
7 in Iceland
Those few extremes make it very monochromatic from 19 in Ireland to 30s in Greece
I would prolly kill myself if I were in France
It's 33C here and I'm wishing for a swift death already
30C+ inside, fan blasting from 30cm on me, yet I still feel like I'm slowly but surely dying
I climbed Kili few years back
I called it "week long steeper walk in the park". It's quite easy climb and the body would be 100 % recoverable
So easy and so nice
Interesting fact, Slovakia is the only EU nation without official Mosque, also islam is not officialy recognised as religion and we never had islam terrorists here
Let us prove that our religion is actually not hateful by stabbing people
Crusade 2
Let’s start with legalizing mocking of religion across Europe
It’s still illegal in a number of countries, e.g. Germany and Poland
A newspaper in Poland got a fine of 30000€ for posting caricature of Jesus 2 years ago
Most countries are not united in their values and traditions
There are huge differences between urban and rural areas, different corners of the same country, minorities that have been in the country for hundreds of years, ....
E.g. I live in Slovakia which can be considered a small country (5
5mil people) and even here there are huge differences between people from the capital, from the South, from the Northwest and East
Differences in traditions, cuisine, religiosity, even language
If we wanted to separate countries on the basis of values and tradition we would need at least 5 times the amount of countries here in Europe, probably a lot more
Slovakia, perhaps Czechia
I think other muslim countries shitting on France right now does not help, they are basically siding with the terrorist
ummm
missed couple kids, didn't they
cool, but not cool

Why are so many people surprised that there is Tesco in Slovakia
So in Bratislava are those taxi called VB that uses the same paint style as old communist police (verejná bezpečnosť)
I've heard they cause uneasy feelings to some older folks
I can imagine one of them walking out of that tesco with empty shelves, then seeing the orange-white police car and must have thought: fuck this shit, I am out of here
Finally  I'm proud of my country
People are asking what customers can do in response
Buy local and ethically collected honey
Here in Slovakia it is easy to purchase locally collected and produced honey, I know this isn’t true everywhere, but it is a huge step from the companies that replace the honey taken from bees with sugar water to make as large of a profit as possible
My granddad told me that he sometimes instinctively slows down when he sees one of those VB taxis while driving
How is bees dying political lmao
Transported to gulag in 3
We didn't. Don't trust Chinese numbers

They dont want democratic elections lr they want
Are they protesting for or against democratic elections
Ok, this is epic
This does not look very safe from the covid side of things

The core of such army would have to be combined armies of France, Spain, Poland and Germany because the rest is too irrevelant, corrupt and poor or just Belgian like
Pretty cold today, shitty wind
Uniform weather is when it's the right time to wear an uniform
This really makes me uncomfortable as a person who absolutely despise hot temperatures
Wondering about a way to cool down properly during the inevitable 35+ summer, since the last one was absurdly hot
Dude I feel you, guess the skialp season is over
Feel the pain
It has been freezing in most of Central and Eastern Europe a week ago too, which is unsettling
Yeah it's not over
But lot of the snow melted, so you have to go higher up and I highly doubt that there will be more fresh powder this season
It was nearly 20° here this week
US is more like a rebellious kid that has a complicated relationship with his parents but deep inside he still loves them

Yes thats true
Due to conflicts in Great Moravia some Moravians moved to Balaton, then further south
As far as I know, Kocel - Pribinas son, is a historical persona in Slovenia
At Slovakia they are much biger and higher and we call ´em mountains
I was at the station exactly one year ago and it was quite chilling to think about what happened at that place not too long ago
It doesnt pay back debt in the first place
The bonds are funded from EU budget
Isnt France projecting some warships in that area of operations precisely to counter Erdogan
what the hell is going on with slovenia, you're tarnishing our reputation
Given German military trackrecord probably biggest help they can offer in there is by not sending anything
Google tells me that for slovak and czech it is derived from the english word of "fashion".
That more people attended protests against the US police system than protests against Islamic terrorism in their own fucking country

Your ability to connect things that don't make sense is very interesting
I like the thoughts of a mindless slug
Slovakia=Eastern Europe=racist=Donald Trump
So intelligent
A small mistake : Trzaskowski won in the Masovian Voivodeship
Fuck you -Czechoslovakia
I still can’t believe the honorable and virtuous British Empire flaked on an alliance with another European nation like that and swept it under the rug
That is completely unforgivable
Not only did they dishonor their promise to declare war, but they cut us up behind our backs and didn’t even invite us to the agreement that sealed the fate of our nation
And it was all in vain anyway, all it did was allow Germany to spiral out of control and consolidate enough strength to conquer continental Europe
Worst betrayal of modern European history in my opinion
This is what happens when you find a stranger in the Alps
Wait when you have Russian towels all over the Spain these tourists don’t leave so easily and quickly as German ones
But like all the other rules in Italy, they're pointless because everyone ignores them
Red in flag often represents courage, revolution, hardiness, blood, and/or valor
The sausages, a German classic
The yellow stands for beer, and the black stands for coal right
San Marino has agreement with ECB and even  minted some collectors euro coins
Kosovo is unilaterally using euro and doesn't have any agreement

I have never heard anyone say anything about spanish village in slovakia
I think we say it could be chinese
The idiomatic version of 'I don't understand this thing at all' in their language, like 'španělská vesnice' for you and me (and some of the Balkans, TIL)
I've been looking at it for 10 minutes
It's so beautiful

Hows the car starting
Those damn magyars couldn't just leave huh
Hi from slovakia
This happens in my town too
The store owners complained that their customers or them can't easily park
The solution was to permit only certain owners to park there (surprise surpsire, those were people with large expensive cars
Nah
Here it was weddings and holidays in croatia
Even when wedding celebrations were banned people went to Poland to have wedding parties
Stupidly silly
Even when they wanted to limit it for 30 people max
PM fought for more people
And now he blames other people for these numbers
I've been here couple of times and water was much colder than in Tučepi or Brela for example
Is this normal
Im really upset on the fact that some bright mind came with the idea of assasinating him
Like, could not they think that there will be retaliation
Life was bad before that but became much worser after the act and Heydrich was not really that important
Czech republic were less involved in axis "business" than France was
Hence the name protectorate
Slovaks "won" the victor's side by Slovak national uprising
I dont think something would be different in these affairs if heindrich assasination did not occur
Where did I see those rates before ?
I mean these photos are pretty bullshit because you can capture any moment and push narrative, but it's pretty funny
Don't kink-shame
Can You do a Slovak version too please
One satanist and they have polish fullhouse
Well it's a train, it has multiple doors

Yea, it's a train it has doors every few meters why would you stand close at 1 place,
How tf is this worse in slovakia than in hungary
Oh man i wonder when will it change
At Least people my generation(gen Z)seem to be more appcepting
So maybe in future

Slovakia goes so far that it won't even recognize gay marriage or civil union made in countries where it's legal

Is it really that bad and depressing how people say it is
I wouldn't mind if it was dark a couple of days
Here in Slovakia in winter it will get dark around 3pm in december
Can someone explain
Woah
It was kinda hot yesterday with 30C in my town, but today tempatures have decresed and its only 23C so that pretty chill
Good luck for everyone 30>
Same here
Looks nice
Experiencing major upvote envy for not sharing my photo of this from August
I think that kind of contrast is why they did it
Fusing the old with the new is a great idea, especially in Europe but it cant be made one
For if you decide on the new, you forget the old and you keep the old there is no new
This way you can get both and pay respects to the old while looking out for the new
V Česku už sneží?

Seriously, why aren't such progressive people as Danes protesting against animal cruelty
Or they just stag-vomit in Prague and make fun of poor Slavs and brag how superior they are
WTF are they even using minks for
EU should just ban it
What did his predecessor do
didn't even have to look at the flair to spot a fellow desolation dweller -"are you saying there was no corruption or crime involved
impossible
Why would you bother sitting if you get off after 2-3 stops
They have to submit it for approval
There have been cases when other countries had objections and the coins [had to be altered] or [not issued at all]
They also [tried to alter] our (Slovak) commemorative coin dedicated to saints Cyril and Methodius but we won that battle
>basically a requirement
This is incorrect
Some countries make no commemorative coins most of the time (typically Ireland, Cyprus, Netherlands, Austria), some make one a year (Slovakia, Spain), some make two (most of the rest)
All is perfectly fine, the member states are not required to make them unless it's a common issue (like 10 years of the Euro or 30 years of the EU flag)
Countries are allowed to change motives after 15 years
San Marino did this (to make profit ofc)
I hope it won't happen, Maltese coins are great
Well, you can
By voting
You could not during communism
Hitler didnt brought UK down
Brits did
Also, the money UK doesn't get back directly still goes to other countries which then raise and educate skilled workers who might then decide that UK is a better place where to pay their taxes
Austria, Sweden, France and Slovakia are the best
Slovakia so nuclear
Slovakia is just lesser france
if you gain tons of money by working online, for belgian money while working in belarus, that's a pretty nice boost in everything, plus clearly he did it for his wife as well
there's this british CS:GO commentator who moved to Ukraine with his wife and lives there, so it's not like it doesn't happen or that it's always nonsensical, if you can get fine money from foreigny and spend it within these cheap countries then I'd call that a pretty nice life, especially with all the nice quality produce not tampered by* free europe-wide food market
lmfao that's genius
Yea HAES isn't a thing here and when I was bmi 27-28 my family was quite direct with it
Also at office (smaller office, friendly environment) we make frequent jabs at co-workers that gain weight
It's portion control, my diet past two months was pizza, burger and fries and I still lost weight because I was under 2k calories
Edit: homemade burgers and I keep an eye on other nutrients
Replied to other people that I make my own burgers, have considerably healthy breakfast and keep an eye on nutrients
Explain please
Got me ... What we do for karma ...
My calorie counter app has all nutrients listed in it as well so I'm fine, thanks for your concern
All right, now be a brave person and do the same joke with a mosque in  **Riyadh

It's the only thing you are sure to get in every food stand here in Slovakia (alongside párek v rožku) and it's hungarian
Blasphemy
I used to work with some Hungarians and after 3-4 drinks we always had history discussion, I loved it since we agreed that history should remain in the past

Yep, it's Hungarian
Same with Gulas or Lecso with paprika
I guess I could guess it by the name
I too, played ***Assassin's Creed Revelations***.
Yeah, and the knight ends up taking about 1 gold coin from a giant mountain of said gold coins
That's not what I'd call success
Make the fines real
what illegal thing they did
They still provide good service
I mean that is problem of the laws and anybody would do that
Because why wouldn't they do it if they can
I would do the same, rather then pay my scumbag  corrupt government that just splits it between few friends
There are
No but each of them has multi alternatives
NO they didn't stop lying
Here maps Bing maps, Kindle and the other one
There are alternative appstores
Google Earth is one yea
But that doesn't mean much
Mind the comma, UK !
If you truly want to piss us off, make Slovakia part of Hungary
Also DeutCHe Bank Holdings is amazing
you would have done better if you turned slovakia into hungary too
Oh my god this is amazing
You really nailed it
Would be more insulting to me if you called my county Hungary
You should have made southern Slovakia a part of Hungary

Are you serious
You seriously think it would be real to hire people to watch every fucking video uploaded
There is x videos uploaded every second
Google could easily remove all the videos and they would still not break anything
It's private site, for free
Same as if reddit removed your comments
It's not your right to be able to upload videos
Google would probably gladly just allow everything, but they have to do it like this, or they will get constantly sued by media companies

I wish EU was allied with US and Russia the same, and maybe in the future with China aswell, when they overthrow the communist government and transfer to something less dictatorish
EU and NATO gives small and otherwise insignificant countries such us mine, security for the future, now we dont have to look behind our backs, and can focus on boosting our economy upwards
Long live the EU, and hopefuly Biden wont dissapoint with NATO and demand bullshit he does not understand, like Trump did

Historically was there some strong Portugal influence in Russia or vice versa
Or what is going on
Well cars are one thing, but I sincerely admire those trees you have over there, I just wish that Bratislava and other Slovak towns and cities had some as well
I mean they are planting new trees but it’s a long time process and as a result the cities are incredibly hot during summer since there is literally no shadow whatsoever
Anyway, good for Amsterdam, It’s a lovely city

Does this mean we can finally stop hearing about Brexit every week

This is why I absolutely adore RTVS in Slovakia
It's become significantly more independent from the local government over the past few years, has very balanced and fair news
The current government actually perceives them as an opposition, but they can't do much about it because for the first time in forever, RTVS is popular
They do good work
I see no problem, everything is true
Oh reminds me of Slovakia in the '90, Mečiar as a strong national leader, who was could fill a stadium of cheering people during campaigns, state television run as a government propaganda channel, oppositions or everybody with any objections were national traitors and sell outs to the west, international critique and concerns were presented as an attack on our statehood and after we were left out from the talks to join the EU and NATO, he said we will focus to the east (russia)
We went through that shit with Vladimir Meciar in 90ies
I hope we won't repeat the same mistake
Because then would poland go bancrupt

Could it be geezers in the pub were wrong about this
I don't know what to believe anymore
9 lmfao
So I left SOONER than most kids
Wow
Slovacchia wtf
Exactly, and this is called out every time we have this discussion
I left home at 24 after finishing university; most people do
But my permanent residence was still there, because I was only renting a place
Didn't start owning one until few years later, and even then many people just don't care or forget and leave the permanent address at their parents' anyway for years
Absolutely this
When it comes to Slovakia, that map indicates when Slovaks buy property on their own
The Permanent Residency status laws are extremely outdated, and the process of changing your permanent residency is rather involved
It is difficult to get a permanent residency in an apartment, or in your dorm when in high school / college
I moved abroad at the age of 18 and have not lived in Slovakia for 12 years now, own property in the US where I live with my husband
But I am still living at my parents' address as far as the Slovak government is concerned
I don't know how to change it, and I don't care to
My sister moved abroad as an 18 year old as well, she lives in Bratislava with her fiancé now(8 hour train ride from home), but has no way of registering herself at the rented apartment, and she won't change her address until her and her fiancé buy a house next year
So, the data will show her leaving home at the age of 28, even though she will not have lived with my parents for over 10 years by then
I'm 32 and married to a foreigner with residence permit
We both still have our residence addresses at my mother's house, even though we live in a completely different town than her for 5+ years now
The first place we rented didn't allow us to put our addresses there and after we got our own place, we decided to just wait a year more because we would need to change everything to the new address and that takes the major piss
We'll wait until husband has to renew his residency and then get the new one to the new address
Edit : also, the town my mother lives in will implement the 'parking fee per each registered car per address' thing soon
So she would have to pay for two cars' parking even though I'm not even there (we both own cars)
Which is another stupid thing they want to implement
Should just give people residential parking permits so they can buy ad many as they need and not this stupid idea
So, you're saying I need to get an investment property outside of Stockholm that will make it easier to move to Sweden if the dumdum wins the election in November
Huh
I’m Slovak, so no issues there
I’m also joking around, although the conversation about moving to Europe is becoming more real and will definitely become more serious if Donald wins again
Part 2
Just this week it come out that Head of the Slovak National Council, copied his final Final thesis back in 2000
And all he said is that he didn't do anything wrong
Also "anonym" reported to the police that the protest organizators are trying to make a coup
I am proud to be a Slovak
The ones in power see they couldn't stop up, now they try to scare us
It's ironic that they don't see that this is the same as the Velvet Revolution and guess what, they are the baddies
I wonder if they actually can comprehend that
This is kind of stupid since the system against fake degrees was established couple of years ago, so it is not possible to copy academic works of other people and claim as own
This is non-issue
It is more just protest against government :P We have surprisingly warm autumn so maybe people just like to spend evening out with friends and their friends and friends of their friends
Danko made his final project to get academic title in 2000
Few weeks ago media started talking about it
He made it private so nobody could read it
In 1999 there was the same project with the same title and same number of pages, but somehow it'is missing, and in 2001 there was another one and is also made private
After media pressure he finally made it available to public
Result is that he just copied text from 5 books at least, with no sources, presented it as his work
IIRC from 70 pages, 50 were just copied, direct translation from Czech
This person is always center of attention, he is basically meme, because he gets his words mixed up and his sentences don't make much sense
He's always trying to make stupid rules in parliament, to make it harder for opposition, he loves Russia  and usually talks against official Slovak position
And he acts like he is better then everybody, always talks about how everybody should just be calm and quiet
about 1%
We did manage to get PM the fuck out and nearly gave him a stroke
Now, we just need to finish the second part

so sad
As a Slovak who prefers the sea over mountains, I am not complaining
I don't think I could handle living in a flat, mountainless country like Latvia
This is not acceptable, I demand a redo
We got sea
But it's cold :(
Finally a map where you can do linguistic things without Hungary sticking out like a sore thumb

Is it usual for Netherlands police to not wear uniform or to ride bikes
This video seems too unbelievable to be true
Thats more Czech than German
I think this is the case
The socks in sandals is a trope that our Czech brothers embraced in self-deprecating style of humor
It was also a mark of eastern geek culture
The traditional geek in let's say 1990s in eastern bloc was not somebody with Star Wars or Star Trek t-shirt or some such
He was a guy who wore his father's or grandfather's silon trousers and an old shirt while he was tinkering with his radio or while he wrote some piece of code on paper that he can later test on some old computer at school
And with the rise of status of geeks - when they got good paying jobs as software engineers and so on - this type of fashion somehow also got elevated in status
It is actually a very interesting phenomenon
Making fun of Czechs because of the classic 'Socks&Sandals' duo
You disgust me
What will follow, making fun of Scots and their kilts
^^^^^yes
Who cares, the sentiment matters more, maybe talk about that instead
Or the lack of a mask, anything with substance
Fuck leave them alone, they could contain damned souls and 2020 is not over yer
probably that friday night bag of SLOVAKIA chips, which are in reality made in Czech Fucking Republic
might be the biggest scam in history, maybe ever
got no clue honestly, probably logistics or already existing infrastructure making it economically more feasible, also they're exporting into a euro-based country so the Czech crown costs could be theoretically lower
also they're producing crisps, can't imagine they're making tens of millions out of them
idk really
did they rise up against Hungary opression of Slovakia for centuries

This is by far not mostly celebrated in poland
Kupačka
Same in Slovakia
Remember, if you don't throw water on her and she withers, grows sick and dies, that's on you !
actually it does, aside from that water thing the blooming willow is supposed to give the girls power and health
Probably because Poland is the biggest country celebrating it
However the celebration itself is celebrated in many other , mostly Slavic countries

I dont understand who are those people, who are in favour of communism as being a real alternative
Those people are terribly disillusional
I understand those back in the day - as it was "the new shit", and it was at the beginning of industrial revolution
But times has changed, now we know what it looks like and also we are far behind industrial revolution and this just makes no sense in todays society even from philosophical point of view
I also find a bit strange that this comes from "intellectuals". Like what do they think it is going to look like
People working in fields to have food and those "intellectuals" are going to write poems
If you dont have any high demand technical skill, you are the one going to crop vegetables in the fields, so you can start right away, even with no communism
EDIT: For all the fellow communism fans, i feel like i have to mention this: "Me personally, i a fan of capitalism with strong social safety net, for example like scandinavian countries". Also i do believe that as time will progress there will be more and more orientation toward bigger social safety net, and at some point in the future some form of universal basic income will be established, when food production, housing etc
(basic human needs) will be fully automated and very cheap to produce
So less stress on people on the lower income side
Also i fully support public education, national universal healthcare system etc
and i do believe accessible healthcare is a human right
So i am pretty pro-masses i guess, i fully support helping the ones who struggle
Having said that, i dont understand how is this all communism related
Why there is any calling for complete revolution and total change of the only system we know works on a national scale
If there are ANY examples or functioning communism or anything close to it ANYWHERE in the world, feel free to educate me
I am interested in reality and real examples, not some sci-fi philosophical "if-then" scenario
I feel like many people who support communism dont really know how society/country works
There are always going to be people in power
That has nothing to do with socialism, communism, capitalism, fascism, and other similar -isms
People will always construct some social structure, that is the only way we can exist, this is a biological argument
So if your pro-communism support comes from idea of completely abandoning social structures and "equality" that is unbelievably naive
I would love to teleport into the future and see "Crimes committed by capitalism". Oil wars, extreme poverty, people dying from preventable diseases because they can't afford healthcare, sweatshops, inhuman labor conditions and so on
I would love to see that from an outside perspective too
> Oil wars, extreme poverty, people dying from preventable diseases because they can't afford healthcare, sweatshops, inhuman labor conditions and so on
You know you can literally say the same about communism
It is the similar shit I read about environmentalist lefties who praise communism
I would invite them in one of several thousand sites in Slovakia where communist apparatchiks dumped toxic waste in undocumented landfills just to fill quota so they can get promotion for fulfilling the 5-year plan with 120% result
Well
Not really
The unfetter capitalism can work to some degree, even though i would not want to live in such place
I agree, but where did I do this
If communism has to be totalitarian (which i believe is the case at current state of human evolution), then that implies that it will become totalitarian and the government will act this way
I dont want to sound mean or anything, but you seem like an american, meaning - falling for great chants, not to care any deeper
>Yes
Terribly disillusioned with capitalism
Why
I am personally no fan of hardcore capitalism, i am in favour of social democracy per-se, as i can see some flaws with "captialism with no rules", and i strongly oppose consumerism
But social democracy is not communism, that is something COMPLETELY different
>It was never "the new shit", as communist ideas (on national scale) date back to French Revolution (Conspiracy of Equals)
It was the new shit, because it was in the rise of industrial revolution
At the time all the people working were "creating values", the main idea for communism as a nationwide system (which even contradicts itself to great degree) was that, people who work in manufacturing will be owners of the mean of production
But now with fully automated industries it makes zero sense
So those countries with modern communism would end up like venezuela, where 10000 people work in a company that needs only 100 workers
therefore the costs are ridiculous, and the company is not able to compete in worldwide economy
Basically they would produce products to expensive and too uninnovative to be a reasonable buy
Because all the money other companies would put in innovation, they would put in wages for redundant staff
Also the idea that communism means equal is ridiculous
>People still work for wage
Nothing had changed
and what do you them to work for
I dont understand the whole concept
In modern society, a lot of jobs are being and will be automated
There can literally be ONE guy having a multimillion dollar IT company
He doesnt need any other workers to achieve such goal
Why would he split his resources with any other people
Outside of taxation of course
>The same way as it did in USSR is usually "good enough, for a start".
Do you understand that those were sent into fields
I am from a country formerly lead by communists, "intellectuals" were literally the "enemy of the state". They were being called "parasites" and sent to prisons
The whole idea was that workers own the mean of production and rule the society
So if you are not a worker, you will become a worker
That is not just former soviet interpretation of communism, it is The communism
Intellectuals are still being portrayed over here (in eastern europe) as "lazy coffee drinkers". To this very moment, that is the legacy of former soviet era
>The  bit that you do not get is that those intellectuals do not rely on  Right-wing propaganda to form their understanding of USSR or communism
No, because they rely on fairytales they like to make up, completely ignoring reality
Both as the reality of society itself (like people are not going to willingly share their means of production with the ones working less) and also the ACTUAL history of this movement
This is a typical american Black/White attitude - either hardcore capitalism, or communism - nothing in between
BTW do you understand that communism has nothing to do with socialism per-se
In all capitalist countries
Like India, or any third world country with shitty labor laws
Of course capitalism has done a lot of good for *us,* but it would be naive to not see how that affected everyone else
Are you seriously arguing about American atrocities as a counter agument to communism with someone from Serbia
Wow
Just Wow
You must be joking  Please go to estonia teach them how they want USSR back
Wait a moment, so now we use revolutions that lead to end of totalitarian regime as an example for revolution that would lead to a totalitarian regime
The whole point was to make a revolution so people can have freedom of choice and are no longer in totalitarian regime
It is not the same if you use it the other way
I am honestly astonished by some opinions over here
By my "unfetter capitalism can work" i meant it can exist, not that it is right
Unlike communism that can NOT exist unless human beings literally get trough biological evolution
It never will no matter if it is a good idea or a bad one
That has nothing to do with socialism
Me personally i am a fan of big social safety net etc
and i agree with you how ridiculous is US healthcare system etc
but that has NOTHING to do with communism
And saying "capitalism can exist" doesnt mean i am a proponent of such idea
So for again for people who have hard time to read - I DON WANT UNFETTERED CAPITALISM
All i said was - it is realistic, possible
How
Back then, feudalism was pretty much a hardcore capitalism
And it worked to some degree
Show me ONE example of communism to work in functional society in the history
Dont get me wrong, i am not advocate for unfettered capitalism by any stretch of imagination, but what i am saying is: "unfettered capitalism is stupid/wrong, yet still realistic unlike communism, which is not realistic in society based on human beings
Some americans have
You were talking about COMMUNISM, not socialism
Please DO NOT mix those two together
My "american" commentary was unrelated to actually political arguments, i was referring to the "Black or White" way of thinking, where everything is either perfectly good or perfectly wrong
And you just have to pick a side and fight for it
(just to feed my curiosity - are you by any chance british or french, or living in UK or france
Well it depends
Yes, in russia yes
But here in slovakia we had democratic country and communists got into power by coup dtat, and made it totalitarian
It doesnt take majority of the people to make an revolution, that is a wrong assumption
So it can be reversed
It democratic country, revolution is always totalitarian, because otherwise the changes would come from democracy
Well, that looks worse than here
We gotta pump those numbers up
\>70

Actually, Hungary propably has more than Czechia, since a lot of Slovakian pornstars are classified as Czech

There was an old regime joke about this, something about never inviting a soviet over because last time we did they only stayed for 20 years
My grandpa told me a story of his from the invasion, he was living in Nové Zámky (south Slovakia) when the invasion happened
He was protesting in the town square when Hungarian tanks rolled in, blocking their way tankman style when one of them opened their hatch, aimed his SMG at him screaming "Im gonna mow you down like a dog"
Its really a shame what happened to the east
Czechoslovakia had powerful economy before WW2, everything got taken apart, communism ruined the rest
And even during communism Czechoslovakia could have achieved much with their "Socialism with human face" if not for the Warsaw pact and USSR ofc
Where would we be now if those fuckers didn't do this

There were demonstrations in the whole country
Sometimes they were individual actions of bravery
For instance at three PM on august 21st 1968 in the town of Zvolen one Jozef Levák lied down in the path of the convoy of tanks
The commander of the column issued an order for the convoy to proceed running over him
There were spontaneous gatherings in other cities
In Bratislava students confronted soviet soldiers who then shoot into the crowd killing three people
In the city of Košice over 400 people built barricades in the city to prevent tanks moving through
The demonstrants threw stones on the armed column
The result was again shooting into the crowd with several shot dead and dozens heavily wounded
A few photos from the incident [here]

Large cities have different problems and levels of education than little town or villages
Take any political survey map (especially from a country with high level of corruption) and you'll run into same results
And as it was pointed out
It's not that these people are bad or extremely dumb
They are most likely simple people who barely scrape by and then they see lavish lifestyles of people in big cities and obviously they're jealous
Because often, these lifestyles are even paid for from their taxes (and if not, it's usually not an honest way anyway)
Naturally, that's what Erdogan, Putin, Orban, our very own belowed Fico (Slovak Republic) and others do too
But their whole program is based on speaking to those simple people, assuring them they are the ones fighting this plague (often very dramatically, sometimes even sacrificing a lot) and that they're the ones who will stop their misery and make things right for "normal people".
Of course, sooner or later, a huge chunk of these simple people will realize that they were manipulated (or played like A DAMNED FIDDLE
) and
enter extreme right-wing parties
These guys add on to old promise, saying they are *HONESTLY* normal, regular people and that they *WILL* truly and justly deal with *all* those who do bad shit to them
And there we go
All we need to do is make sure people running states are good, honest, uncorruptable people
Easy right
Wear masks or at least cover your face with a scarf
And gloves
You can keep others from getting infected if you already are
Be mindful people
No home office
I mean here cities and public transport is completely deserted for a week
Britain is best in creating problems that can be later solved with great sacrifice
Like Chamberlain and Churchill
And Brexit recently
Clearly Finland provoked it
Why are you so soviet-phobic
I'm just gonna assume "älskade" is Swedish for "mongol".
cough on him
Cries in Bratislava
The only capital in EU wo metro (if Im nit mistaken)
Yeah, slovakia is beautiful
Trying really hard to not include baltics in Nothern or Eastern Europe I see
OH yeah, we are definitely, 100% a central europe
So Slovakia is Middle East
And that is a bad thing
I am as anti-austria-hungary as person can be, but what problem does this create
I worded it wrong
There are a lot of comments in this thread that says that this is problem, or that it's agenda pushing
It was more of a question
Isn't it weird that we can just watch events happening thousands of kilometers away live
Notre Dame burns
There are at least two livestreams
Volcano eruption
Of course there is some webcam pointing at it, even though most of the time it probably shows almost still picture
Oh those random apartment block, no street line
You sure showed them
>Im not saying all muslims are bad but from what Ive seen and experianced, the number of violent extremists is much higher among immigrant population then for example domestic muslim population
then you've seen and experienced bs lmao
No its not
He said that you cant have a soldier at every corner and your solution is to give any random idiot a gun
Are you serious
> Gun owners, at least in the Czech republic, are often better trained than the police
The police is lucky if they go to a range twice a year, gun owners are usually at a range several times per year or even several times per month
If you say so, it must be true
> And even an idiot can pull a trigger and kill a terrorist
Or any other innocent bystander
And again
Those are not soldiers
V čem má být háček
Not even mad
Greetings from Slovakia
Have a big dick
GOod -10C this morning
That obviously isnt true, because they wouldnt vote for her, if they didnt want her
I need this in my life
PRetty nice
Migrants
You mean people on vacation
They already have them
There aren't many things I'm personally divided about and cant quite figure out if they really suck or are kind of cool
Monarchs are one of them
By this merit, many times were shitty times
I remeber colleagues in Antwerp telling me about bomb attacks in early 80s. Terrorism is one of the worse tactics
Better not talk about the terrorist, rather about victims, and show no fear
Stay strong Nederland
For Slovakia two words are enough: "Upper Hungary
Not the best way to piss us off
Best one is "I was in your country
Such a beutiful land
I really loved that strip of sea you have
Another way to go there would be to call Slovenia Slovakia and vice versa
It's been a while since I last saw that mistake but it's a classic
No, but you would definitelly score some points if you would say " Janosik is polish folk hero right
I live in Africa now and people often ask me where I'm from
to their credit, few knew we split peacefully and are now two countries but vast majority's reply is "Aaaah, Czechoslovakia".
*sigh*
Literally **24 years** ago
I was surprised how mad it was in Italy
Even young people had hard time at reception in b and b.
I'm saving the coordinates, whoever lives there during zombie apocalypse, I'm sorry but I'm taking over
For a bit of fun, the current Vice president of USA won't have a meal with another woman without his wife present as per the Billy Graham rule for pretty much the same reasons
Fundies gonna do fundie things
Just drain and we'll finally be able to invade Britain on land
"As I was saying
poď.
"nadalj" really look a bit like "naďalej" so
neither is mine, so I can't really fix you with Slovenian
Kind of a bad taste to merge Slovakia with Hungary
Especially since we are dealing with the pandemic better than many of the other countries right now so the image isn't even appropriate
As for whom I guess
Yes
Do they realse they can fly away to a different city
Nice
This
People were panic buying last week, now it is okay, except for my beans
SCHÖNER
Good luck, czech brothers and sisters
Oh man, I hate that shit
We got the same crap over here during protests after the journalist and his fiancee were killed
My mother, who was a child at the time, woke up on a seemingly normal morning, possibly due to commotion, looked out of window and there was a cannon/tank gun pointing right at their window, from a tank stopped on the main street
Way she tells it, it was so close, leaning over the sidewalk, they almost broke the glass pane with the thing
Can't imagine how terrifying that would be
Grandmother told me a story about a Russian tank crew that found it funny aiming the tank gun straight at people driving by and how the tank convoy was following her car for about 20 km aiming directly at her
And yet people here still get furious at you when you say something bad against Russia or Putin
Sir, how are you finding life in the US
As it’s the exact opposite of Czechoslovakia at the time, I would be interested in your perspective
We were threatening the Soviet Union with our democratic reforms of course
Would you be trying to run from someone who is aiming weapon right at you
I don't mean in your general direction, but straight in your face
Not after this
During that week the vast majority of people lost any kind of illusions about communism or socialism and and went into total political lethargy
None of the resistance movements in Czechia or Slovakia, both during ww2 and during CSSR, were politically aligned
They were simply resisting occupation
There were commies and socialists fighting alongside capitalists, as well as centralists fighting alongside autonomists
Yea, sorry
Anyway, it’s one of the most market-driven economies in the world, so my questions are: how are you finding its social side
(That is Health insurance & other types of safety nets that are common in the EU) Do you prefer the US model
Also, the job market, are there any significant differences that you found strange
What do Americans place more importance on, compared to us
Also, probably what I’m most curious about, what were your feelings when emigrating and upon the arrival to the US
I know it’s a lot of questions, but I’ll be thankful for your answers
I'll take this too, as another American Slovak
> How are you finding its social side
(That is Health insurance & other types of safety nets that are common in the EU) Do you prefer the US model
It's an absolute disaster
I have a good job with good benefits, yet I still paid around $5,000 for an emergency room visit
The care is not that much better than Eastern Slovakia, you have to be your own best advocate, both in terms of the care you get, as well as what you are charged
We have tens of millions of people who are uninsured, even more people who are underinsured
There are very few other social safety nets
No federal paid parental leave, no free pre-school or day care, no free colleges, no federally mandated sick leave, or paid leave
It's a complete dystopia at times
Obviously, some states have it better than others, quite a few of these things are finally getting addressed
We also earn A LOT MORE than in Europe (I make around 4 times what I would in Bratislava, 8 times what I would in Michalovce)
> Also, the job market, are there any significant differences that you found strange
What do Americans place more importance on, compared to us
Europeans work to live, Americans live to work
But just like the social safety net, this is changing
The millennials and Gen Xers are not beholden to the corporate world the way Americans used to be, and that's rather nice
There are no contracts in quite a few states - my employer can fire me today for almost no reason
I can leave today, I am not tied to the job at all
It has its advantages, I actually kind of like it
> Also, probably what I’m most curious about, what were your feelings when emigrating and upon the arrival to the US
I expected the adjustment to be much easier than it was
But again, so many things have changed over the last 10 years that I feel much more at home
You could not get a cider, everyone drank crappy beer, there was very little European chocolate, everything was very 1980s even in late 2000s. This has changes, majorly
People are into craft beer, you buy nice quality ice cream instead those 2 gallon tubs of sugary crap
The little things are changing and it's nice
I am here because I got a full ride scholarship to a great school, then fell in love with an American, and stayed here
As a gay man, the life here is fantastic (in a big, liberal city)
And most things that I had the biggest issues with are changing - Colorado just passed 12 weeks of paid parental leave, public pre-schools are expanding, the state is working on a public option for insurance
I have a lot of hope for the US :)
Also, 100% agree with BearStorms
If you make a good living, life here is FABULOUS
Tech gets released early, travel can be cheap, houses are huge, you can get fantastic food, all the concerts, etc
But lower income earners have a much better life in the EU
Resistance of the 1968 occupation wasn't unified, and Prague Spring wasn't uprising
It was series of reforms, which makes it even worse that it was treated this way
Wow, this has been really interesting to read and I’ve definitely learned a lot
Thank you for your perspective and the time it has taken to answer these questions
I wish you all the best
Wow, the no contract part actually scared me quite a bit
But I’m glad that things are changing for the better, and that the quality of the goods and services is getting improved
I actually have the same feeling about Slovakia, so overall great that both countries are improving at this
I would also like to thank you for sharing your perspective, and wish you best of luck
Or something like China and other east asian communist countries like Vietnam
I’m a healthcare marketing manager and my husband is a software engineer
If I knew how to do what corporations do with their money I would do it too
But we can't all live in Monaco like athletes do
And all you get in return is a nice, safe and confident country where everyone gets to pursuit their happiness to the best of their ability
In fact, their system works so well people from other countries migrate there to realise their dreams
Really shameful
Your dreams are different from mine, but then who am I to judge
Well, you know what they say - society grows when old men plant trees whose shade they know they will never enjoy
Luckily for you, there were such old men in The Netherlands a generation or two ago
What kind of old man or woman you'll be, that is up to you
Is this actually true though
Looks like Edward Scissorhands' place
Ah shit, here we go again
I only glanved through the list but I would say any country could achieve 9/10 of those points by themselves
Im so sad these things are happening in EU, we are the pinnacle of humankind yet people come here and cant integrate, because they got their brains wiped clean by somebody who is pulling strings and is too much of a lil´ bitch to actually participate
These "religion leaders" should be find, round up and united with their god
2 are dead, 7 are heavily injured, stop reading garbage
Czechia, Hungary and Poland included but Slovakia isn't? ok
And Slovakia ??
TIL: Slovakia is not part of europe
I looked at the top and bottom first (CZ and PL) and I was curious about Slovakia graph but it seems like it’s not part of Europe anymore
And nothing of value is lost
Also rip the entirety of Luxembourg
The british company demanded a full 50 million pound more then the french one
Their cunt CEO probably thought it was his chance to cash in on that sweet sweet money from the tax dunces, because where else would they get the new all british passport
In France
Then he had the gall to go whine on BBC about it :" I’m going to have to go and face [the print] workers, look them in the whites of the eyes and try and explain to them why the British government thinks it’s a sensible decision to buy French passports not British passports
Yall renovate those buildings
You do realize its the US ambassador, not the one from Saudi Arabia
Let me jump on this bandwagon of EU word maps with the most important word of them all
Comparing curse words is really hard
Every word on this map translates to something different
Kurva means whore, scheisse means shit, etc
I also feel that Kurwa is more used in Poland as opposed to Slovakia
I am from Bratislava and almost every single person I know from Bratislava mostly uses "Piča/Piči/Piče" as a one-word cussword, but it may also depend on which part of the country you are living in
&#x200B;
\- "Piča" is a vulgar word for woman's vagina
Wait bazmeg is a curse word in hungary
We use it to describe a weird thing or a machine
how is it in basque
or do you use the spanish one
KURV4
Russia has majority of people living in Europe, and has capital in Europe
+ they are the biggest ethnicity in Europe (slavs)
They are as european as one can get
I thought it’s a dick
Come to think of it, it is often used when angry so instead of like "I can't get this stupid thing to work"  you would say "I can't get this bazmeg to work"
thanks, that's interesting, i really like basque language lol
And, unsurprisingly, its used same way in Slovakia
We use it like "thing we don't want to waste time remembering how it's called
" When my classmate told me that it's vulgarism I thought she was joking, as there was often mild prank war stemming from language details
I stopped using it after that
122 mil
Russians and only 89 mil
Germans
Russians are slavs, and slavs are European
Isn't it amazing, fellow Europeans, than we can say "Serbian Nigger" is funny translation and no one is being offended or losing their mind
Oh I need a break like this from time to time from other subreddits whre 90 % of stuff is some weird American non-sense that isn't a problem in my country whatsoever
yeah, for example I live in "Brother and Glory"!
It's sooo freaking weird
I didn't believe that was even official for the first year or so
Orange like tin tin

50 cents for a small bottle price limit - awesome because even in an airport you don't get gouged

We want a spot too
Please add us too
I'm so proud of Czechia
They are in cultured society now
I want in there too

Perhaps you could have stated that in the title of the post – that's quite important detail
still better than our cult member
Czechia and Slovakia is no surprise to me (I am Slovak)
There is a lot of fake news and russian propaganda in our countries
It is not alternative media it is mainstream now (saw the statistics, the most viewed, liked and shared news are the ones from the alt media)
Our government does not know how to tackle it, and even kinda supports this view of the world
The Czech president and Slovak prime minister are against receiving any immigrants and are very anti muslim
We have very little muslim population and most people never saw a black guy
Love my "Czechoslovak" nation
Yup, all red, sounds about right
I have co worker who spends awful amount of time talking about how he would, and I will try to quote "Dig a hole in ground, make it white with lime, and fill it up with ...." Depending on discussion, there are all sorts of people who end up in holes
Excellent little joke he loves to tell during lunch in dining room
Everyone laugh a bit and shrug it off
Sadly, he kind of means it and I can't say I have ever witnessed anyone get indignant over that
How do you even deal with such kind of people
I have to spend whole day with him in one room and I would like to know of a way how to politely tell him to shut the fuck up about it
I'm very good at ignoring other people, but it kind of bothers me that no one ever tells anything to him about it
Wew
I've not really experienced anything negative towards different races
I think it comes down to the fact, that seeing black person for example is really rare
I actually can't remember the last time I've seen non-white person with my own eyes
I remember when I was 10 I was in London for a week and I saw a black guy
It was like seeing an alien to me
I'm pretty sure Czechs and Slovaks thought of Romani/Gypsies when they
were asked about blacks
Most people hate them over here and I haven't met a single person that's racist towards actual black people
"Would you feel comfortable if your child was in a relationship with
"No
Good
Fucking Hungary is more tolerant than us
What the fuck
As a Slovak, this doesn't surprise me at all
Fun fact: We also have literal nazis sitting in our parliament
Would you be comfortable to lower your chance be a donor of e.g. bone marrow if necessary to your grand/child
I don't believe this
They had to ask 50+ yo people
I know my country is infamous for being intolerant, but I have yet to meet someone who has the slightest problem with Asians or Jews
On the other hand I'm familiar with the attitude towards muslims and especially gypsies here
We are so so so sorry
Its not us we swear, its the rest of us thats the problem
Asian, not just vietnamese exclusively, I am sure there aren't such sentiments towards vietnamese if that was the question
Czech-oh-and-Slovakia
perhaps most of those were ignorant racists, but I know many people who do not feel racist but would not want their children to marry people of other culture/religion/race for the sake of at least some kind of preservation (continental/ethnolinguistic/national/subnational)
oh definitely :)))
Why we can't have such nice roads where I live
[ahahaha]
How so
If covid19 has taught us something, its that those stereotypes are true
Polish working from home :D
Fuck them, fucking idiots
Can we have a names
I should have not watched that
Now it's even worse knowing that they even don't doubt about it
Yea sadly there is 0 talk about this here
Not even news sites
Those clowns at CDU absolutely, without hint of a doubt deserve this
i hope the green party will reinstate the nuclear plants that germany closed down for no good reason
Mamy reasons but past few months showed how much its small circle of leadership in ivory tower detests its own voters and party members by installing Laschet to top, despite his opponents in both party and Union races being much more popular
Man, I hope they slip to single digits
Like what are you supposed to do with people like them
Its unreformable
That's sad
So slovakia is as bad as south dakota and everything else is just worse
>8 but not colored white
Error in number or coloring
It is the antislovak propaganda
I can never get over that little chunk of Russia just hanging out there surrounded by Poland and Lithuania

That seems pretty democratic - countries that have Euro like it, countries that do not have Euro, do not like it
Where are all those EU dictators
I love it an would not go back
My theory is it's about national pride and stability
When Slovakia decided to adopt euro the slovak currency (Slovenska Koruna) was very young and had pretty bad reputation
The exchange rate was getting worse every year and at worst it was ~50 SK for 1 eur
I remember people buying dolars and euros in case the situation gets even worse
So, many people said to themselves "So you want to replace our weak currency with something stable and widely accepted
Sign us in
". Long story short, there is little to no nostalgia for Slovenska Koruna and people enjoy benefits of stable single currency
Compared to that, Czechs had different story
Koruna Ceska was (and is) pretty stable currency and is viewed by many Czechs as part of national pride
Czechs are proud of their currency and their central bank is a very respected institution
It's not only about common people, but the shitstorm of Eurocrisis in 2011 convinced many elites (academicians, politicians also people from business) that Euro is a no-go in forseeable future
They are also not afraid to actively use monetary policy
In 2013-2017 crown was not allowed to go beyond 27 CZK/ EUR
This was mainly to prevent deflation
Some politicians criticized this decision, but it was a successful operation
Something similar that Swiss bank did with franc
In short, Czechs trust Czech central bank more than ECB
In Slovakia, Slovak crown was also managed good, but there was less national pride in it
In usual discussions about comparing Slovak and Czech economy and how Slovakia is catching up with Czechia it always included currency comparison
For Slovaks this was always a bittersweet remainder
Czech and Slovak crowns in 1993 started 1:1, but soon Sk was devalued to 1,1 SKK to CZK
Since around 1998 it was devalued to 1,3 and this difference was never equaled since then (it oscillated around 1,2-1,3)
However wages were numerically similar (or sometimes even higher in Czechia), which meant Czechs were richer
Prices were often numerically lower in Czechia which meant they could buy more
From psychological point of view, it was not difficult for Slovaks to say goodbye to crown
I don't like your placement of Austria and Slovenia, it makes it look like Slovenia borders with Slovakia and that Austria has no border with Hungary and Slovakia
You should have made Austria a bit more squishy and wide, so it's closer to Slovakia and Hungary with which is has borders
and put Slovenia below it
Otherwise this must have been fun
Why's my boy Slovakia shaking
Amazing
I find your lack of Prague disturbing
But hey, thanks for remembering that Bratislava exists - that's more than can be said for a lot of people that make augmented maps
Eh, it's fine
Don't worry about it
Would be cool if the city names had alternative/historical names (I'm from Bratislava so maybe *Pressburg* or *Prešporok* would looks good)
Also yea, why is Czech republic full of hugest mountains
Right
Who forgets Prague but adds Bratislava
What sort of fairy land it this
*slow clap*
Russian state TV also made and aired a "documentary" about how the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia prevented an incipient NATO fascist coup, complete with machine gun nests on the roofs&shit
You literally don’t give a shit about Christmas
Those BMW drivers are getting more creative every day
Meanwhile in Bratislava, Slovakia
no way
BMW drivers not using their blinkers
Yes, thats pretty suspicious behaviour, what was she planning
It's called House Attack and it was created by some Austrian artist
Strabag is Austrian construction company and they thought this would look cool on their Slovak headquarter
More info, try Google translate though I'm not sure how helpful it'll be with Slovak language
They do
A huge number of abortions performed in Slovakia is actually done for Polish women
Consequently, Slovak women travel to Austria as Austria allows medical abortion (not just surgical) which Slovakia does not
Has to be pretty nice moment
Do cars also stop

The only reason my country is so low is because people are willing to go into debt
Im pretty sure this was when he was informed of the German invasion, not the fall of Kiev
Whats up with Estonia
And also how does it work for countries like taiwan, northern cyprus, kosovo, transinistria, crimea etc
I suspect their options are pretty limited
Why do the V4 countries have less countries available than the rest of the EU
Hello Passport seller I am going on vacation and I want your strongest passports
I got my haircut yesterday
Well it looks like finland and ireland have the strongest pasports in the world
Yes, because transnistria, crimea etc
are
right
That was pretty much my point
Fair enough, dont you know by any chance the situation in transnistria

Soon the same cover with the VW company
I hope not
I never used an apple phone and I do not intend to, but they are the only competitor to android
Without apple, google would go all the way to screw the consumer
I am more concerned about the software rather than the hardware
Hardware has competion within non-apple products, operating systems are Android or Apple exclusively
didnt work out for the glorious microsoft windows mobile
Here in Europe iPhones are used mostly by hipsters and businessmen (a smaller percentage)
PCs also make up ~90% compared to Macs, which are mostly used by hipsters, artists and designers
Students, gamers and companies almost always use PCs
I was actually really surprised that it's the other way around in the US
*EDIT: [except the GB apparently]
Sure, but whoever would see this through could make the best OS in the world, the real challenge is to convince the customers to buy in
Its already hard to to make a jump from android or applie because all of your purchases / licenses / etc
It's not, but UK is kind of an exception in this regard
As most of the time anyway
[Here's] a table for 2015 and 2016
And when it comes to central and eastern europe
an iPhone costs as much as an average Joe earns in a month
Would you pay your monthly earnings for a phone
Most people wouldn't.
There are many premium apple stores, that's true
There aren't that many customers in them though
While that might be the case, it's still worth it for the seller
I've noticed that some general electronics stores have one guy dedicated to watch for potential apple customers
He/she hangs out by the apple products and talks to everyone who touches an iPad
Had one try and convince me to buy an iPad instead of a much cheaper Samsung tablet
I mean, I would if I could afford it
Yea it kind of looked nice in that dirty form too
we need to talk more about the hunk of a ~~doctor

Winter time is great for dumpster diving
Tons of free "refrigerated" food

They rather throw it away than give people a discount

What do you mean "republic of china"? Mainland China is not republic, rather postcommunist dictatorship
I can't tell how large this statue is

Great nation, greets from Slovakia

Why isn't this day a holiday in Slovakia
In his memoirs written by Karel Čapek he specifically says his father was slovak and spoke slovak, although he wasn't prominent figure in his life
Some of us would love to, there are proposals to make it, officially, a M. R. Štefánik remembrance day
Sadly, it's not happening in the near future
Thanks, as a Slovak, I appreciate that
Look at our Parliament
Austro-Hungarian Empire was fine (I guess) for Austrians and Hungarians, others were second-rate nations with no influence (in best case) or directly oppressed (in worse case)
Do you realize that Czechoslovak independence from Austria - Hungary was direct consequence of World War
Be careful what you wish for
You'll come back crawling *yet*!
But when they come back and we let them in, it's going to be Slovakioczechia
(laughs awkwardly)
No, I don't think most Slovaks see our common state as oppressive or illegitimate
It just wasn't "our" state and we place the Year One in 1993
It's clear that Czechs were dominant partners in this relationship and this was recognized abroad as well where we all were called just Czechs instead of cumbersome Czechoslovaks
That could've taken a toll on our identity, which was admittedly pretty fragile
For instance in the last census, 6,000 people in Czechia identified as having Czechoslovak ethnicity
The last census where we've had this option was in 1993 and 0 people claimed it
I guess that speaks for itself
Well, in our case we always threw the blame on magyars
Always seen austrians as those wise, rich, ontellectuals over there and hungarians as nationalists who stamped all over us
Austrians get second-hand blame of letting it come so far
But it should be a national holiday imo
Those christian holidays should be scrapped imo
Having a national holiday abouy "seven-pain Maria"? You think anyone even knows what that is about
We dont need any more, we just need more historical ones so kids can have their heroes and not christian ones
But we are the more christian state in Czechoslovakia
The name in English is Our Lady of Sorrows, and yes, you're right
It's a purely Catholic holiday celebrating the patron saint of Slovakia
Its holiday that no one, no one knows what the deal is
Its not special to anyone
Actually, Masaryk's father was Slovak, his mother was Czech

Probably small village schools draging  it down

Branik was my starter beer
We really had no big experience with beer at the time, so it all tasted bitter to us
I started my university in Prague drinking that with my buddy, and basically coming to terms with the whole beer taste
We used to call it the beggar's beer considering the price, and IMO it tasted beery enough to us at the time
Nevermind the occasional bad batch, it was still cheaper than some bottled water
Nowadays I am a completely loyal beer person, and I always look back to Branik thinking
wow, I don't want to know what it actually tastes like now that I'm used to finer beers
But still, the beer is my nostalgia
And probably still better than American beer
TIL there were 3 Cod Wars with Iceland
Well their position as key NATO naval base in northern Atlantic might have played a role
These posts always seem slimy to me
As if they're not actually celebrating Poland's independence but instead using an independence day to promote an EU agenda
I so much don't miss UK summers
I remember that temps over 33 were unusual
20° during the night was like special occurring mentioned in news
Downside is increased energy consumption, thus increased carbon footprint, heating the planet that much more
That's a very simplified way of looking at it imho
There are peaks and troughs in energy consumption and currently there's only one way of dealing with them, and that's to have a certain percentage of fast reacting power plants which can regulate their output quickly
Increasing power usage leads also to increased need of these power plants
Furthermore, AC units use quite a lot of electricity and are responsible for many of those peaks
Your power was generated in wind power plants just on paper
You need to consider the whole grid
Unless of course you were totally disconnected from the grid - but that's not true for absolute majority of people
Looks like a good thing
If you can't implement the "this is the list of things we do with your data, do you agree
" pop-out, just wtf is on that list
I love when Dutch start showing off how they are paying so much to the EU
Stingy as dutch
You make 10% of your GDP just by enabling smooth logistics for materials to us and for products from us
So STFU and keep your roads clean :p
If I wanna know about meatballs, I'll ask you
About pasta, I ask Italy
THIS
Ask any chef
You leave a bit of starchy water in (5cl), then add your sauce and mix it until reduced
Served mixed, sprinkled with Parmesan
This way you make the sauce to penetrate top layer of the pasta
Delizioso
That's what they were labeling him anyway, and it was meant as an insult
Instead of staying on the back foot, he ran with it
The situation is stupid, but I don't think his move was
I wonder how much porn flows through there
>New York, Singapore, and Hong Kong are also outside of the EU and they do fine as well
They are also outside UK and they do fine as well
And its not just everyone outside financial industry, its also everyone inside
Literally no company in City is talking about increasing their size or shares in City
Next to everyone is weighting between these three options - leave, remain as it is or downgrade
Most leaning to third option with few already opting for first and other thinking about it, pending the result of negotiations to make decision
Yeah, success, this is how it looks like
We don't need to punish them
We don't even have any measures to do so, they're a sovereign country
That's a stupid, stupid narrative created by brexiters so they have something to blame their stupidity on
We just don't need to pamper them
Showing them what the world outside is like isn't punishment, it's just the default state of things
Kinda like not inviting your neighbours to your house for dinner cause they're not family isn't punishment, it's just not granting them privileges that stem from being a family member

So you put Kosovo on the map, but Crim is still under Ukraine
Go there and ask the people there
The people have chosen

Where do i sign up my country for this tradition
I almost forgot it is the “šišky” time of the year already
šišky
We call that šišky
Šišky :) But we eat them with jam on top
Not even a banter
What non-american would ever purchase american cars
I mean, they are automatic
What am I 5 or what
I mean who wouldn't when you gov is corupt
Bet the guy is now thinking that he should've nicked the swordfish and beat him with that, instead of the extinguisher
Would get the better spotlight
I can see this as a background for one of those motivational posters for International Flavors & Fragrances
You can find tons of these "correlations" of random things that have nothing to do with eatch other
The explanation for this is most likely that cocoa is expensive and good quality chocolate is seen as luxurious product and countries with good economics can afford it
As well as put money in science
You mom didn't think I'm a tiny speck last night
Slovakia, Czechia and Austria have only Capitals blue
The best schools are at capitals but I dont think thats where all the students are living permanently
we all should stop putting the damned /s
either people get it or they don't, either they're thickskulled or capable of understanding basic sarcasm
I Looooove Florence
But Cristina Vespucci wasn't Vieri de'Pazzi's sister
Here in western Slovakia, the summer of 2019 was pretty bad, well, yesterday I saw 27 degrees when I checked the temperature
Today it was 24 degrees, looking at the forecast tomorrow its supposed to be 14 degrees, and it goes up from that point on, what the fuck is even going on at this point
Like 25 is already like mid-July level temperature, at this rate we are gonna melt in a few weeks
Shame I just found out when it’s almost over :(
We Slovaks have it better than Romanians, most Hungarians in Slovakia like the country and most Hungarian Hungarians barely know we exist
20€ for 600/300 here
Before fiber it was 20 for 7/1
That can't be right  that's like dial up
Isn't it Mbps
Does it reach above the sea level
I don't really understand the meaning of your comment
Perhaps you should've written "Spoiler: Germany was winning
At least for a while
**And then Soviets won** *(actual spoiler part of this sentence)*." This is how spoilers work I believe
Maybe I just misunderstood
Oh, damn, yeah you didn't :D
Probably not really today, judging by cars looks pretty old
This map is wrong
Slovakia with them visible borders
Definitely not enough in Slovakia
Plenty cities and towns are simply missing in Slovakia
Just looking at Eastern Slovakia, Kralovsky Chlmec (7000 inhabitants), Velke Kapusany (9000 inhabitants), Trhoviste (2000 inhabitants) are missing
I did some investigation, and Michalovce region should also have dots for following villages: Budkovce (1498 inhabitants), Drahňov (1507), Lastomír (1187), Malčice (1503), Markovce (1017), Moravany (1047), Nacina Ved (1815), Pavlovce nad Uhom (4628), Petrovce nad Laborcom (1063), Pozdišovce (1310), Rakovec nad Ondavou (1072), Vinné (1843), Vrbnica (1163), Zalužice (1171)
So, this map is WILDLY incorrect
3% Britons have not heard about Czechia but only 2% have not heard about Slovakia
We are famous !!
3% for Russia
They still think our county sucks tho :D
Don't be so sure man, Polish minorities are fucking everywhere and they understand at least 50%

i am not crying, you are
Aw fuck here we go again
There was a thunderstorm a few hours back, it was the last breath of normal weather, here it comes
I looked at this post and I've been shaking since
I'm genuinely terrified of hot weather
I would sell my kidney for an AC
The whole June it was just raining and raining
Portable AC is still expensive and for reasons I'm not going to go into rn I can't really have it
I do have a swamp cooler, but the humidity is too high, so it's awful
And if I make just myself wet, then that lasts maybe 5 minutes
Basically the biggest issue is that there's no solution
Autumn > Spring > Winter > > > > > > > > Summer
BUt we actually can't. We understand, but nobody speaks it
As we speak our own languages between each other, which is pretty weird when you think about it
IT should never be counted in these polls
For Slovakia I guess it's probably Czech, then English, Hungarian, German, Russian, Ukrainian and Romani
Czech is the closest language to our Slovak and we can write, speak and understand it without much problems, because we've been exposed to it since our childhood
English and German are taught at least to some extent at most of our schools as secondary languages used in communication with the foreigners, but we've come a long way since they were introduced to the general population
Most young adults have to take the final exam called 'maturitná skúška' or 'maturita' from English at the end of their secondary education and they can choose to take the final exam from B1 or B2 level
Hungarian, Russian, Ukrainian and Romani are the languages used primarily by the people belonging to one of the main minority groups (Hungarian is the most dominant out of these)
In Slovakia, English is mandatory and you get to choose a third language in bilingual schools: French or German
In Slovakia English is mandatory and then you choose between German and Russian
German is more popular
What do you mean by fluently though
Like its literally changing a letter here and there and then its like a handful of words
If by fluently you mean not making any mistakes then I cant speak any language fluently
I can speak Czech but it sounds like a Slovak speaking Czech but I can do it fluently only stopping to think for a second to find the word for a broom which I imagine wouldnt happen if I would speak Czech more and more
You could have just said that you consider proper grammar to be fluent
I cant write in Slovak and barely manage in English
Also I think poor grammar is both very Slovakian and Czechian and I also doubt those two are words
I do think more Slovaks speak czech than Czechs speak Slovak for example

I don't know what this guy's talking about, but shark finning is banned all over EU:
>Shark finning has been banned in European vessels and waters since 2003
EU regulation was tightened in 2013 to require “all EU vessels to land sharks with their fins still naturally attached to the carcass”, according to Ali Hood, director of conservation at the Plymouth-based Shark Trust
Maybe he really is talking about something else
Maybe he's just repeating what liars told him, who knows
Based Czechia (Bohemia/Moravia/Czech Silesia)
was the Russian administration oppressive when it came to Finland and Finns
I saw gorgeous architecture built there but that's the only thing I can witness, I don't think I can find an unbiased source given I don't speak perkele
ah yes Nikolai II fucking things up as always and leaving a bitter aftertaste lmao
ty for the link, it's good that the autonomy was respected for such a long time
So many airplanes and it is still burning
How big is that fire
Is it biggest in Sweden's history
The irony is that here it is raining for a week or so every day
this can't be accurate
Last year there was 41 degrees in August in Slovakia
Not from romania but screw corruption anyway
Beautiful
How do you pronounce Cochem in German
Like Zochem or like Kochem
Man these will be like 60° C when it's warm
There is oversight and review
They're not uncommon, but the part you don't see is that these public procurement are continuously audited and if discrepancies are found, a corresponding part of the contribution will have to be returned
Example:
If the problems are rampant, the money can even be withheld preventively :
WTF
Why would that be default
Seams stupid
So Santa is actually Hungarian and is greeting everyone with "Snow, snow, snow
" ?
That hurt
Praise the sun
In my considerable experience, France is way off
Fairly accurate, just replace the british flag with american
Yes, but you don't end up speaking it because it's pretentious and weird and not at all like all the american movies from which you actually pick up your accent
What is purchasing power based on
I mean sure food can be a little cheaper, but electronics, cars etc
will cost the same i whole Europe
Which means some people have to work multiple months for something and other just few weeks
People just save more
You save for the whole year to buy something
People can't just buy it, because it's not part of one month salary but more months
