Latvian "red's" were at the center of the Russian Civil War and took up various positions of power in the USSR afterwards
* Jukums Vācietis was the [first ever commander of the Red Army]
* Jēkabs Peterss actually [founded the VChK aka
"cheka" along with Felix Dzerzinsky] and served as deputy chairman there
* Pēteris Ķuzis was [the head of the GRU from 1920 to 1935
] He got there due to being "recognized by his superiors for his work in pursuing, arresting, and liquidating Russian sailors after the Bolshevik suppression of the Kronstadt rebellion in March 1921".
* Jānis Rudzutaks was a [member of the Politburo] and was thought to be one of the candidates for Chairmanship
* Pēteris Stučka was a staunch communist, and [a member of Lenin's internal circle] and was interned in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis after his death in 1932
* Jēkabs Alksnis was the [commander of the Red Army Air Forces from 1931 to 1937]
* Mārtiņš Lācis was a staunch communist, [a member of the "cheka"] among other things and thought up this "wonderful" bit:
> "We are not fighting against single individuals
We are exterminating the bourgeoisie as a class
Do not look in materials you have gathered for evidence that a suspect acted or spoke against the Soviet authorities
The first question you should ask him is what class he belongs to, what is his origin, education, profession
These questions should determine his fate
This is the essence of the Red Terror
* Roberts Ēķis was instrumental in [the repression of "kulaks in Siberia]
There is an old wives tale that at one point Latvian was spoken so much in the Kremlin, that Stalin had to issue an order that only Russian is to be spoken in the Kremlin
Not really sure about this bit, though the NKVD did carry out [the Latvian Operation] that "liquidated" Latvians in the political and cultural sphere in Russia, including almost all of the people named above
holy fuck
They were kinda neutral as in they worked both sides, like deporting refugees back to the Soviet Union and its controlled territories where they were promptly disposed of
Mainly three reasons:
* most land in Latvia back then was owned by [Baltic German nobles] and Latvians were used as labor
A promise of "workers freed from chains" resonated quite well
* the territory of Latvia was ravaged during WW1, people had no food, no medicine and no infrastructure
Germany was the aggressor so the Bolsheviks had an easy time promising starving soldiers ownership of land and riches
* Lenin promised the riflemen an independent Latvia
In the process of the war a substantial number of Latvian riflemen retreated along with the Russian 12th Army, after the [German offensive against Riga in 1917] later, following further German offensives in 1918, retreating from the territory of Latvia completely
In Russia, they announced their allegiance to the Bolsheviks and were from then on known as the ["Red Latvian riflemen"]
Afterwards, Lenin did kinda come through on his promise, though, obviously on [his own terms] even though the Republic of Latvia (modern Latvia) had already been founded in Riga
The conflict between the Republic of Latvia (Latvia) and the Latvian Socialist Soviet Republic is known as the [Latvian War of Independence] and culminated in the defeat of the joint Red Latvian Riflemen/Soviet forces at the Battle of Daugavpils
Some 12,000 former red riflemen returned to Latvia post-war, on the promise of amnesty (upheld 100%), while many others didn't share their optimism (they were branded as traitors by the riflemen in Latvia) and elected to stay in Russia, using the contacts they made during the war and rising through the ranks
The people I mentioned in the post above mostly come from this group, along with other Bolshevik sympathizers and others simply running from the law and finding solace in a new place
This was the easiest to find in English:  but I've read about civilians being returned to USSR as well
The Swedish government did eventually apologize and they did offer a lot of help during the restoration of independence, almost as much as Finland did for Estonia, so we're not holding a grudge, it's just a dark spot in the past
*looks at UK* dammit you bastards
Heeey
Russia has some cool nature and all
I don't want to replace it with water :(
Peter the Great is proud of you
It's already a swamp, how much more water can it get
Woah, when you put it like this
Ok, but only european part of Russia
Also, shower thought: you already live on an island
Very big island called Eurasia
Good luck UK
You're gonna need it
- blame your predecessors;
- blame Brussels;
- prepare three envelopes
Almost getting into war with Estonia over best fishing places in the Baltic sea during the 90's
Soviets occupied Latvia in 1940, so when nazis came around in 1942 we just accepted them as liberators and full on joined them to fight communists
Literally everything
For Latvia it’s when the tzar times broke up and we got independence for like a few years and made a stable country, but then the USSR formed and we were part of the Russians again
getting freedom then getting occupied by ussr then by Nazis then by ussr
"the oldest alliance in the world"
WW2 was just a heated gaming moment for Hitler
Which so weird, cause the Italians had the best rifles in WWI, they started standardising on an excellent rifle for both infantry and cavalry, which was new
They just didn't make nearly enough of them, so the standard was scrapped and they went to the old shitty ones
Yes
I do
My accent is as far from a Latvian one as it could be
I've had trouble speaking to Latvians in English, even if they're fluent in English, because my accent is so different
But if I spoke to a native English speaker outside of Latvia, they would not be able to tell I'm Latvian
My American friends have said that the only noticeable thing in my accent is that I force my t's and sometimes pronounce silent letters
But they also say I have a cool accent, so I'm happy about it
I personally prefer android myself
Most people choose androids because of the specs and the price too
Daugavpils, since it's very ugly and the council of the city isn't even trying to reconstruct buildings nor roads
Daugavpils, it's a shame that it's the 2nd biggest city
Intern who complains about not having a high enough salary, and too many rules

A new hire that does a regular office job
He’s ok although you still don’t know much about him
Seems quiet and drinks herbal tea a lot
It could be any one of us
Latvia would be shy guy
But good at doing job
I knew the public transit was pretty bad in most cities, but I didn't realize to what extent
I went to Orlando FL and stayed in the suburbs (not even that far out though) and the nearest public transport stop for getting to the city center was almost a 2h walk
Also, not needing a special drivers licence to drive a big-ass camper van
In Latvia, I'd need a special licence category to drive one, while in the US I could just hop in and go
The campers are surprisingly easy to drive though
Finally, not a culture shock per se, because this wouldn't be common in the EU either, just a very sweet moment in general - when I first arrived in Orlando, the Uber driver picking me up was this kinda old-ish Latino man who spent the whole 30 min drive to my Airbnb just completely jamming out to Mozart
He was tapping along to faster pieces, sometimes even conducting along; visibly moved by the slower pieces and just generally obviously loving it
The homeless welfare program in colder poorer states is a bus ticket to California
Yea, that's an odd one
Over here sometimes people are addressed by their position, e.g., teacher, doctor, if we don't know the name or don't want to be overly familiar but other than that it's all first names, except very formal situations
> but also the Baltic states
Uh, no
You have to get a license to even get a gun and have a good reason for it
A random citizen will get their request denied
A carry license would be even harder to get
Holy fuck
Ādolfs, Vilhelms and Jurjāns for males
Vilhelmīne, Šarlote for females
Viesturs I think
You brought all the boring ones
And forgot all the hardcore names such as:
For males:
- Maigonis (The Delicate-One)
- Ziedonis (The Flowering-One)
- Ilgonis (The One-Who-Yearns)
- Miervaldis (The Peace-Ruler)
- Laimnesis (The Luck-Bringer)
- Varis (The-One-Who-Can-Do-(It))
- Ilgvars (The One-Who-Can-Do-(It)-Long :D)
- Saulvedis (The Sun-Bringer)
- Jautris (The Fun-One)
- Spodris (The Clean-One)
- Spēkonis (The Strong-One)
- Koknesis (The Tree-Bringer)
- Druvvaldis (The Cornfield-Ruler)
For females:
- Saulcerīte ( The-One-Who-Hopes-For-Sun)
- Sniedze (The Snowy-One)
- Smaida (The Smiley-One)
- Skaidra (The Clear-One)
- Dzidra (The Clear-One) - yes, these are synonyms
- Jautrīte (The Fun-One)
- Veldze (Refreshment)
Historically, Latvia as an independent country is very young
The territory of Latvia has been under German, Polish, Swedish and Russian rule
The names u/FRAX1001 mentioned are of German origin (except 'Jurjāns')
The ones I mentioned are of definite Latvian/Baltic origin
There are also some old Scandinavian names to be found as well (like Ilmārs, Dagmāra)
So, to be accurate: There are many old names to be found in Latvia, which come from other cultures
But the traditional Latvian ones are, definitely, the most fun
But a lot of these names are still in common usage today
My neighbour is Dzidra
My family includes Ilgvars, Ilmārs, Skaidra
And Šarlote
Yes, some of them are still in use for sure
And still may be considered old-timey and old-fashionable
The 'translatable' Latvian ones are hardly used for people born in Post-Soviet era
I think it may have to do with the anti-Russian sentiment in the Soviet era that Latvians gave their child a name such as Ziedonis
To give that name today would mean the child would be teased at school
But the Germanic ones like Šarlote or Gabriēla are coming back
If you wish to have the really old, seldomly-used Latvian names, then, of course, these would be the pre-Christian ones like Namejs, Kaupo, Vetseke, Lokers etc
Edit: formatting
Are there really people in Britain with first name: Stevie-leigh, Anne-Marie, Bobbi-leigh, Carla-Mae, Demi-rose
They all sound American to me
Who knew
That doesn't really happen but I do forget a lot of words in Latvian and I have to translate them from English
The word that I somehow keep forgetting is "watermelon
" It just sounds so different in Latvian("arbūzs")
Sometimes I pronounce some Latvian words in the way I would read them in English
For example, there is a sign near my house with the word "banknote" on it
The word is same in both languages but pronounced differently, when I first saw it my brain kinda stopped for a second
It's also very hard to switch between languages
I would be talking to my American friends and I would tell them what a word is in Latvian but right after I use the Latvian word my brain just switches to Latvian
Often when I need to translate two words and use "and" in the middle, I accidentally use the Latvian word "un" for it
When I need to say an English word in a Latvian sentence, I always say it with a thick Latvian accent, and my brain doesn't really switch to English
It's weird lol
This doesn't happen to me probably because English is very different from Latvian but sometimes when I start to analyze my native language it seems very weird
the fourth point is really similar here
We had literally the same shit about Norway making the rounds about 3 or 4 years ago
It was quickly traced back to a Russian propaganda organization (no surprise there) but there are still believers holding out to this very day
This myth was quite prevalent something like 10-15 years ago in Latvia
It originated in Russia, supposedly because of a book written by some Russian woman that **supposedly** married a Norwegian and then had to run with her child when she realized how "sick" the Norwegian society is
She also claimed that boys get taught to dress like girls in school and all sorts of other crap
The book has been translated into several different languages and published in most former Soviet block countries
Personally I don't buy it and I think it's deliberate propaganda smear piece, especially judging by how wide it's spread
It's not because of some widespread animosity against Norway, the story was spun by Russian propagandists because there was a Russian family in Norway where children were taken away by the Norwegian CPS, and as a matter of policy, the Norwegians couldn't and wouldn't comment anything on the case (to protect the children and their privacy
) This, however, let the enraged parents come up with the wildest claims and no one could say anything to disprove it
Then the Russian media latched on to it, the troll farms saw an easy opportunity for spreading chaos, and the rest is history
I know that because they did exactly the same over here:
One politician, when the epidemic started here continued to go to work and break quarantine, it later turned out that he had COVID-19 and that he lied to the doctors and everybody else about being abroad and meeting infected people
I can't, he's just special in that way, he's done many other stupid things
Iceland is my favorite country so I never forget that
Yes, Hatari were amazing and that is exactly how I started learning more about Iceland and it became my favorite country
I read the comments but I rarely see any Latvian comments
Yep
But a couple years ago I came across some parody organization - Radi-Aid, where Africans crowdsoursing and sending radiators and heaters over to Norway to help these people make it through cold and dark winter
They actually made several pretty good produced videos, including choir songs in support of people Nothern Europe
I think it's quite smart answer to all this huge African poverty nonsense, but unfortunately not symmetrical in terms of the volume
Russia is quite huge
So, surely, as in almost any country, especially big and diverse, there are people who live in poverty and difference in economical climate may vary from region to region
Haha, I'd love to see
Jaj, danke
Isn’t it hi-purr-bowley
Check out the Bristol stool chart
It’s worth it
I thought cottaging was gay dogging ?  Maybe I’m doing it wrong

Sounds about right
Latvia used to have extreme anti-German sentiment in the interwar period, due to the extreme damage caused by Germans invading, but after WW2 and the Soviet occupation, Latvians for the most part just kind of guided our anti-German sentiment towards the Russians, so now Latvia has quite a bit of anti-Russia sentiment
You and me both
Quite often
My native is Russian, but also speaking Latvian because
Because state language, duh
When I was dating a guy who is also Russian, quite soon I inderstood that I cannot remember basic words in Russian and it is a bit hard to communicate in my native language
This always gets me when talking about mechanical stuff
I feel like I know only 20% of all of the terms and lingo in my native language (Latvian), also doesn't help that the older guys adopted the Russian terms for stuff
For example, take the English word "ratchet", in Latvian it's "sprūdrata atslēga" and the guys in the workshop use the Russian word "varatok".
This is a bit tricky question
Technically we have some linguistic autonomy at least at the school level - there are attempts to abolish education in Russian, but the government has tried to do that already 20 years ago
We simply don't have human resources (not enough of qualified teachers who know how to work with bilingual system)
There is quite big Russian-speaking population, so among ourselves we use Russian
But on govermental and higher-education level sometimes I feel like Russian is non-existent
Like, University of Latvia (one of main universities) e-studies page has Latvian, English and Spanish (wtf
) versions
But no Russian
But to be fair, in universities majority of us has to stick to English materials
Because there are not enough translated resources
We have some political pro-Russian parties, but one of them is just meh, would never vote for them, and another one always turned out to be in opposition despite gathering the biggest amount of voice
I feel that as a citizen I don't have voting rights if I don't vote for 'correct' political power that states that Latvia is only for ethnic Latvians
Which is hilarious because this land never was mono-ethnic
I'd say Russian is more available in commercial sector
Job ads quite often require knowledge of Russian
Then we had a funny scandal because of that 1-2 years ago with implication that no one has the right to demand knowledge of Russian for a job
That person had no issue with English though
I could drag on and on, but basically this is the result of post-Soviet Latvian goverment denying local Russian community citizenship which was promised in turn for supporting separation from USSR
We still have non-citizens here who refuse to take naturalization exam or learn the language properly
And I get them, because the heck
They risked their lives during barricades alongside with ethnic Latvians
Don't get me wrong, I rarely have problems just because I'm Russian in daily life, but on political level sometimes I feel like a mudblood in Slitherin
IT here, our anglo-latvo-russo (with some Finnish and Swedish additions) technical language is something to behold
Well, with citizenship things are finally changing - from 2020 children of non-citizens will have Latvian citizenship by default
I think European Union finally started to pay attention to this issue
And thanks for pointing out that there is an issue with political representation in general
A bit hard to see it in overall context when it used to be tied to ethnical stuff all the time
Don't drink and drive
No licence for 5 years
4000 euro penalty
Confiscation of the car
Mandatory medical checkup s. New license again from 0
- test etc
Don't piss on monuments
Long story short
Just don't do it
For a while i thought Baden and Bavaria was the same place haha
>Thinking we are Russians
As a Latvian, I get you perfectly and can feel your pain
I feel like to a lot of non-European people Europe is England, France, Italy/Spain and Russia (+Scandinavia, if you're advanced), take it or leave it
As a kid I used to really respect this, however lately I've been fed up with old ladies that will take a seat on a packed bus and use the seat next to them to put their 100 grocery bags on, pester you about giving up your seat (verbally or by standing and staring at you) even though there are a ton of free seats, or those who can stand fine yet will use their age as an excuse to not give up their seat to someone younger who'd have objectively harder time standing due to obvious medical injury/condition
From now on I only get up if the bus is completely full and the person really looks like they have difficulty standing
hi neighbor
it's very similar here :)
same thing here
You English are cheeky cunts
I've never considered Italy and Spain to be interchangable
I think they have vastly different cultures
I meant the "/" as in some non-euro people choose to see Spain, some Italy when it comes to  what they consider the typical "sunny vacation destination" European countries
Not sure how to word it correctly
Sorry if I offended anyone :(
I know old people like that
I have never met your grandpa and *I* can tell you at least 10 reasons why *his life* was better in communism
Number one - he was young and healthy, and so on
That doesn't mean it was good, or it's better in general
It's a safety thing these days, so one more excuse for that
Well, we were the ones oppressed, so not really awkward from my side
Estonian police has come up with new way to punish drivers going a speed limit
The Estonian police has come up new way to punish drivers who break the speed limit on the highway
They call it "Stop and calm down" Basically they get a choice either pay the usual fine or just stand at the side of the road for some time
Depending on how severe the speed the driver was going over the limit the drivers might have stand at the side of the road from 30 minutes up to an hour
What do you think
Do think this might help against speeding drivers
When Brooklyn 99 tried to have a guy speak [Latvian ] they butchered it real bad, the security guy at least could be understood, but it seems like he really tried to sound like a stereotypical Russian, which Latvian sounds nothing alike
But when the cop speaks Latvian, I could not even understand what he was saying most of the time
They made the typical mistake of assuming that Eastern Europe = Russian
Not a film, but a tv show
"Brooklyn Nine-Nine" used Latvian
I've never seen the show, all I've seen of it is just this [scene] in which they speak Latvian
I can't understand 99% of what they are saying, the translations and pronunciations are all wrong
We have articles in major news outlets even upon a throwaway mention of our country
A named character, and especially one with lines is front page news
First of all, what mountans
Highest point in this contrie isnt even 300m high
Secondly, no
We dont greet strangers
If somebody says hi to you, you assume they know you somehow and then spend the rest of the day thinking, who they were
As we don't have any mountains in my country, I'd say no
we don't have mountains but on trails we just smile awkwardly and nod
Priecīgus Ziemassvētkus un laimīgu Jauno Gadu
Priecīgus Ziemassvētkus
What‘s funny is I’ve noticed that most people that say that the EU is trash, done for, and practically on the brink of destruction are almost always from either a Balkan country, or Central European Slavic country
I’m honestly curious about why they seem to think this
I can barely understand the latgallian dialect from the eastern part of the country (some of them consider it its own language)
In Latvia they say that one will end up digging trenches
umm
:D why do you think so
i think the profession is cut out to be filled by robots and machines only in no time
I have to admit to becoming a terribly horrible insanely poorly badly sucking trench digger as I have unsurprisingly little strength in my arms for someone who works at the computer and
draws
I'm elevating pencils, not shovels xd
But that's not meant in a classist way, it's more of a "lol this dude got saggy triceps lmao"
Yeah
anyway, moving on
judging by how offended people get these days a potential war would never ever never ever never ever
never stop because the dynamic these days is overly emotional to which I say the 5 sacred Gs: good god, get a grip girl
We have potatoes
That Latvians are not the same people as Russians
I'm from Latvia and our country is super flat, no mountains at all and the highest point is 312 m above water which we also call "mountain" in out language
Usually any other country in Europe beside Baltic have mountains, so it was unbelievable for them
After some time I was hiking in my country along beautiful river in our national park Gauja, sent them some photos and they still asked me WHY YOU DIDN'T TAKE PHOTOS WITH MOUNTAINS
Well,
We do, but the "latvia no have potat such is life" jokes have gotten to the point where _multiple_ people i've spoken to have genuinely asked me "do you guys have potatoes there
European Las Vegas ? Fuck no
What even is American Las Vegas for
Casinos are a mystery, who the fuck wants to go there
Cesspit including those
No, this year has kinda made want to become an ecofascist unironically
First day that it was hot as hell was a confusing one
I looked at the weather forecast for that day and it said 24°C. Nothing special
Then when it reached 24°C the forecast said it would be 25°C. And it repeated that all the way until 30°C.
Now I just go swimming every day, but the water is getting warmer too
It rains quite often, so that's cool
I'm really not built for anything above 23°C, I hardly got through 21°C in the past normal summers
I also moved into a new flat recently
This flat actually has an AC, which I didn't want to use because I thought it seemed useless after the cold spring we had this year
Now I use it anyway, I just need to get myself an air humidifier because my skin is drying out from the AC dehumidifying the house
With a big appetite for eating other Latvians without salt
How did you end up getting it
Still European
Don't want to be mistaken for a yank
Outer parts of Riga, just filled with commie block bulidings
For me it looked kind of average when I stayed there
Atleast the landscape around it made the town look nice
Chapter 1
General provisions
Latvia is an independent democratic republic
The sovereignty of the Latvian state belongs to the Latvian nation
The territory of the Latvian state, as set by international treaties, consists of Vidzeme (not sure the English name, literally midland), Latgale (Lettigallia), Kurzeme (Courland), Zemgale (Semigallia)
The state language in the Latvian Republic is Latvian
The flag of Latvia is red with a white dash
So fuck the 30% Russians living in Latvia, I suppose
Article 1
Latvia is an independent democratic republic
Latvia is an independent democratic republic
The sovereign power of the State of Latvia is vested in the
people of Latvia
The territory of the State of Latvia, within the borders
established by international agreements, consists of Vidzeme,
Latgale, Kurzeme and Zemgale
The Latvian language is the official language in the Republic of
Latvia
The national
flag of Latvia shall be red with a band of
white
More precise, from the [official translation] (pdf)
Kinda funny, since this constitution was applied in 1922 but in 1934 we became a dictatorship
Might be because Canadian and Australian monarchies are protestant ones, with the monarch having ultimate sovereignty over the church, whereas Spain is Catholic, the church's sovereignty is in Vatican
They are dispersed, though not nearly evenly
A lot more of them East than West
The second biggest city, Daugavpils, I think is majority Russian speaking
I don't think they're a majority on any regional level though
Didn't know there was an official translation, thanks
It uses the word "tauta", which has ethnic and linguistic connotations
It's a bit hidden
It specifically says "the nation of Latvia" and has lawyers fawning over it for such an enlightened, all-inclusive thinking for 1920s, when there weren't 25% Russians living in Latvia
As is ours, it was suspended in '34 and reinstated in '90 partially and '93 fully
Our authoritarian didn't change the constitution of 1922, unlike our neighbours in Estonia and Lithuania
The bit about Latvian being the exclusive language doesn't help either
They created new ones I think when the union fell
Ethnicity is about culture, it's usually the same as parents' and people are not keen to change it, but there's nothing preventing a child of Russians growing up or even living long in Latvian enviroment to fully adopt Latvian culture (also OP doesn't know what they're talking about, you were absolutely right that it talks about  Latvian nationals, not ethnicity)
I know why, I just wish we were above such silly things
Look to your Northern neighbours, 5% of Finland speaks Swedish, for very similar reasons why there's Russians in the Baltics, and it's a recognised official language
Imperialism is imperialism, doesn't much matter if it's 300 years or 800 years
I was a little kid in Mauritius next to a store once and I was like a typical Latvian kid, my skin was light, bright blue eyes and long, thick blond hair
So, a random guy come up to me and strocked my head bc he had never seen a white kid with blond hair in his life
You get what you pay for
A couple months ago I was getting the bus from Brazil to Argentina, and right before the border a Russian couple get on
They're in the middle of a huge arguments where she is basically acting like an entitled spoiled bitch complaining about everything, the bus, her boyfriend, their holiday, their luggage, the other people on the bus, and he's just apologising for it and hoping that she'll stop
Now the way the border bus works, is that locals don't need a passport to cross so foreigners have to get out, get stamped, and wait for the next bus, at both checkpoints
This is fine with us, and the two older German guys also on the bus
They were super friendly, and obviously we were talking in English with them
This wasn't fine with entitled Russian girl who still didn't seem to realise she's in South America, not Russia
She continues to complain about her ridiculously oversized luggage, about how her boyfriend is stranding her in some shithole in nowhere, that no one around them even speaks Russian so she can't even ask for help because we're all too stupid to understand Russian
This goes on for the whole wait for buses, both times, and we eventually get to the town in Argentina with her still acting the drama queen ranting away in Russian
Of course, then she starts a big rant that she's not walking across town to the hotel with her stupidly big bag, her boyfriend either needs to find someone to carry it or arrange a taxi or something
He's trying to finally calm her down as the rest of us get off the bus, and we can't take it anymore
I look up where their hotel is on our map, and walk over with my girlfriend who proceeds to explain to them, in Russian, that their hotel isn't too far to walk and give them directions
The look on her face when she finally shut up, for the first time since boarding the bus, and realised that we had understood everything she was saying, was priceless
This is the way
Latgale, it is the poorest region in the baltics(as far as I know) and one of the poorest in all of the EU's Eastern countries, highest unemployment in Latvia, often disregarded by tourists while having some beautiful sights
There are also plenty of villages completely abandoned, while that is all over the country, Latgale is noticeably more abandoned
Maybe I have a soft spot for the region cause I'm half Latgalian and visit every year
I'm not sure if other languages have this but as far as I know, I haven't seen one besides Lithuanian maybe, but there are only 6 endings and one exception, nouns only have two genders, so most male nouns end with "s" and most female with "a" or "e" . My foreign friends always laugh about how they can take any word, add an "s" and now they sound Latvian
Some people here tend to do that in Latvian too, very rarely though
I think the mild discomfort is a small price to pay for the long, warm evenings in summer and light mornings in winter
The difference is very important the further north you go
Funny, I have the exact same argument but with summer time and how the extra light in the evenings would be beneficial for people coming from work
It's really depressing in the winter when you go to work, it's still dark, go home, it's dark already and you've spent the whole daytime working for the man
Really makes you feel exploited, too
Doesn't matter what time that's already the case as is
We made cake for [Estonia] [Finland] and [Lithuania] on their respective 100-year independence anniversaries
We are the country that gives the most gifts to other people
Latvia is the smallest colonial power in the history of the World
Well it depends on each person, I always refer to Latvia as Eastern Europe because I have noticed it makes more sense to group us with EE countries for economic, cultural, linguistic, historical reasons and so on
Estonia is like 50/50 for me I would call it both
Both as in Eastern and Northern Europe
I’m bad at being a Latvian: I can’t sing, I don’t tend to the cemetery, my room is not laid out according to *āderes* but I do believe that *caurvējš* can get you sick
Any other stereotypes
Brooklyn Nine-Nine
Season 4, Episode 10 - Captain Latvia
There is no Captain Latvia toy in real life and they talk about Latvia like it’s a dump full of people too poor to do anything
Actually any time B99 mentions Latvia, I want to cringe
Nikolaj isn’t even a Latvian name, at least not the way Boyle insists of pronouncing it
Well Latvia is barely mentioned in media but when it is its just Soviet Russia but they can make stuff up or just funny foreigner
Same about the Macgyver episode set in Latvia
It was ridiculous, I laughed all the way through
They got a few names and translations right, better than some other shows, but that's it
Nothing looked even close to Latvia and those events wouldn't even be possible here hahaha
There was some Russian newspaper back a few months ago claiming COVID was developed by the EU in Latvia in order to kill off the ageing population of Italy, or something like that
I can't remember the details, but it was wild
I am imagining a great empire, stretching from Brussels to Vladivostok; Baku to Murmansk, of Slavic peoples
Thousands upon thousands of miles of interlinking Adidas stripes, always an apartment building to squat outside drinking Tyskie or a local equivalent, blasting Russian hip-hop at full volume
Who knows
Maybe we're super suspicious people, or maybe Kremlin is still trying to recruit our (pretty big) Russian population
There are some obtuse people who would like us to reconquer Trinidad and Tobago, and The Gambia
Never mind that 1) we never conquered anything, just bought them; 2) it was a German vassal state to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth that was about a quarter of our country; 3) it was about a decade or two in the 17th century; 4) we've ourselves have been in a similar situation in our own land
Idiots are everywhere
We, Latvians, joke about taking back Ruhnu island back from Estonia all the time
It was our only island and Estonia already has so many
There are some Latvian people (and maybe Lithuanian) who say that Moscow is ours because some extinct Eastern Baltic tribes conquered it from the local Slavs
Ass Nazis in latvian means “sharp knife”
Ass=sharp
Nazis=Knife
In Latvian "ass" means sharp or spicy
Wonder what foreigners think when they can get an "ass" kebab
"Maukas lohi" in Finnish means "tasty salmon", in Latvian "Slut loser" lmao
France, anywhere coastal, I don't think I could live without the sea
Oddly one of the main countries I would like to move to is Croatia, which to you might seem crazy because you are Croatian, but It's so Slavic, yet so beautiful in terms of nature, amazing roads, cool people and so on
Croatia is probably my favorite country from everywhere I've traveled to(which isn't a lot of places but still)
Back when I was in college in Finland I was walking home and a group of Russian tourists approached me and tried to ask me for directions in broken English mixed with Russian words
They were fairly surprised when I answered them in Russian
They asked what I was doing and how I liked it in Finland, and then moved on
To be equally fair, all driving license holders should pass test like once in 10 years
-20°C. At that point it feels like your face is being stung by little tiny needles

I feel that since Latvia has acquired Independence, the key people and parties in the Parliament remained the same
Over time parties changed names and whatnot, but the agenda is always the same
I always vote with the hope of changing that and bringing younger blood into the mix
More often than not for liberals
It's a shame, that they never get much votes
Is it true, that Putin gets a lot of legit votes from seniors, who are used to seeing genseks in power for decades
Saskaņa un ZZS varbūt te ir 30 gadus, par JKP, KPV un citām varētu pastrīdēties
People, who were involved with the Communists are disliked here, so we don't have them in the open
But
Some time ago there were a lot of old school people in politics, of whom you could find out, that they were actually in politics during the Soviet times as well
But they are such low people, that you know they are in politics for being important and for some sort of power, rather than due to their ideological beliefs
That kind of people, which would go into it regardless of the political situation in the country, and would loudly express their support for the dominant political force
In Latvia, when people think we speak Russian
I mean many Latvians (but not all by any means) can speak Russian, sure, but the Latvian language is a completely different language (non-Slavic Indo European) that doesn’t even use the same alphabet as Russian
Well it makes me crazy anyway
I learned this here 5min ago and I ***cannot wait*** to use this to tease local Russians
You seem to have a chip on shoulder regarding English
Is this because of history book
But if he is wrong, why say that makes him an Englishman
As if that was most derogatory thing
Soon Ireland will accept its rightful and welcome place back in the bosom of the UK
I've NEVER seen a woman sunbathe topless
To be honest, I don't think it's even legal to be naked in public
I’m also a former exchange student (went to Germany, too) and I also have worked later for an organisation that does exchange programs
I didn’t google my host family’s name, too, and I am sure they didn’t google me as well (although my full name is unkommon and google doesn’t offer much results about me either)
I’m also not used to google other people
I had to fill a questionnare before my exchange where I had to state everything about me like hobbies, school and medical stuff, so my host family would know something about me and the host family had to do the same, people from the organization went to their home to check whether they actually can host exchange students, so I was sure that everything will be alright
Also I was paying for all of that, therefore I thought I have no reasons to google them
If they googled me, then I would expect them to not tell that to me
That is kinda weird
After we matched, we followed each other on social media anyways
It is extremely rude and they had no right to do that especially when you were with guests
This is not normal
I think that could be a good reason to switch host families
I as a Latvian actually use some old English words like shall, hath, thou etc
since they sound bit more better
Oh, when our Minister of Finance in the interview with Bluoomberg to question about crisis 2008 answered "Nothing Special" (1:30)
It's still a meme here
[Laimdota Straujuma] former Prime Minister of Latvia, speaking at the EPP convention
Came here to post this :D iconic
The Tsar wasn't the only russification enthusiast
The Soviets did it throughout the USSR, and Putin is doing it right now in Crimea
same for latvians
We call it “Jāņi”
My bad yes you are correct
Ah yes my bad
I really think that the holiday is the one i look most forward to
A Latvian, that doesn't have anything to complain about
I'm a Latvian who doesn't like fish and especially sprats
A Latvian who doesn't like sour cream
A Latvian that doesn’t eat rye bread
A Latvian that doesn't eat tasty tasty tasty potatoes
The Sun- Saule(language, female), Saule(mythology, goddess)
The Moon- Mēness(language, male), Mēness(mythology, god)
In mythology, the Moon is actually the Sun's husband
This wasn't in the question, but Earth in Latvian is "Zeme" which is female, and we have goddesses like "Zemes māte"(Earth's mother), "Vēju māte"(Winds' mother), "Jūras māte"(Sea's mother), "Meža māte"(Forest's mother) and "Veļu māte"(Souls' mother)
Saule is sun, which is female, and Mēness is the moon, which is male
Isnt it used for months
Baltic languages, especially Lithuanian, are supposedly some of the most archaic IE languages, retaining the most proto-indo-european features, and in both Latvian and Lithuanian the Sun is feminine and the Moon masculine
Same in our pagan mythology (pretty similar to Norse/Germanic) - the Sun is a major female goddess, the Moon is a somewhat lesser male deity
Is the English being cold really a stereotype
I would understand Finland, and the Baltic nations with that stereotype but not England
I'm not sure if it counts as in history, as he's still alive, but it's Alfrēds Rubiks, probably
Most Russian leaders in general
Well, they didn't say explicitly that it has to be a native or local, so I'd say Stalin
Not sure about the pronounciation, since I haven't really met many people who would speak it as a foreign language
But grammar I'd say is fucked, even most natives don't get everything right
**Grammar** \- Difficult for almost anyone (maybe except Lithuanians)
**Pronunciation** \- Most words have at least one "S" in them, which isn't hard, but the challenging part is the "š" (sh), "ķ" (kj) sounds
Try saying "*Visneiedomājamākais šaursliežu dzelzceļš*".
Overall there are a few cases of people learning the language to almost a native level
**Examples:**
* [American girl learned Latvian in almost a year] Starts at 1:14
* [German guy learned Latvian and a bit of Russian while living in Riga] (you can still tell he's german though)
* [Italian guy speaking fluent Latvian]
* [Canadian guy speaking perfect Latvian]
I would like my country to adopt remote work wherever reasonable
Totally agree
I've seen this said before and it's pretty illogical, if you think about it:
* They can allready and haven't
* This unties work from place
They might lower the salary, but offer it to the entire World, that could rather have the effect of evening out salaries across the World than decreasing availability of the work in richer countries
But it doesn't automatically mean that cheapest labour is always the main factor in hiring someone, you may also want job to be done well and such
* Working remotely doesn't cancel taxes and labour laws
Companies might have problems with lowering wages on one hand and moving to hire outside of their country on the other that they wouldn't want to bother with
* There are jobs that require knowing local language, culture and other things, but not necessarily sitting at a desk in an office
Reallistically companies for which it makes sense, like large multinationals might and likely allready have
For the rest there's plenty of other issues to deal with besides having employees come to office purely out of habit
UK, France and Estonia
Without their help Latvian independence war could've ended disastrous for Latvians
Shit  what happened later sucks, but things are as they are
It's important to keep in mind mistakes done in first half of 20th century so we don't repeat it again and, despite whole brexiting thing, temporary insanity in Poland etc, I think level of ties between European countries would make a  positive difference nowadays
Not in the list, but if a Lithuanian spoke really slowly, I think I could understand most of what they were saying
I feel very European, maybe because I was brought up in a very pro-Europe environment
But I honestly identify myself as a Latvian and equally a European
I have traveled all over Europe, met people, found friends, we are not that different
I've taken part in multiple Erasmus+ programmes and am fascinated by our individual and shared cultures, there is a lot to learn
All of the (US) Americans I've met
they appear to be like us, but there is this underlying thing that makes me wonder if we're from the same planet
I'm glad someone gave you a more comprehensive answer
For me, it's hard to describe
I've felt it during conversations
Like when you watch American series or films and you think "pfff people never talk like that in real life" but then it turns out that a lot of them do
I've always been surprised by the subjects they consider fitting for conversations with strangers, and how they think and talk about things
And, of course, the obvious things like education, healthcare, credit etc
Recently visited with bf from Finland and stayed for a month in several cities
It was definitely not as cheep (except Zagreb) as we expected, and, yes, we tried to avoid very touristy restaurants/shops
Felt like we were expected to spend a fortune just because we were "tourists". The nature and the coastline was still worth the money, tho
Estonia i gues
If I see a Lithuanian in here saying it's Poland or smth, I will be crying in my pillow tonight
We dont really like russians
We love our baltic brothers but we do have a friendly rivalry of who's country is better etc
If Lithuanians are like brothers then Estonians are like friendly rivals
Most country jokes here in Latvia either involve Russia (who frankly doesn’t give two shits about us), or Lithuania, the good old drunk Latvians with socks in their mouths who are in denial :)
We enjoy a bit of friendly rivalry with Estonia
Estonia has the highest "mountain"(more like a hill than a mountain) in the Baltic states
Our highest point was 312 metres above sea level, theirs was 318 metres
We built a tower on top of our hill to surpass the Estonians, but the tower was later demolished because of safety risks
It's pretty much become a joke that Estonia is always better than Latvia
When Estonia got covid-19, we still hadn't gotten it, Latvian Twitter was filled with "Estonia's ahead of us again
I think its the ruling system
Hmm really a hard question
Lithuania are bros and Estonians are our little slow bros
You and me both brother :(
Not liking is putting it mildly for many, but what it is indisputable is that Lithuanian sounds like drunk Latvian
Don’t forget to say that when we built the tower they built a slightly taller one, then we lengthened ours, then they, back and forth like that, until the aforementioned demolition
Also don’t forget our good old buddy Lithuania, weird weird Lithuania
But in a very friendly way, no matter where I would find a fellow from the Baltics, I would instantly feel a good connection
I might say that we're better (in reality Estonia is better), but that would be more of a joke, I still love yall
yes
Eeey ofc we do
Unbreak my
Say you rival us agaaiiiiin
I wanted to say hate, but hate is a strong word and i didnt want to offend anyone:D
We love you estonia
what about that island though
Shit
London, Paris, Frankfurt ... are places to work and live, but I can’t imagine are great to visit as a tourist
Zero interest in visiting Las Vegas or Dubai (although I have been to visit friends who live in Dubai, staying at their home)
Sometimes, you just want nice weather and scenery, but not culture or even other people, so a private villa with own pool and no near neighbours, but within a larger resort for ‘in-villa’ catering and bar service, can be quite nice
Doesn’t really matter which country you are in
Or go exploring, walk, cycle, hire car
Eat out, with the locals, but look for quieter restaurants or un-crowded beach bars
Sometimes lookup the best restaurants on TripAdvisor, start at #1 and go through the list, a different one each night
A real eye-opener on how to tell if TripAdvisor reviews are accurate or not
Don’t really like guided tours or group excursions
Can always google about places
Give anything that counts as ‘nightlife’ an extremely wide berth
I don't like living in Latvia and would like to move to Finland
I don't have a specific reason other than it is a clear upgrade on almost all parameters, plus I really like the culture and language
And nature
the politics and minimum wage are fucked up
especially for the minorities
The country is literally dying out
I feel bad for it
I’d say we are pretty well off, since we are sandwiched between two very friendly countries, get access to the sea, lots of forests and rivers, also pretty good for agriculture, and good mix of summer and winter seasons, so I’d say the geography is perfect
Wait
*looks at Russia*, nevermind
Pros: great sense of humor
Cons: not easy to get it out unless drunk and/or in a sauna
The difference is that Latvia remains Latvia, even if we have a large Russian minority
A third\*
Doesn't mean it's right to look down upon them and imply that Latvia is any lesser because of them
Yeah, one bastard somehow got inside my fifth floor apartment during the night and bit me
That's the first time ever since that has happened in this place
Left Latvia to study in a UK college because there are more job opportunities in the UK
I still love my country but sadly there just isn’t as many job opportunities as I would like and the government is quite corrupt ,and it just looks like they are milking the county for their own interest and don’t care about the people
I do visit my friends and family and make some dentist appointments there once a year
It's Kaka in Latvian :)
Niva still popular out in rural areas
I’ve got one !
It was popular no matter your or anybody else's opinion :D
This explains so much
Sometimes I feel like I would be much more fit somewhere else
I went to Copenhagen for a project and I felt like I belonged there with my host family more than I do at home
Still I love my home
I think for many young people from Latvia the answer would be yes, it's even worse for gay people since I'm pretty sure we're either top 3 or top 5 least lgbt friendly countries in Europe
Northern Europe knows the only real drinking is to get drunk eg UK, Germany, Finland
Southern Europe pretends they are too grown up for this eg Italy, Spain, Greece
But they sleep during the day and have 10 course meals really late at night, so they have their own problems
USA unhealthy attitudes to drink stems from their Puritanical times
Everyone can have guns and take heroin
But drinking more than one glass of red with dinner and you get funny looks
Fuck that
Generally South America is up for a good time and wowzers Mexico there is only one reason to invent tequila
Spanish adults are drunk at home not in the street
I don’t think the OP was particularly talking about only in the street
I'm still not used to the fact that now you can walk on the streets of Riga and hear languages that you are not able to understand (meaning, not Latvian, not Russian, not English)
Also feels realy weird when you order Bolt and you get a driver who won't speak any of those three languages
Never seen a religious billboard in my life
Maybe some charity ad that has a reference to some religious org in the footnote
In Latvia i have only seen one while driving thru the country which wasn’t even a real billboard it was a big ass rag with the text “Love jesus” or something like that
Maybe a few words of lithuanian and definitely not "easily".
None really
Most Latvians can understand a bit of Lithuanian, but the two languages aren't mutually intelligible
Then there's Latgalian, which a lot of people outside of Latgale claim is just a dialect and not a separate language but, even so, people from the rest of the country will only understand about 25% of it at most
As I've seen in Lithuania I saw a lot čeburekai stands
I was travelling through Siaulia, there's a lot of them
Living in Latvia, can confirm flags are everywhere, all the time
There are some days in Latvia where every household gotta display flag (yeah it's in constitution)
If you don't display you can get a fine
In Latvia is compulsory to own flag and fly it on official “flag days” which there are several per year
Flag days:
* 25 March (in mourning) — In memory of victims of communist genocide
* 1 May — Constitution Day, Labour Day
* 4 May — Restoration of Independence (1990)
* 14 June (in mourning) — In memory of victims of communist genocide
* 17 June (in mourning) — Beginning of the Soviet occupation in Latvia
* 4 July (in mourning) — In memory of victims of the Holocaust
* 11 November — Lāčplēsis Day
* 18 November — Independence Day (1918)
* First Sunday in December (in mourning) — In memory of victims of communist genocide
I notice in UK, Scottish and Welsh flag are often displayed and seen as friendly and patriotic
However English flag is only to be displayed by extremists
UK flag is seen as global brand, so begins to be disassociated with the actual nation state a little no ?
No, it's not
It is quite common here in Latvia
I only see the welsh flag on Rugby days
No they give you 40€ fine ( not large fine, but still ...)
In the first case, it would not be punished at all, since it is no longer illegal for private persons to not display the national flag on national holidays, and it is also not illegal to fly a foreign flag (to my knowledge)
The second case is an entirely different story
No, there would be like 1000€ fine, I really don't know all fines, but about 1000 euros I have heard so
Oh god, same
The worst part is that most people think that cynicism equals intelligence - "look at me I'm so smart I know that life is shit, ~~wubalubadubdub~~"
Fuck no, most of the time that means that you only know how to echo empty talking points fed to you by society, and most likely don't have the emotional intelligence required to deal with the negative aspects of life
Folk dancing and choir, I'm quite sure this is the same for most Latvians
Currywurst
Definitely not
We already have so much junk food and fast food - both American and Soviet, chain and indie
Would much rather see something original
Interesting, in Latvia Hesburger is usually seen as the ghetto version of maccies
Although judging by the other replies to your post, it might be a personal preference thing
I like Hesburger because they usually have a more diverse menu than McD, and you also have them all over the country, as opposed to McD which is in Riga and only one or two outside of it
I’ve been to that Pret a lot
Hesburger is good
I'm from Latvia
But I stopped buying there because of one stupid policy they have
I ordered the food before on the app
But the app lagged out and ordered to the closest Hesburger to my work not my place
So I called my colleague who's was still at work
I asked him to drive to the Hesburger and get himself a free meal
He drove there , he was like 30 min after I ordered
Hesburger has a stupid ass policy that if your late, they will trow the food out
So all they could give him was the drink
I was so pissed at them and swore to not buy anything there again
It's so bs that they trow it out
Lies
I've bought fries and burgers that have been ready for longer than 30 min
Fuck that
Ive been to Helsinki hesburger
Its the same thing :D Even the coupons work
But it was a bit more expensive
My favorite was the Kebab burger with chilly sauce
In a year i will probably think of forgiving them
Yeah I think it was
But that's bullshit
I seriously doubt they 100% commit to that policy
They make burgers in reserve and who knows how long they lay there
There is no way they keep track of that
We say "e-pasts" translating to "e-post". I've heard some people use "vēstule(letter)," "ziņa(message)" and "gmails(gmail)" too
Germany/HRE
Russia/USSR
Sweden
Lithuania/PL Commonwealth
Estonia
Maybe because for most of written history we were mostly the same country (Livonia)
In some ways CS:GO is worse than EA games, since what you get is transferable, therefore sellable for real money
When you buy a loot box in Overwatch, you know you that what you get has $0 value
When you buy a case key in CS:GO, you are actually betting $2
5 of real money with the ability to win anywhere between ten cents and a few hundred dollars of real money
Yet, this isn't actually regulated like real-life gambling, and payout ratio is way lower than what casinos are legally required to provide
No age restrictions either
There's also an ecosystem of third party gambling and betting services that use CS:GO items as currency
Also unregulated, obviously
We get a few Moomins templates coming up here too
Lithuania and Estonia
we've been through mostly the same shit together
Lithuania and Latvia are a pretty strong pair
It's little to no difference if a Latvian meets another Latvian or a Lithuanian anywhere abroad and the other way round
Both would be really happy
Latvia and Lithuania without a doubt
Both country’s have similar Baltic languages and been through a lot historically
Do you guys call Estonia lil sister or something
We all know your opinion
Honestly, I see them the same
If I see Estonian in a game or whatever I'd say "Hiii brooo
I'm from Latvia
" and most of the time we would be very happy, but sometimes this Estonian can be a Finland simp that thinks that they above us or something and don't belong to Baltic States at all
Before learning about all this Finland simping I treated Estonians exactly the same way as Lithuanians, but now I'm a bit more careful
I'd say that all my friends feel about Estonians the same
We have a ton of shared history both with Estonians and Lithuanians, especially in the past 100 years, and we love them both very much
EDIT: me and all my friends also cheer for every baltic state in sport and stuff like this
To me it's kinda like we have 3 national teams
Can't see that it's true for everyone because I don't know really, but I thought I would let you know
we pretend to be happy but we're really not
I didn't even mentioned Latvia, m8
more like "the further south the more skilled you are at hiding the emptiness"
Already beautiful as it is
Wouldn't change a bit
Albeit I'd make the [Presidential Standard] as the main one
Simply a black cross over what it is now because that's what government does to the land I love so much
I think it's not only like that with Latvia
I'd like to avoid our flag being just another boring tricolor and it being mistaken with Austria, so I'd make the white and maroon play out more like the [belts from our national costumes] something like [Belarus] or [Setomaa] And honestly, even [the preliminary interpretation of the national flag] would be nice
Alternatively, the [merchant navy flag of the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia] is also somewhat iconic
The picture, however, displays a coat of arms as I couldn't find a flag
Not as cool as it's backstory though
Smart ass
True that, brother
I wonder how close we are to one another rn haha
Riga atm
One matched
How close to Akropole
Across the river in a straight line
Wow cool okay good night then buddy
People (mostly americans) who have never heard the language immediately think it would be like Russian cause "pOSt SovIeT cOuNTrY", but me and my family were in Austria once (so German speakers) and a couple of people said that they felt like they're listening to German but somehow cannot understand a word
I would like to hear more opinions though, since it's hard to look at your language from a non-speaker point of view
Whenever I hear Dutch it always feels like they're speaking English but the second I try to pay attention to the conversation they switch to German
And so I'm constantly trying to figure out whether they are speaking English and I don't understand for some reason or German, and then I'm like "oh wait, Dutch".
From what I've heard Icelandic is one of the only languages that pretty much haven't changed since the Viking ages so it would make sense that it sounds historic and viking-y. Not 100% sure if it's true though
Suprisingly Latvian has a lot in common with German
I didnt realise it until I started to learn German
Same
Love you, Iceland
Yes we do, it really means a lot to us that you recognized us as a state
Džon meid hiz vei srū ze dāk forest, onlī tu faind aut zat hī forgot ze monī.
We don't really have the "th" sound, so depending on the word, s/z/d is the closest approximation
Džān meid hiz vej trū d dārk forest, onlī tu faind aut det hī forgāt d manij
Džon mejd iz vej tu a tāvern frū da dork fārest, onlī tu faind aut det hī forgāt da mānij
Džon meid his vej tū a tevrn trū de dārk forest, ounlī tu faind aut det hī forgat de manī.
Jānis, izgājis cauri tumšajam mežam, bija pienācis pie kroga, tikai lai uzzinātu ka viņš aizmirsa paņemt līdzi naudu
Covid, unsurprisingly
We rode out the summer as the poster boy of Europe, everyone forgot everything, and now it's back with a vengeance
Apart from the usual idiots, people seem to think that if they, like, really really need something then by sheer force of will this cold heartless virus will not infect them
Back in spring through sheer luck we got ahead of events with the isolation rules, soft lockdowns, etc
- our stats were so low, we could get by even without masking rules, apart from a brief period of masks in public transportation
Right now we're skating to where the puck is right now, that is, catching up and reacting with inadequate measures while the stats get worse and worse
Doesn't help that half the population are idiots subscribing to some conspiracy theory or other
How does the decapitation fit into this - did the professor criticize islam or was he/she muslim
The nature thing is also that you're more likely to go outside the big cities, maybe go camping, that could bring the total cost down
Just the plain tourist experience in the big cities could get costly
same here pretty much
Reminds me when an F1 driver (I think Nico Rosberg (now retired)) splashed champagne on the podium, on Vladimir Putin, and many in the racing world said the same
Well this is one of the nicest subs out there, and I’ve learned lots just by reading stuff here
By proxy, my boyfriend also learns since I tend to read stuff out loud from here
Love you fellow Europeans
And everyone else - you’re ok too
[Saule, Pērkons, Daugava]
Could be familiar to some Catalonians as well
Either [Sun, Thunder, Daugava] or [The Eternal Milkyway]
Suprisingly a lot of people and a quarter of them are probably tourists
The old architecture is pretty cool but the further you go from the centre, the trashier it gets
Lived in many different parts of Riga, while it's light out it's nice and everyone usually minds their own business,  when it gets dark there are some places that you shouldn't go to, old town and city centre is usually safe, in some parts it's quite dead at night, where I currently live I can hear some illegal racing between 00:00 and 04:00
I hate public transport
Bums, teens, drunks ... No private space
Covid 19 - masks
Isn't this being done kind of already
I know in Latvia they are building the Baltic Rail to unite the Baltics with central Europe and I've definitely heard about train projects all over Europe to connect to the bigger countries
Edit: i think they promised until 2040 for all trains to be up and moving
Can you tell me more about this
This is the first time I've heard this
I did hear about this in the news
I thought it was super cool :)
In Latvia, it's the pronunciation of November (Novembris in Latvian)
Half of the Latvians believe it should be pronounced as Novembrees (with straight thick O), while the other half (including me :) believes it should be pronounced Nuovembrees . Basically, there's no rule for how to pronounce this word and both pronunciations are correct
Whether okroshka is made on kvass base or kefir base
Realising your friend knows your other friends, and thet friends friend knows your friends as well etc
and then you say: damn Latvia really is a small place
We have a bridge in the capital Riga called "Deglava tilts" it was deemed unsafe for loads over 30 tonnes, so they decided to rebuild it, along with a new road for pedestrians
They did the pedestrian part in 2 years, TWO YEARS
And they still have some barriers left, so its not reaaaly finished
And on the "making the bridge safer part", they put some big steel stuff on 1/8th of the bridge, its still unfinished for 2 years
No worries, we got your back (at least to distract some attention)
Riga has zero decent concert halls to be labelled national concert hall
The national symphonic orchestra is performing in a lovely but cramped 19th century building (Lielā Ģilde) in the Old Town and no government can come to an agreement where to build the new one and they've been looking for a location for at least 10 years now
Meanwhile, newly built concert halls are popping up in every self-aware small-town, one of those with a rather cocky city mayor just opened a concert-hall named Latvia (in a town of some 30k residents)
People have bought out all of the face masks, yet I have not seen a single person with a face mask
I can't find any buckwheat, as well
i just realised the latvian word "miers" (peace) probably comes from that
I bet she's really randy
Spiridon is definitely Greek
At least over here there's a certain ultranationalist connotation with those kinds of ancient names
(I mean generally, not just those Russian names in particular
The moustache, too
I mean jeans were original made by Levi Strauss and Jacob W. Davis a Latvian born american
Jacob W. Davis, the man who invented jeans, and then partnered with Levi Strauss to mass produce them, [was born in Latvia] Also the creator of the [Minox Riga] often considered the best spy camera during the early cold war due to its extremely small size, [Walter Zapp] was a baltic german born in Latvia
Latvian invented jeans, so your everday pants has been invented in Latvia
I speak little Russian and now this makes so much sense
There's a thing called Revolut where you pay the same fee everywhere
I believe this was tried in USSR if you want to research the various issues involved .....
Tesla uses CCS for Model 3 and includes a CCS adapter by default with others
What
Transfer money to Revolut, it costs like 40c, and then use a Revolut card for an ATM
A simple Rev card costs is like 7 euro for 5 years
And take out money for free All over the Europe 50 times a year or something like that
Yes, we have the Russian gauge for our current railways but the new [Rail Baltica] is built in European standard gauge
Not true
Visa is global
Revolut cards use Visa, no one can track you
It's your bank's issue, it's stuck in 20th century
Change local bank or just transfer your paycheck to a Revo card
Probably the issue is that it's you countries fault you don't have euro as a base currency
I can withdraw much more as a Eurozone citizen
I think Quisling is used much more widely than English
Even we use it despite the Iron Curtain, albeit not that often
Ah, could it be any other country to give birth to world's least violent game
They wanted or it happened and they decided to make the most of it
I’d like to thank the Lithuanians, for fighting the oppressive crusaders around 700 years ago, and later making them their vassals
If it wasn’t for them, the Baltic would’ve been completely under crusader control, and the Baltic might’ve been completely germanified by today
But Latvia
This isn’t just in Latvia, but also in Lithuania, Estonia and quite a few Slavic countries too, but [Kvass]
yeah, we love it here
Yeah we have bottled kvass here
That's a good attitude
Something my country desperately needs, a healthy look at history unclouded by nostalgia and mystified origins of the nation
English
Also, I don't think games get translated in Latvian anyway
But even if they were, I'd pick English
I prefer playing games and watch movies in English, since translations are not always accurate and sometimes it seems weird not sure why
Games are never translated in my language, but even if they were i would probably play in english
I read harry potter in Latvian first and i had a hard time understanding which charachter was which in english, bc the names in english were very different, and i wouldn't want to deal with that again
Never seen this even tho we used to get a lot of snow, educational
Thank you
12th of January 1969 a residential building exploded due to a gas leak,  the explosion killed 41 people, among them 14 were kids
The Soviets did their best to sweep this under the rug, and was only widespread knowledge after the collapse of the USSR
I cant remember any, probably some explosions during WW2
Bridges or smth
As I'd heard it, those were the ambassadors of those countries that met regularly to exchange the post
I hope they're lying for marketing's sake or that's an E.Coli outbreak waiting to happen
Urine does
Russia invaded Ukraine, so Americans boycotted Latvian vodka
Building 5-6 floor buildings is more manageable and cheaper and friendlier for environment
No need for expensive projects and elevators
It's also better for transportation
No need for wide roads and a lot of cars
Public transportation becomes convenient
It's more secure as anyone can leave a house fast in case of emergency
Plus it fits in historical architecture among houses which are very old
"Gatavs(i) vai nē, es eju meklēt!"

We have a brand of baby diapers called "Pamper" and by thid point a lot of people don't even know that pamperi is not the actual word for diapers

I would argue that [Bankomat AB] appears to be founded in 2010, whilst we have definitely had the word for a long time before that
In Latvian there is just this one word 'bankomāts', no other synonym
I just had a look at the Latvian newspaper archive periodika
lv, here's an [article] from 1990 (when Latvia was not yet independent), a regional newspaper had published a helpful article on how these cash machines work and on the plans of the [still existing] Soviet Union to introduce non-cash transactions
Edit: When I talk about 'we', I mean society at large, not just those speaking Latvian
Edit 2: I might be wrong – after reading the Wikipedia article more closely (my Swedish skills are rather basic), I see that the company is older than it appeared at first glance
Thanks for the clarification, I take my words back
What about Swedish language, do you have any other synonyms you would use besides 'bankomat'?
For some reason in UK they are called “cash point machine” which seems clunky and takes longer to say than “ATM”.
"Pūķis" is word used for both
It literally means a dragon
Sometimes you call kite "gaisa pūķis" which means air dragon
Yep
In Latvian we have "pūķis", which means both kite and dragon
While "gaisa pūķis" is absolutely correct, it feels *so* weird to say it
But I don't have conversations about kites often, so it might be just me
ye, especially when most dragon depictions for Latvians is ones who can fly, so I kinda see that addition as redundant as well
Drunk british tourists pissing on our freedom monument
And when I was in Croatia Plitvice lakes a lot of tourists where feeding the ducks and fish(a lot of signs indicate that it's forbidden) by throwing bread in crystal clear lakes
Most of it justs floats there uneaten (fish and ducks are overfed and don't want to eat anymore) and ruins the view
Piss on the freedom monument
Oh, they're there
I meet Latvian speakers in all sorts of places
Russian, 30 percent of our population are russians
The 2nd biggest city in Latvia has more russians than latvians, it's quite sad really
Technically illegal but not enforced AT ALL and easy to acquire
Hell, I went to the No
1 high school in the country and a TON of super smart kids with bright futures did it, so yeah, not a big deal here
I think it is quite popular but not too often used by teenagers 14-18 years old and young adults too
In general if you use it i think most adults who don't know anything about it would consider you a junkie
> most adults above 40 years old think that cannabis is as bad as heroine while they drink spirits every evening
A lot of hypocrites here
This
Fairly popular among young people,  most people I know have smoked it at least once
Then there is split - who loves it and use occasionally or who dislikes it and stays with drinking
But overall in my social circle it's well tolerated
So you make all girls, whose dad happened to have name with g at end, feel like he was a piece of shit
Thus is a really weird way to practice generational curses
In Latvian there are two words for it : *sliedes* (track) and *dzelzs ceļš* (iron road)
Yes there are a few forests where you won't find anyone or any buildings if you walked for hours
Though realistically they aren't big enough to get completely lost in
Considering that a lot of our country is occupied by forests, yes
Which ones
The Coast of Northern Kurzeme is one of the main ones, since it has very few villages on the way and most of the forests there have been untouched in decades
The second main contender i can think of is a forest which as far as I know isn't named, so I will just explain its location
Its the forest roughly between Aizkraukle, Valle and Sproģi. And the surrounding forests around that one are also quite large and empty, well when it comes to Humans or human build structures, there are plenty of Wolves and Lynx in that area
Our current head of state (prime minister) was born in another country (US
It woudn't be very controversial since 2 of our formers presidents were born outside Latvia
Vaira Vike Freiberga was born in Canada, I reckon, but Raimonds Vejonis was born in Russia
Oh and our Prime Minister Krisjanis Karins was born in Delawere, USA
Cant think of anything, Latvians, help me
Only one in Latvia would be Sputnik, since they're posting Russian propaganda
Baltics stick together
Always
Yeah I've seen a lot of people (including me) wear them here
Boys use really racist and sexist and based jokes while most of women are offended by everything
It's sad, but true
During the 2018 Song and Dance Festival closing event, our previous president Raimonds Vējonis had a bit of a mishap with his speech
Basically, he misspoke a lot and at one point called the Song festival (dziesmu svētki) - "Christmas" (Ziemassvētki),  the wind blew away his notes, and at one point just honestly said: "I'm sorry, I'm very nervous
The amazing thing here is that his last name "Vējonis" derives from "vējš", which means "wind".
Honestly I can feel for him here
I'm very nervous when it come to public speaking and I tend to stumble over my words when I'm nervous as well
Same, it was a very human moment
Currently it's no buckwheat
In Latvia yesterday was made the decision to close all schools, kindergartens and Universities from today
Half of my office is empty, because people stayed at home with their children
But not everyone can work from home
Conservatives right wing, LOL
They are centre with a leftist bent
UK people don’t know right wing
I think OP is talking about present day, not 30 years ago
Most Redditors were not born when Thatcher was already done
And her reforms have stood the test of time - no one seriously proposes undoing any of Thatchers changes,  neither modern Labour nor LibDems nor Conservatives
The benevolent liberal socialist society of today, as represented by both the Labour and Conservative parties, was partly shaped by Thatcher - certainly the freedoms enjoyed by individuals and private enterprises to stand on their own feet and demand more from Government, rather than simply accept their place as a cog in the wheels of the state run society, and a condescendingly patriarchal society at that
The UK now would be a very different place without the Thatcher years and I don’t assume 100% “better”.
Who is this person
You mean liberal wet Boris
LOL
Whoever described him like that should take a look at party leaders across Europe
Even that EU data oriented website lists UK Conservatives as centre-right and UK Labour as centre-left
It’s like splitting hairs
Only the people in the UK want to make a big polarised tribal argument out of it
In reality, if UK had some of the really right wing parties from other European countries then they would really have something to complain about
As it is they just bash soft Boris
Wasn’t Ken Livingstone referred to as “Red Ken” and during his GLC years affiliated with Militant movement ?  Maybe his view is not 100% unbiased
Well I wasn’t speaking as a political scientist
But as an outsider from another European country, seems both main UK parties have policies to sustain some form of free market liberal socialism, just with balance between social policies and market policies slightly different for each party
Where I am from doing this would definitely be a leftist bent
compared to more straightforwardly right groups
Yes thank you that was exactly my point
You call ‘left’ and ‘right’ what other nations would call ‘centerish’.  I think it’s because you all seem to be permanently aching for a fight
I suppose "Nu, labi" would be the closest, it translates to well, ok
Same in Latvian “nu jā” or “nu labi” both Pretty much mean “well yeah “
Pieņemsim and lai būtu are also similar in meaning
A first name and a last name
If parents wanna be really fancy they can ofc give as many names as they like or maybe have 2 last names (for them upon marriage or for their child) for some reason, however this is quite rare
And I'll never understand wtf is a middle name
What about Philippos Andreou of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderberg-Glücksburg Prince of Greece and Denmark
aka Philip Mountbatten-Windsor
aka Prince Philip husband of Queen Elizabeth II of United Kingdom
Farming in a field with a German baron yelling at me

TL; DR: Lots and lots of commieblocks
I wouldn't say that it's any ugly, I really like the looks tbh, but I've heard a lot that this building is really tasteless and not at all attractive
So, would be interesting to hear your opinions on[The national library of Latvia] Designed by [Gunārs Birkerts] an architect known for designing multiple buildings in the US it was his gift to his Homeland
If you ask me personally, then my answer would be very boring
For me, the ugliest buildings in Latvia are three "skyscrapers" 100 meter tall each, built in the soviet times, absolutely generic
One of them has been rebuilt to a hotel, the second is used as a huge ad banner, but the last one standing is still screwing up the riverside view of Riga (all buildings here relate to this city)
Germany has much uglier buildings than that
Usually there are studies about different religions in course of culture history, like basics about the major ones
There’s no other option than Rīga
It’s the biggest city and half the population of the whole country live here
The rest of the country certainly wouldn’t accept a Latgalian/Russian city as the capital so Daugavpils is out of the question
Liepāja could be a potential candidate, but it’s too small and far from the rest of the country to match Rīga
Hah, I did the Trans-Siberian a few years ago; that was an eye opener
Fuck it, Chelyabinsk for new capital
After all, в Челябинске лучше торчать.
I wouldn’t say that: there’s the stereotype of people from there being a bit backwards but everyone gets on fine
There’s a small Latgalian independence movement that none of the rest of the country take seriously though
It’s more that Latgale and especially Daugavpils has a very high (up to and over 50% in some areas) Russian population where a lot of them don’t even speak Latvian
So moving the capital to Daugavpils would definitely be seen as a move back under Russian sphere of influence which most of the Latvian population would resent
Then there’s the language issue for even the non-Russian population, is Latgalian a separate language, or is it a dialect of Latvian
Every Latvian has a different opinion on that, depending on how well they understand Latgalian, which would definitely complicate matter in moving the capital there
I do t think we are important to EU
Heck, most people I have met think Latvia is the same contrie as Lithuania
We on the other hand need EU very much
They help us in so many areas
Our role is literally to be mixed up with Lithuania
English, because of the spelling and all those silent letters
Seriously, why do you need those
And why would you need so many different sounds for the same letters
German, have been learning it for the 3rd year and I cant even make basic sentences, but I started learning Norwegian since summer and i seem to be able to figure out many things right now
They spell long vowels as two letters and these are compound words (this is ice edge according to OP and I think the other one is work night or something)
It's just an orthographic issue
reminds me of old Latvian orthography having neeeeet for modern neieiet
I guess pronouncing the k was too much work for them
Pretty sure this one is intuitive for them
I don't really know anything about the Balkan wars beyond that they happend I the Balkans
>Anything to do with the Baltic States during before, during and after soviet occupation
Post ww1 Baltic States win their wars of independence (Lithuania losses viļņus)
Interwar period Latvia in 1934 has a coup and establishes a dictatorship
that last till 1940
I believe Estonia and Lithuania also had dictatorships at the time
Molotov-ribontrop pact gives the Baltic to the Soviets in 1940 they occupy the Baltics
Then a year in latvian called "baigā gada" (year of Terror)
Where slot of people were sent out to gulags
Then the Nazi come establishes foreign as divisions for Latvia and Estonia and then do Nazi shit the area
Then the Soviets come back and do Stalin shit
Then 50 year of Soviet rule untill
The singing revaluation (1980s) started In Estonia but later spread to the rest
This was a protest to Soviet rule without fighting commutated in the Baltic way (1989) longest human chain connected the three capitals
1990s the Baltic governments vote to leave the Union
1990-91 in Latvian referred to as "barikāžu laiks" (Time of barricades) In which we waited for action Frome both the west and Soviets civilians constricted [barricades] to stop potential intervention
Omon opens fier In the Baltic States (here's a [Lithuania man getting run over]
1991 USSR collapses independence secured start of a lot of political and economic instability crime and corruption rampet
2004 Latvia jons the EU and nato
Estonia Lithuania did the same I. Different dates
A "quick" overview of the Baltics
If you want can do the same for Latvia I the Russian empire
The main event is on the 24th, you would normally go and visit family on the 25th and 26th
Fun fact, Christmas in Latvian is "Ziemassvētki" which directly translates as "Winter celebration", a remainder of our pagan past
Brecon beacons were lovely, coming from a very flat place it was a tough hike up the Pen y fan, but the views were so worth it
And West Virginia is north of Virginia
Technically не isn't a word so that's not really a good example
But yes, it matter sometimes
Russian i dunno why but its really hard and i keep messing it up with latvian language rules
I'm learning German as well and I find it quite easy
I'm fluent in English and a lot of the vocabulary is similar, also I'm Latvian and older Latvian has some German influence (but the two languages are almost nothing alike)
The grammar is a bit tricky but they have strict grammar rules to follow and although I learn German in school I also do it on Duolingo and I learn grammar just through habit
French for me so far
The vocabulary is not that hard but damn why you gotta add a bunch of useless little words that don't translate
The pronunciation isn't that bad either, it just takes practice, every time I try to say something I just imagine that I'm mocking someone and it works
Given that I'm trying to lose my British passport as soon as possible, I have yet to see a reason why anyone would not be
Honestly I don't trust any kind of Unions
But so far so good
Fuck yea
It's pretty easy to think of them, with my British passport I've not stopped hearing about them for 4 years
How anyone can think there's any way it will be better after Brexit is baffling
I disagree
The borders and all the hassle of going to another country makes one view those people as something more different than they are, the mysterious foreigners, the noble savages, etc
Now you can see that we're all just people
Culture and language should be defined by, well, culture and language, not border controls
And London Gatwick
And, bizarrely, Buenos Aires - last month I got an internal flight in Argentina that was operated by Norwegian
I was confused too
Jackbooted thugs rouse you from your slumber and drag you by the scruff of the neck to the nearest polling station
Esotericism is a relatively big thing, as is homeopathy
Interestingly enough, interest in these subjects is mostly prevalent in younger, decently educated and well-off people
The last big hubbub was about the introduction 5G mobile networks
There was a myth, originating in Russia and then amplified by local "gurus" and popular people in the entertainment industry, that 5G is super dangerous to you and that it's going to microwave your brain, since "it's one the same frequency as a microwave".
In Latvia there are also many women who believe in horoscopes
But there is a bigger population of people who believe in superstition
My family is not one of those, so most of the superstitions I know, I have learned from my BF's mom
Like, why would putting my bag on the ground mean I will have no money
Or cleaning the table with my hand and not a cloth will also mean I will have no money
What do You mean, if I swipe dirt towards the door I will swipe my luck away
So, if I want to argue with a person, I just have to give him a knife (or any other sharp object) hand to hand
What kind of nonsense is this
HOW DO THESE THINGS CORRELATE
No one admits to selling inferior products here, they avoid it by claiming that it’s to cater to different consumer preferences or different purchasing power
I think you might be onto something right there
Have you considered writing a book on the general subject
Why in the Netherlands the bottle of water costs 2 euros
In Latvia 2l of water costs about 30 cents with deposit it is 40 cents, it just surprised me when I saw that big of a price for 2l of water
It's weird I was in the Netherlands in 2017, and when I shopped in local Jumbo the price for a bottle of water was 1
99 or something like that
Oh, thanks for explaining
You talking about Minecraft, right
Me too
First I thought that maybe it is pronounced completely different in Latvian, but no, don't think I have heard of that one
If you want to learn Latvian, the first step would be to forget every language you've ever known
Then learn the pronounciations of the letters
The primary word stress, with only some exceptions, is on the first syllable, so it's not that hard
Then learn grammatical cases and other stuff
Our nouns have 7 grammatical cases: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, instrumental, locative and vocative
Nouns have six declension classes, three for masculine nouns, three for feminine nouns
Then learn idk what there's lots of other grammar rules
Then learn words
No, it's Baltic
Hate that farcical nonsense
But omg did you see Latvia’s backup dancers
Someone should put some stars on that blue banner, maybe in a circle
So the solution is for every country to take in turns trying to conquer the planet
I like it
If you dont close the door she will say:
You weren't born in a tram
My favourite response to the magic word one is to just say abracadabra
Yes we spell it exactly as it sounds
Edit: the answer is actually no because i misunderstood the question
I had Norwegian lessons in Trondheim on Erasmus
We were told that in Norwegian all letters are pronounced
Then I had to pronounce "studenter samfundet" and found out that the previous sentence was a lie
In Latvian, it is also 99% of the time
Though when reading pronunciation is only perfect for new words like 95% of the time because of the letter ''o'', as it has 3 different pronunciations, but a native speaker will be able to guess which pronunciation is used in most cases
No there is because there are some fucky words
Like lauzt which means break
It has three different forms which sound exactly the same but are spelled different: lauzt, laust, lauzst
im dumb, sorry
on about 60% of words you can, but we have fucky words as i said before
For example  Aizkari is pronounced Aiskari, without the z. And with the word lauzt you need to look at the word after/before the word lauzt
So i guess the answer to the original question is no
99% of the time you can spell it correctly though, so, almost xD
"Where the baron goes"
"Šaursliežu dzelzceļš" and "glāžšķūņu rūķīši" are probably the usual suspects
The former is "narrow gauge railroad" and the latter is kinda non-sensical ("dwarves of the glass shed"), it's not really used for anything
"Pretpulksteņrādītājvirziens" (counter-clockwise), "Šaursliežu dzelzceļš" (narrow gauge railroad) or "šis žagaru saišķis nav mans žagaru saišķis ( this bundle of twigs is not my bundle of twigs), but even the latter is quite the challange for native speakers
> And 'Cholmondley' is pronounced 'Chumley'.
That caught me off-guard when I was watching "Taboo".
In latvian we mostly use “Vecīt” which means old man
Sometimes people use “Bračka” diminutive of “Brāli” Which means brother
Recently I've been saying veči a lot, translates to guys or old men
Not yet
Tbh I'm not sure if we have such a thing, at least I haven't heard of it
Watching American movies as a kid this concept would always confuse me
I guess the closest thing would be the so called "landguards" where you do and help with all kinds of army stuff except, from what I understand, you still count as a civilian and you don't have to be 18 years of age to get accepted, also ofc you don't get paid I think
I'd day kinda like an army volunteer
Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong
Not even guilty pleasure but one of the most popular Lavian songs : Bruģis - Kaija
We must travel to a river, a lake or the sea and swim in it when there is 30 plus celsius outside

Nope, either you sign it off before you receive it or you get a paper saying that you have to go to the post office to pick it up

Ugunsgrēks = Fire-sin (fire as a tragedy, e.g. a forest fire or house fire)

I love how I can understand the Lithuanian sentence, even without the translation
I guess that's how similar the Baltic languages are
Same, and I believe it's the same in every language that distinguishes second person singular and plural
A bear
Literally, a single bear and we share him with Estonia
Probably bears, though we don’t have many (around 30 or so I think)
Most of them live around Kolka peninsula but there are some in the east towards Russian border in Latgale too
I’m not sure if any cross the Russian border because there’s a fence through most of it

"Blizzard of Souls" - movie about Latvian independece war
Only rivaled by the magnificent New Kids Turbo
Not only do I know of it, it has a cult film status among many of my friends and acquaintances
I've seen it 10+ times, mostly showing it to other people, seeing their reaction, laughing our asses off together
Not sure how it all started though, I was just another link in the chain of people
As of going international, there was an absolutely exquisite Russian (which is a common minority language here) translation of it, which certainly helped
I haven't seen it in 5 years at least, so it's tough to say, but I can't imagine why wouldn't it be
Well, other than perhaps me becoming more and more dead inside year by year, but that has nothing to do with the movie though
Yeah we even raided those puny americans with their area 51 back in the 17 century
I like that Latvian is quite a rare language, so if I go abroad nobody can understand me
Also it's very poetic and peculiar, but it takes years to understand this as a non native speaker because it ties in with our culture and history a lot
In Latvian you basically have the ability to deminutise (make small/cute) every word
For example,
money = nauda
little/cute/tiny money = naudiņa
dog = suns
little/cute/tiny dog = sunītis
Also, we take a LOT of influence from other languages (swedish, finnish, german, russian), so sometimes we can understand sort of what they're talking about, especially Lithuanians, because we have a very similar language in general
We have this in Latvia, it's beloved by most people but I hate it for some reason IDK why
Very common in everyday language, but shouldn’t be used in a proffesional environment
In highschool I said “okay” to my latvian lit teacher and she threathened to throw me out of class if I ever said it again
I agree, but it worked and I never said “okay” in her class again
Duchy of Courland, specifically - the West one third of current day Latvia
The rest together with Estonia formed Livonia, at that time a dominion of Sweden
Here at least LotR somehow closely followed Harry Potter in being translated, but Hobbit was translated earlier than that
So LotR is translated simmilarly to Potter series and for some reason Baggins was left as in Hobbit, but in LotR turned to Tuntaks, which doesn't even mean anything, and there were other weirdnesses
Actually even with Potter it was a bit weird, although my understanding is that it was common in several languages, I thonk the only fantasy book series they churned out back then in which the style suited was Arthemis Fowl
I noticed that they now also have given this trwatment to ASoIaF, which doesn't even make sense for the most part - there is no way you'd think that's a book for children, which needs to be dumbed down
Supposedly the artworks and relics inside have been rescued:

We don't dislike Riga, I believe
I live near it though
Also, 1/3 of our population lives in Riga
Need someone more remote to confirm
Most people are bilingual (English/Latvian), some being trilingual (English/Latvian/Russian or German)
The only ones not being able to speak any other language, other than their own, are senior citizens especially from minority groups (for example russians)
As far as I know, you can name your child virtually anything you please, provided that the name follows the Latvian orthography (foreign names will have to be respelled, i.e. George >> Džordžs or Georgs)
Should an inappropriate name be selected, the custody court will vehemently argue with the parents about the consequences in the child's life

I grew up on the south coast of UK where France and Belgium were just a few hours boat ride away
Naturally, I assumed that most European countries had similar on their coastlines, and that people in South of Italy or Greece just hopped on a boat to go to Egypt all the time
Wasn't until I was in my late teens I realised how few people in South UK had even bothered to taken that 90 minute boat or 30 minute train to France
Apart from the small roasters, of the more widely available brands it has to be the Costa Rican [Britt] Illy is also ok
I had a French gf, she was an exchange student, it was fun exploring the cultural differences
You definetly hear it less at least in Latvia
The older people probably don't even know  system since it came here  rather recantly from english language
Now younger people use words like milleniāļi or boomeri
But everyone uses general words like (senior - senjors, adult - pieaugušais, teenager- pusaudzis, kid - bērns)
not that i know of
sometimes we say some words quickly and it might sound like a one-letter word, but I'm pretty sure we dont have any
I'm not one to jump in and disclose how much I earn right away, but I don't perceive it as rude
Plenty of my friends have told me how much they make
I dont really know, but I've heard that Albania is pretty muslim and muslims don't drink that much alcohol
Formaly in pre-school class and by the time I allready had decided I like it and it just came naturally to me
What I found helpfull in terms of immersion was Runescape and the option to examine every object in the game for explanation on what it is
In real life I apply the same concept by Googling nearly every word I don't understand
However this is only good, if you allready have decent knowledge, it us not feasible when you have to check everything

Once in a simillar discussion I discovered that in other languages people don't seem to even have a concept of idiomatic phrase for our "What's inside the teddy bear's tummy
", which is really weird since exploring inner workings of things seems to be important part of childhood development and it is usefull for speaking about other things too
On funny level we say that there's soap, when there's a big trouble and call situations and things that are hard to comprehend, and sometimes troubling, butter
Laime Pilnīga, this is my favorite one:
And also not from my country but from Iceland- Hatari
Probably [Laika Suns] or [Carnival Youth]
Riga and Liepaja have a big rivalry in soccer and basketball, when they are playing things get heated and sometimes (not since COVID) there are fans from both sides who get violent with each other, it is crazy
Most of Greek Cypriots that I know would never cross "border" of North Cyprus
They say that for them, Turkish people occupied their land
I’m pretty sure Latvia has about 3-4 dialects/accents
No but we have 4 (maybe 5 IDK Im not so good at history) dialects (divided by past terretorys)
So there isn't very big diffrence but the terretorys are Up, down, (in the past another down but little bit to the right united whit down), right (The most noticable one like good luck understanding what do they mean), left
In latvia there's 4 national states and I know every state has a different dialect but I don't really know if every city has its own
My city, Ventspils, has a different dialect then rest of the country
We don't really finish the words we say like we would say a  word and just toss a few letters out so it sound kinda simpler
I'm a simple man: I hear Bruseles I think EU officials (and a bit of a sprout tho)
Seriously, sure I know where Brussels is, but now it invokes connotation with EU institutions first and in this context never extrapolated on Belgium and its people
I didn't even rememer Brussels was in Belgium
EU has appropriated it, and Belgium is almost never mentioned in context
The "culture" programme in my high school (gymnasium) had a Formal Etiquette subject, but I haven't heard that any other school in Latvia would have that
Also, grades 5-12 we have a sepperate subject to learn our language (grammar, syntax, etc) and a sepperate subject for literature as a whole
I haven't heard that those two would be sepperate elsewhere
1st to 5th grade we could choose one class- religious education or ethics
i'm not religious so i did ethics and we learned about emotions, manners, being kind to people, life goals and that kind of stuff
it was fun because we did some wholesome stuff and played games
we have it too
we also have psychology from 10th to 12th grade
[Valka/Valga] on the Latvian/Estonian border
Well
Valka is literally on the border, the city is split between Latvia and Estonia
Valka(Valga) on the Estonian-Latvian border
Valga in Latvia is a town split in half by Estonia and Latvia
I've heard a lot of the locals know the other side's language, but otherwise probably Russian for people >40 and English for those <40
Latvians see the USSR as a time of suffering loss and repression because we were occupied by it, but many Russians want it back because they want to regain the power and glory they once had as a country
A lot of people in Russia still praise Lenin and Stalin
It's crazy
Yes, I was raised to change when getting home, I buy fleece jackets and sweatpants for this
Anything that is not past Russia's Europe to the East
Helsinki
My girlfriend lives there
Hoping to go there already next week (if travel restrictions are lifted)
As for other locations, Vienna
Beautiful city, and want some sort of vacation this year
Copenhagen, I was there just before they closed the borders on an exchange program, I met a new friend there, but our time was cut short, so I would like to visit her
I also really want to explore the city more, I felt like it was a place for me
We just say "et", so there isn't a fun meaning behind it
Same in Latvian
Never hear of anything other than at
Also means nothing
If Latvia get kicked out of hockey I cheer for either Canada because I have family there, or Finland because one of my best friends is Finnish
It's always fun to rub it in his face when Dinamo beat Jokerit, but still, Finland doing well is inevitable
Aside from San Marino, they're all mega expensive as destinations to visit, and not really worth the money - as someone who's visited every country in Europe
Cool places to say you've been to, but easily as travel destinations you'll have a more enjoyable time in almost any other European country
Politically, well, I dislike tax havens that essentially survive and thrive on the basis of fucking over the rest of us economically, but, they don't seem to be going anywhere
I'd like to see them join the EU to be held to the same standards as other countries and contribute their fair share instead of just reaping the benefits of Schengen, also
Russia who else
Russia, obviously
russia
At least we can sit down in the bar and share our love for ice hockey with you
I wasn't expecting Australian inquisition
We have one chain called Lido which kinda does that thing, they aren't so cheap as they used to be
Business lunches are pretty popular, especially in central Riga, and that's normally some cheap Latvian dish for like €3 a portion or something
Also we have places called "kafejnīca" which is kinda somewhere that's a cafe in the daytime, and a bar in the evening
Or like a mix of the two
Yeah, it's our Latvian fast food chain
Any of them
I mean any one in our language, not that they're all great and catchy
Ohh Ich liebe beide Major Tom-Versionen, und Der Komissar
Ich hab' sie beide gehört lang bevor Ich dieses Post geöffnet hatte
Erwartete nicht diese Lieder hier zu sehen, doch es war eine angenehme Überraschung
(I'm still learnig German, sorry for grammatical mistakes)
Anything from brainstorm
Famous worldwide
The question was never gona be famous
And of course we loaned the German word and have turned it into "špikot" - to cheat/copy and "špikeris" - the cheat sheet
As far as I can tell, these words have no other meaning for us
Latvian is full of Germanisms, at least colloquially
So that's where we got "Špikeris"!
Same here
The noun is "špikeris" and the verb is "špikot".
One that comes to mind is "riktīgs" (Latvian meaning true, proper), coming from *richtig*. You could say
Viņš ir riktīgs latvietis - He's a proper/true Latvian
It's more of an old people thing to say, but I use it quite often in sentences like "riktīgi forši" ("really cool")
There are quite a few German loan words in literary language as well
I'm not that great at remembering things off the top of my head, but here are some I found online: Amats (Amt), bomis (Baum), brilles (Brille), dienests (Dienst), ēvele (Hövel), flīģelis (Flügel), glazūra (Glasur), glāze (Glas), kaste (Kasten), klucis (Kloz), krogs (Krõgh), kleita (Kleid), ķirsis (Kirsche), panna (Pfanne), pudele (Buddel), pīpe (Pipe), spainis (Span), stārķis (Storch), smēre (Schmiere), spēle (Spiel), stunda (Stunde), telts (Telt), zāģis (Säge), ziepes (Seife)
Zapte means jam (the preserve), špannungs - electricity, šlāgeris - old people music
Our school did have lockers before renovation started and 1st graders still do, but otherwise we have a cloakroom and carry our books with us
The lockers weren't owned by the school tho, so if you wanted a locker or finished the school you had to find somebody who wants to sell/buy yours
One year I squatted in a locker, because there were many that were unused
I wanted to buy a lock to lock it but it took too long to arrive and the next year they got rid of them
One of the smallest countries in Europe and we've also got a really old flag
The third oldest in the whole world, actually
Fifth fastest internet in the world
Singing
So much singing, we have a festival for that every 5 years
Live fast, die young
Bosnia and Herzegovina definetly isn't the most corrupt country in Europe so not fully true
And the finno-ugric languages :
-Hungarian
-Estonian
-Finnish
-Saami
I'm not sure
Gibt es etwas (Außer dem Autobahn) das Deutschland macht besser als die anderen
Ich immer noch lerne die Sprache, und will in der Zukunft da leben
Well by almost every metric Russia is the most corrupt country in Europe, and then after that it's pretty much Ukraine, Moldova
And they are noticeably more corrupt than the next 4 countries which are about equally corrupt with Albania and Bosnia & Herzegovina being a little more corrupt than the other 2 which are North Macedonia and Kosovo
I made that a little too confusing, basically the most corrupt countries in Europe go like this:
Russia,
(Slight gap in corruption level)
Ukraine,
Moldova,
(Medium gap in corruption level)
Albania,
Bosnia and Herzegovina,
North Macedonia,
Kosovo
Thank you for that, I did not know there was still such a wide variety of finno-ugric languages left
Nah I love the Autobahn
That's half the reason I'm moving to Germany
But if you don't like it, of course, that's also fine
I love the pretty much free education tho
That's really awesome
Yeah, all of those mentioned are good countries
This is one source that I could give you, it's not perfect though, but it gives a somewhat realistic picture of how corrupt each country is
Some countries corruption levels arent accurate in my opinion, for example from what I've heard I would put Bosnia and herzegovina a bit lower down maybe closer to Moldovas level, though not at that level, and my own country of Latvia I would put a bit lower at probably the high 40s instead of 56
Russia I imagine could be even more corrupt than what it portrayed as in that index, Ukraine maybe same thing
"It is every Germans' contitutional right to go on a family trip in a VW van at the speed of a cruise missile"
This is the best paragraph in the Constitution imo
Only longer distance busses (inter-city) and only when exiting through the front door
No, only times you should talk to a driver in public transport if you need a ticket or if there is an emergency
Why would You do that
Cram through all the bus to get to the front for a "thank You" to a bus driver, who doesn't even care
Who yells through all the bus a quick thanks
We dont do that here
Fuck blizzard
Once I'm out of my sick bed, I'll uninstall overwatch and their launcher too
Spineless fuckers
They and other xi dick sucking corporations are clear remainders that rich people doesn't give a fuck about regimes as long as they are good
Corps should be regulated harder and CEOs and major shareholders should be put on trial for shit they pull
Probably one of the biggest fuck ups company could do
This just gives Chinese influence here even bigger power here and if we all are going to act like those spineless fuckers at Blizzard the Chinese will take over
Seriously fuck Blizzard, fuck their games, fuck the people in charge
In fact, I'm entirely boycotting them (alongside a bunch of other companies for their pro-Beijing bullshit)
I will
I would be quite happy to pay a bit more for components made in Europe, fyi
China only punishes wealthy people who steps out of line or embarrasses Chinese rule
While here in the west, nearly all of them gets away with all that bullshit
They're testing us again to see how we'll react
They need to be locked out of NATO and other alliances because this kind of behaviour is unacceptable
We have nolikt karoti which means to put down the spoon
Y'all greet each other on a forest trail
Even in apartment buildings people mostly don't greet each other, except for maybe in villages where everybody knows everybody
Other than that in Latvia we have something similar - when someone is working outside, you say to them "God helps" ("Dievs palīdz
"), but you have to be at least acquainted to them to say that, too
How do you say the "Strength needed" part in Eesti keel
I have to disagree
We also have an independence day and restoration of independence
And we celebrate our freedom fighters on 11th November
Same shit man
Yes
And Estonians also celebrate independance and regaining of independence
It is a common trait in Baltics
Sveiks lietuviešu brāli
Kaip sekasi
But it is sort of
at least in terms of space, furniture and architecture as that way you have a better grasp on their size comparatively to your body, that sort of thing
For math or physics it does complicate things a little bit
In Latvia, it's Latgale (Lettigallia), mostly because russians are in majority there
Latgale
They have their own language/dialect, most even more of the population is Russian than in Riga, and basically their own music, arts, cultural scene as well
Plus barely any Latgalians move to other parts of the country, even Riga
Every time I visit Daugavpils I feel like I'm in Irkutsk or Chelyabinsk, not in Latvia
Latgale / Letigallia
They speak a dialect that's barely intelligible and are predominately Russian Orthodox
Also, at the time of the Russian empire, they were more integrated within Russia being a part of the Pskov region
Plus they’re catholic unlike the rest of Latvia
Such a weird place
I did the same except I was leaving via Romania and they warned me in Transnistria that the guards on that border get funny about not having an entry stamp, so we went to Chisinau airport and explained to the first security guard we saw that we needed a stamp, and he took us back to the head of security's office; he then had to call the foreign ministry to get permission to give us stamps for coming in through Transnistria
Really weird experience
Or, as many outside of Finland say, Finland doesn't exist at all
But they have a right to bring their children up in Lithuania speaking only Russian and not Lithuanian, right
Same shit in Latvia
Same in Latvia
There was actually a burger restaurant (can't remember the name but I think you have a few of them
) Owned by Lithuanians that opened up in Riga last summer, but instead of hiring local staff they brought up staff from Vilnius and ended up getting a load of fines because customers complained to police that staff could only speak Russian or English, not Latvian
We used to have ministry of E-affairs, which ultimatelly was merged into, along with other things
The ministry of enviorment and regional development, VARAM for short, which just happens to stand for "we can" in Latvian, they're website  lists everything they can on the right hand side, but suffice to say, you might never have expected that you would need to call for tech support to ministry of the enviroment, which is curently very busy with redrawing borders of our regions
Also I find it funny that one of our spy agencies is called Constitution Protection Bureau
Whenever i went to žalgiris basketball games i’d be amazed at how everyone would sing the anthem at the start
Like usually 5-7
Sour and green ones
Cheap ones
Red and big ones, one costs almost euro
I think it's some kind of overcompensation
The Russians I know who are really bad at English tend to omit articles way too much
So I suppose that when they get better at English they compensate by overdoing it
More like
do sex
Yes we do it's called "pupiņu valoda" or "bean language" in english and it's pretty much the same as youre  "bird language" except instead of V we use the letter P
Example ka iet
(how's it going)--->kapa iepiet
(hopo's' ipit gopoiping)
Exactly the same here, idk why
We call it "bean language" (bean = pupa in Latvian
I wish the Nazis and Soviets would have respected my country’s neutrality in WW2, historians estimate about ⅛-1/6 of Latvia’s population was lost
Also this would mean there would be no Soviet occupation, and so Latvia would have kept its prosperity and wealth, and wouldn’t be just a post soviet mediocre country
Ich will in der Zukunft in Deutschland leben

I'm disappointed brialukai
EE food > Southern European food
Kyllä! Unfortunately Latvia is still too corrupt and poor for that
In Latvia it’s definitely [Riga Black Balsam]
Rīgas balzāms, its a balsam, as the name suggests and many say it tastes like cough syrup
It's called balsam here
It's a herbal liquor that's quite bitter, but sugary at the same time
A couple of years ago black currant and cranberry flavored variations came out
Personally, I dislike it, however it's good to "spice up" mulled wine during the winter season
Black balsam, I would recommend the black currant one, it's amazing
I once drank pinecone gin and it did taste like pinecone and grass
As I began to study and understand it from a young age, it seems very simple to me, but I definitely understand people, who find it difficult to learn
In school, we also study German, and I don’t understand a single word
As far as languages go, it's the easiest
It may be hard if you try to build on what you know already, apply the logic and structures of your native language but that only makes it harder
If you treat it as its own thing which does mean different sentence structures, different word order at times, etc
and don't try to force it into something it's not, it's not hard
Plus, it can take so much abuse before it becomes unintelligible and most people are already used to various accents so even if you're bad, at least you'll be understood, even if all you know are a handful of nouns and present tense verbs
My native language is Russian and I consider English to be by far the easiest language to learn out of all languages that I encountered
It has very simple grammar (no gender, no cases, fixed word order), and that allows anyone with a dictionary and time to understand everything
And understanding language is the only way that languages are learned
Elon Musk is an African American
Ķelne (Latvian) = Cologne
Country is called UK
Nationality is called British
These are the official terms used by Govt
People from N.Ireland are British, and live in UK
1€ 1L of milk
Price varies 0,7-1,3 depending on brand and a shop
10€ A good meal in a bistro (self service) type restaurant
If there's no fish then also plus a peace of cake
Or 2 meals at Mac Donald's.
100€ Diesel fuel for a car full tank
60-70€. Car insurance 30€ for 1-3 moths depending on experience, points etc
I bet you can buy at least a day's worth in Finland, too; more if you're frugal
Lunch buffet implies eating out
At first they were blocky all-caps printed letters, while you learned to actually read
Then it was only cursive
Imo, cursive is so much more faster to write
We learned to write in cursive
That being said, school was the only place where I used that skill
I went to a school with all sorts of European languages, but I attended the French courses, and they taught us cursive as our first way of writing, I write in cursive by default, it’s actually quite hard to write in “printed-like” for me
Cursive, I don't think they ever taught block letters, I learned myself from my mom's writing style
We learnt cursive and then moved to the UK and no one could read my handwriting because they cnt read cursive
I find that in the current year, learning cursive is pointless for most people
Education is one of the very few areas where people still routinely write by hand (and I consider that a waste of time)
Once I graduated college, I haven't written a single full sentence on paper, all I ever did was fill and sign forms
99% of text I write is on a keyboard
I don't like typing on touchscreens, though that'll do in a pinch
>So you never scribble down notes in a meeting
If I had to regularly attend meetings, I'd bring a laptop for that
>or write a shopping list
Most of the time I order groceries online since I hate walking around supermarkets searching for stuff I need
If I need to make a shopping list, I'll write one in google keep when I'm on PC and then look at it from my phone
>or pen a message to your mum
If I need some information relayed by text, I'll send her a whatsapp message
>or put some talking points on a whiteboard
Print letters seem more appropriate for that case
Besides, whiteboards are more useful for drawing diagrams than bullet points
I have always hated writing and reading cursive, and I will avoid it in all cases where there are viable alternatives
I can't think of any instance where cursive is actually better for any useful purpose besides instances where you are forced to write on paper due to some archaic processes that can't be done electronically
I might have had a different opinion if not for the seething hate for cursive I acquired due to being forced to write useless shit in school
This was around 20 years ago, but our Italian tour guide told us to avoid the restaurants that were packed with Japanese and American tourists
Could be
Lots in Latvia as well so I assume places like Rome and Florence must be absolutely flooded with tourists
By the way, that advice brought us down two blocks and to a small family place where the wife/mother cooked and brought us dishes in her slippers
Awesome meal
I find the idea kinda repulsing
Like the long tentacles with the suction cups and their mushy, wobbly heads
ugh no, thanks
But then again I squirm at the idea of most seafood
I do like regular fish but eating stuff like shellfish, octopus/squid etc
for some reason seems disgusting to me
Japanese takoyaki (something like fried dumplings with octopus inside) are the best
Shame that in Latvia it is impossible to find octopus of the same quality
If I was offered a job in the US with high income net of living expenses, I'd be willing to work for 5-10 years and then use the money to retire in Europe
I would not more to US permanently, because there are way too many dealbreakers and annoyances
Well, we call all countries differently in out language, at least with a different pronunciation, but here are some of the most different ones that come to mind
Finland - Somija
United States of America - Amerikas savienotās valstis
Germany - Vācija
Estonia - *cough* Igaunija *cough*
Russia - Krievija
New Zealand - Jaunzēlande
Belarus - Baltkrievija
Croatia - Horvātija
Sweden - Zviedrija
Switzerland - Šveice
Hungary - Ungārija
Germany--Tyskland
WTF
How did Latvia became THAT
Putting flags next to country named : Cool
Putting Latvian flag instead of Austrian flag :
I'm pretty sure that Lituanie is Lithuania and Latvia is Letonie
We've altered it a bit more - it's Somija
That's interesting
Thank you for the info
cough cough because I've always found it weird how we call Estonia Igaunija
I believe we took the name  Igaunija from [Ugannians]
I really don't know either
I've checked this [wiki] which might explain a bit, but it seems that there's an unclear origin
How do you call Latvia in Finnish
It is indeed surprising
I assumed the Russians have their own equivalent of Bureau International des Poids et Mesures, except with all measurements based not on a block of cesium but on a 700ml bottle of vodka
I suppose [Lāčplēsis] slayer) is the national epic that every one knows  and has to read it and is important to Latvian culture
Less availability of a varied amount of things to grow in the cold weather
However, I'd also say there's an East/West divide there too, a great part of that reason being that the Nazis and Soviets tried to stamp a lot of it out and exterminated the arts and culture scene in a lot of areas - cooking included
Latvian: Svētā Romas impērija
Russian: Священная Римская империя
Kārlis Ulmanis here
And then some of us say that we love democracy and dictatorship is shit
Smh
Yup
Climate change denial and belief in homeopathy seem to be the biggest recurring themes, though the "5G gives you cancer" made a big splash a couple months ago
Latvians are pretty superstitious in general so any bs like this has pretty fertile ground to grow in
Antivaxx I haven't heared here but some individuals there will be always
There is one latvian guy who is almost in every comment section science related, talking about flat earth
He also has a lot of content on youtube about it
But I don't think there are more like him
Almost no one denies climat change
But we have a lot of people against 5g internet
There are huge latvian facebook groups about it
Well, WWI enabled us to have foreign relations, and WWII disabled that particular feature for 50 years, so yeah
I'm sure it did, we didn't.
Voice pitch gets higher for some reason
Yes
It's easier to be funny
Our flexible word order and declension/conjugation grammar leaves very little room for language based jokes, e.g. puns, homonyms, unexpected word order, etc
Also, it's easier to put a finer point on things
There's a larger vocabulary in English so you can be more precise with your choice of words
Well, language that has different concepts that your own about very general and common things may change something about the way we express and reflect on our own points (we don't think "in a language", but once we involve speaking into analysis of thoughts), like in this example:  [
Little, but has and depends on personality :) Some people do depend on the feedback and perception of others, so, if such person use more gestures and and other non-verbal things speaking another language, they  may receive another feedback and start reflect on themselves differently
Basically, most national and ethnic traditions/culture are common because they based on the same concepts shared by common language
Think of it as of "national personality" and it's part of every member
Once this member has to replace the first language with another it does affect the way person behaves in its own brain at list
The world is theater and men and women are merely players
We have specific language and behavior codes for home, work, friends, authorities, etc
It may be tiny, but still affects identity and personality
We may even have different concepts about what does make a personality and what shall be considered as a change to it :)  Let's just assume you have independent and stiff personality
You definitely have some stiffness, that's making talking to you a pleasure, btw
Ok, maybe you started talking English in early age and it's feels more natural to you
Or something else
I feel like I'm playing some unexpected guessing game for some reason

[This] guy who had the audacity to perform a song in russian for Latvia
He himself isn't even russian, and the song is not that good
I don't remember which year this was but I'm still mad and fail to see the reasoning behind this decision
Such an embarassment
Yeah but we don't really identify with the russians or the russian language, there's just a lot of "latvian-on-paper" russians due to historical reasons
So I still think it's at least a little bit disrespectful
I have nothing against russians as an ethnic group (russophobia), I just find it a little offensive when russians, born and raised in Latvia, don't speak a word in latvian, act like they own the place and get angry at me for not understanding russian
So sorry, if I'm taking the act discussed above a little personally
At first latvia fought for the Russian empire against the Germans, since the eastern front was pretty much right next to Latvia, so it was a defending the homeland type of thing, but then the Soviets started their revolution, and then Latvia fought for its independence
So now we celebrate the soldiers whose lives were thrown into the meat grinder (by the tsar) that was the eastern front of WW1, and we celebrate the soldiers that defended Latvias newfound independence from Germans and Russians
But I don’t think we use poppies to do that
In Latvian it was already called Čehija, Czechia is no different
So I shouldn't mind it at all
But I do, I can't get myself to day Czechia at all
Same for Latvian
Everyone just says Čehija, not Čehijas Republika
I prefer LSSR flag
looks like the flag of the united baltic duchy
In Latvian envy is skaudība and jealousy - greizsirdība (literally crooked-heartedness)

That’s 26 including English I think
I’m not sure on Belarus or Ukraine, and I don’t know in Estonian, Albanian, Luxembourgish, Turkish or Greek - or a lot of the smaller regional languages
And before anyone wants to get pedantic - I know Finnish, Hungarian, Turkish, and Estonian aren’t “technically” European languages
Included them because of geography
English, Estonian, French, German, Latvian, Lithuanian, Russian, Ukrainian

It's really weird, cuz before elections they were leading un polls, but now they're smallest party supported just by 1%.
Turkey probably
No, we dont have these
But to be fair, most people dont talk or make much noise in their commute anyways
So, there is not really a need for it
Also our trains are quite loud themselves when accelerating and braking
honestly for me (Latvian) the favourite city for me would be Pļaviņas cause it just has such a lovely atmosphere
Riga, but to be more specific, the Pardaugava part of the city
(Riga is geographically separated in two parts by the Daugava river
Hence Pardaugava means “over the Daugava river”)
Cēsis or Kuldīga for me
Some of the most funny memes I have seen in my life were Latvian
The one popular with non natives are the potato memes
Honestly they aren't funny, at least for latvians
We have kind of weird, cursed memes, often very dark humor
But sometimes its low quality, shit joke, bad grammar, etc
(almost r/okbuddyretard shit
But unironical
) We have a lot of "cursed"(mostly bad) boomer humor that is shared on facebook or local social network for boomers -draugiem
I don't think the ingredients are much of a problem, most of them can be found everywhere these days
What really irks me is the measurements - not even ounces and pounds, those can be converted but fucking cups as a measurement
Is it weight, is it volume
Is it the mythical "standard" cup, or just a mug you have laying around somewhere
Over here oyster sauce is widely available in the Asian section in any semi-decent store
For me, it was at 4th grade when we first went to Aiport of Riga (RIX) and after that, we went to  Līvu aquapark in Jurmala forest of the day (4 or 5 hours I reckon)
And after that, we went to McDonald's or some pizza restaurant (I don't remember it well)
The school but the kids probably learn stuff from friends before that
The fact that the closest linguistic relatives to your language are Finns and Estonians is a little more outlandish
> In 1933 Bukh publicly expressed his allegiance to the National Socialist cause and its aim of improving the health of the Aryan race through gymnastics
He really puts the Aryan in yoga
I consider myself to be Latvian who just happened to get Russian as my first language
If my ancestors ended up in a bit different place before the end of WW2, it is possible I'd speak either German or Finnish as my first language, so I don't feel tied to Russia in any way
People there are nice tho, at least the ones I've met
And fantasy books written by Russian authors are so good
It's a shame many of them don't have English translation
On 31 December 1600, the Queen granted a Royal Charter to "George, Earl of Cumberland, and 215 Knights, Aldermen, and Burgesses" under the name, Governor and Company of Merchants of London trading with the East Indies
Later became the Honourable East India Company
Maybe Poland would take it
Not all of these are cities and towns per se but here it goes
Nereta
Akenstaka
Mercendarbe
Raiskums (also others ending with "-ums" such as "Tukums", "Ķegums")
Koknese (Translates to "Wood bearer")
Lielvārde (Translates to "Great name", its historic name: "Rembate")
Kolka (Name derives from Livonian "Kūolka" which means "corner")
Rēzekne (I prefer the sound of Russian: Режица)
Ludza (I prefer the sound of Russian: Люцин)
Ramata
Trikāta
Tiskādi (these 3 have a hard sound to them which sort of encapsulates the essence of Latvian language)
Kūkas (literally: "cakes", however, in a dialect it means "spirits of the bog")
Kaldabruņa (to me this name sounds like the name of an old lady)
Eķengrāve
Ēdole
Vīgante (aka Staburags)
Olaine
Stāmeriena
Jersika
Normally these names are written in English the same way, sometimes the diacritic marks are dropped
This is sometimes anecdotal, as is the case with the town of "Ogre".
Quite popular in New Zealand
And fair interest in Australia
Also smaller countries eg Fiji
not popular here at all
we have to learn basically every sport in school pe but we don't have to learn rugby
i have never met a person who knows how to play it
Yes, milk definetly would go bad faster in warmer conditions, not sure about eggs
Maybe France mainly has UHT milk that has no bacteria that could spoil it in it while unopen
Depends
If one buys fresh milk or non UHT, you have to put it in a fridge and drink fast
I always buy both one fresh and one UHT
Big family
But I refridgarate both, it's conveniet
Everything in one palce
The same for eggs
I can buy washed (expensive) or not washed (cheaper)
I refridgerate both
It's conveniet, everything in one place
QWERTY & ЙЦУКЕН
EN - LV - RU
QWERTY
If you want to type a special character, press ' before typing the normal letter - typing in 'c results in č, for example
if you want a ' then press space after typing it in
In latvia, we have the regular qwerty keyboard, but for letters like ā, š or ļ ect
by pressing either ' or ` before a, s or l ect
All other Romes were run by little girls
Wait 15 languages
Fluently
How does she maintain practice in so many
Well, does she speak Latvian
I mean, idk, depends on situation how I would compliment my girlfriend and nothing springs to mind
I guess "ej tu skaista meitene" is a popular one, meaning "hey you beautiful girl", but it's a line from a really famous Latvian punk song (think Latvia's version of The Clash) so it might be a bit weird if she doesn't know the song, lol
I don't know how to explain it in english  but my city's mayor did some stuff he wasn't supposed to do so like half the politicians are against him
Most of his accounts are blocked and everyone is trying to get him to like step down from mayor but can't because he has good connections
I love this comment
I've never seen anyone consider it "not-healthy", but I've never seen anyone consider it "healthy" either
2 - Struve Geodic arc and old town of Riga
Not much, but  the old town is really something
From Latvia to Lettland, since we were called like that before WW2
And it does sound more westernic not with slavic -ia ending
It's Horvātija in Latvian
Romania sounds like a mania of ro, whatever ro is
Which one
We get really confused with Lithuania which has ia ending either
Yeah, Lettland and Estland, but then people'd get confused
Why do Finns calls Lietuua just like in Latvia expect we call Lietuva
In Latvian too
Exactly the same for my husband
Whenever news hit that Germans are, for example, not so willing to have their vaccine my husband stares at TV in disbelief saying - not the Germans too, they are the most civil country and even they are turning
yeah, the system is very chaotic but i think the most popular surnames end with -iņš -iņa (diminutive) and are weirdly very nature based
Lithuania: We're brothers
Estonia: The kid who came to play with us at the playground and pretends we're still friends
Belarus: It's easy to forget they border us
I have no idea what goes on in there
Russia: The most threatening, but I doubt that they'll do anything to us, because we're in NATO
I apolagise about this, I don't know what our government is thinking
Course we are, it just seems you crush on Finland a bit too much
They claimed they love potatoes more than us, we couldn't just not do anything
(Actually though it was a joke, Latvia and Belaurs; and the people of these 2 nations are very chill with each other)
12-13th century, during the northern crusade
Many wars were fought between the Baltic tribes and the German crusaders, and I think it could be very interesting
Or WW1 when Latvia fought for its independence from first the Russian empire, then the Germans, then the Soviets, and then the remnants of the destroyed German army, all in the span of 2 years
Or WW2 when Latvia was invaded By Soviets, and then Nazis, and then Soviets again, all the while partisan groups fought against both of them, I think if an AC game were to happen then, the assassin would be a forest brother partisan
In Latvia it would be interesting to take place during the singing revolution, 1986 - 1991
It would probably be about fighting against the soviets to make Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia independent again
YES, it's like the advent but instead of lighting a candle each Sunday we watch Home Alone each Friday
Yes has been for many years now
>all 3
There are five
Just wanted to mention the same here haha
I agree, I haven't even watched 4 and 5, still if someone thinks there are 3, there are 5
We have [Urlas]
Also gopniks, and 12 year old gangsters going around with scooters
Some words are the same but mostly i dont understand the other languages
I can understand maybe one in 10 words in Lithuanian
Russians
Pretty common here
A lot of schools before a few years ago taught primarily in Russian, until they passed a law declaring all schools had to be at least 50% in Latvian
It’s pretty common for a few subjects to be taught in English outside of English or American school, and in my fiancées school she even had a few subjects in French also
Plus when I went to school in UK I noticed that the resources for teaching languages are extremely limited because of the tendency to rely on people speaking English
For example, I was taught “wo ist die Bahnhopf bitte
” but not how to understand where the train station is
And I went to a school that taught 5 languages as options, so I can’t imagine how bad it must be in a school that can barely source a French teacher
I’m pretty sure there’s an island in Estonia almost exclusively populated by the Sàmi
Castle and palace both translate to "pils".
The only oned i can think of At the top of my head is “Mēnesis” which means both moon and month, And “bise” which is  supposed to mean shotgun, but I’ve heard people use it to mean rifle
Jauns means both new and young
But they don't really just use "owl" to refer to both animals, each is a different kind of owl, e.g. a horned owl or a wood owl, it's just that there's a single base name for the whole order of animals
In comparison we have not just two but three different base words for owl species - apogs, ūpis un pūce (apogs would be a kind of buho in Spanish
That's in a lot of languages
Same here, Pūce, Ūpis, Apogs; Krauklis un Vārna
The Baltic countries also speak English very well, that is people who are native speakers, not Russians
I think this is mainly due to the reason that there's not much information or entertainment in our own languages, so you have to learn English
This is definitely where I got my English skills from
A friend of mine pronounced queue as "kveevoo".
Ireland
Songs, music, beer, drinking, potatoes, emigration, oppression by a neighboring empire and its yoke thrown off in 1918, and a bloody struggle to do it
There's Ogre, Ape and Madona
We have a town called Ogre
Very unfortunate name for such a beautiful place
Ogre
Just Ogre
[Serious] What is the worst tragedy to happen in your country because of human error or just because someone ignored simple safety rules
Colapse of Maxima supermarket in Riga
It was a tragedy, that happened on 21
November 2013
The roof of the store colapsed killing 54 people
I was in Wales a month ago for a wedding
The bride's father was going to that school, and was ill at the time
An entire generation lost like that is a fucking mess
Especially in Wales, where, from what I've been told, everyone in the valleys know each other
So the entire southern Wales knew someone whose kid died in that
The train crash really pissed me off "Oh we'll be three minutes and few people will be angry
I know
Let's go 160 mph instead of 80
What could possibly go wrong
Isn't this the same fire where that Romanian rock band died
Eh, Hindenburg hardly had a choice from what I understand
Honestly I'll never forget where I was and what was I doing when I first heard the news about it
Goes like this mostly: " so you live in Russia
" Or "Your capital is Vilnus right
Either “what is that
” Or “is that in Russia
Do you speak Russian
Literally always happens
In Latvia 3 times: somewhere in November, then on 1st of December (we had hope that snowy winter have started) and on 2nd of January a little bit
We still have hope, because for the last 10 years winter kinda shifted for 1-2 month for us
Some years February - April were very snowy
Even once or twice we had snow in May
We had like 3 separate days/nights of snow
IT'S NOT ENOUGH, very weird this year
Well i did see some snow but no longer than half a day
At like early November there were a few places with a bit of snow but soon after it vanished
barely, a bit in december and exactly one night this month (and it melted in less than a day)
we had more snow in november than december and january combined
It's been around
Personaly something showing up in TV shop is strong reason to never consider buying it - everything in those ads seems so gimmicky, stupid and overpriced
Hoping for that Olympics bronze medal at midnight
Are we considered
Territory is the same as Ireland, but more than twice as less in population
And that's basically the main advantage and disadvantage in the same time
I really don't know, but I really like how Estonian sound
Our prime minister was born in US, but he is latvian iirc
History teacher said that Prussia existed before 16th century
We call it the star day and it's the last day to get your Christmas tree out of the house
Nothing else is celebrated
Why fireworks were forbidden
Glad that the Irish didn't understand him as well :D
What about that Michiel de Ruyter film
I know it's not current, and it probably doesn't count as a foreign movie about the Netherlands but it seemed somewhat international, production-wise
There is a TV show, though - [Patriot] It's quite good, if you're into that kind of black humor and comedy of errors
Also, I think it was fairly honest about foreign locales, with comedic exaggerations, of course
It does exist
To the best of my knowledge, Welshmen want to eat people's livers with fava beans and Chianti
Oh, and sing about pussycats
Mine, too, and I'm not even any of the nationalities portrayed
Completely agree about Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, one of the rare cases where Hollywood gets it right; The Girl in the Spider's Web (movie) was straight up trash, though
(To be honest, in my opinion, the post-Larsson books are, too, Spider's Web especially, like some shitty Tom Clancy fanfiction set in Sweden
5th and 6th aren't as bad
Well, there’s also a small man in a box
Well I don't know why for many it's viewed as cheap
Look  at other stores
You can definitely buy cheaper furniture in other stores
For sure I can name overpriced stuff
Beds and kitchen systems are way too expensive and doesn't justify prices
IKEA for me is a place where I can go safely with my kids and shop at the same time, and a place where I can get everything for home without running around other 50 stores in my city
Pretty much the same here, except it’s more the go-to for furniture and supplies but not luxury, and we have only one in the country
If Eesti can be of Scandinavia, what abouts Latvias
As long as base is used for NATO operations I'm fine, apart from that I would not want them anywhere near
Awww yis Latvia represent
Nope
And most of "polish groceries" here are called "local groceries".
Poland is like China of Europe when it comes to groceries, as such it's usually branded goods by multinational cooperations or unprocessed agricultural products that are imported from Poland without advertising the fact much (there was a funny video several years ago, where salespeople at market claim everyone has Polish strawberies, except for them)
We don't have Polish cuisine products usually
There's polish sections in tesco evert ere and there's many Polish shops
And Heroes, too
Actually, this is one of rare cases where the audiobook version is preferable - it's Stephen Fry himself reading, and he could read a phonebook and make it engrossing, let alone these books
Mid 1930s, the golden age of latvia before WW2, or 1200, to witness the northern crusades and to see if I can understand any of the languages spoken by the Latvian tribes
Learned Swedish anthem inspired by a Volvo ad starring Zlatan, but the main motivation behind it was to get 10 in my uni class
Also know parts of USSR/Russian anthem due to the fact that it's so catchy
By having more than 2 potatoes
In Latvia it’s the opposite but I grew up in UK where they do it the same as you, so I use them interchangeably without realising it, to the annoyance of everyone else
I use a comma for decimal separators and a space as a thousand separator but I don't know if that's a widespread practice :D
My favourite joke goes like this: (it's not about the current leader tho, haven't heard any about him)
When Vaira Vīķe-Freiberga (first female president) was elected people thought: Ohh, look, a female can be a president too
When Valdis Zatlers (a doctor by profession) was elected people thought: Look, anyone can be a president
When Andris Bērziņš was elected people though: Ohh, we don't even need a president
Or a dog
It's Budapešta in Latvian, so with *sh* (since that's what *š* is) :)
In Latvian it’s ‘Budapešta’. The caron above the ‘s’ makes it an sh sound
Ok so I already know 2 languages fluently so I would definitely want to learn German, Korean and Japanese
German cause I am learning it at school and that would make it way easier for me, Korean cause I like K-pop and want to move to Korea or at least visit Korea at some point in my life and japanese cause I want to move there as well and also cause one of my friends is learning Japanese and I would be able to help him
We removed all USSR monuments as fast as we got our independence
It's all right, wouldn't say it's anything great, in Ventspils
Most of the sidewalks have bike lanes, but they're not really designed around the bike, more put there because there was a sidewalk, so it got widened and a bike lane added
My mum's been getting by on the bike and hasn't been run over by a car yet, so that's good
Really wholesome, until one of my drunk uncles brings up politics
Well, all my grandparents are dead and I don't have any uncles/aunts/cousins/siblings, so family gathering is whenever I visit my mom, I guess
It's pretty chill, we might drink a glass of wine or whip up some cocktail and talk about stuff or watch something together (unless I'm there to help her out with, say, renovations and alike)
(I do have a few not-so-close relatives, but I haven't met them in more than a decade, tbh)
~~Four twenty nineteen~~ Four twenty ten nine
Edit: Sorry, fixed it
Krišjānis Valdemārs (one of the starters and leader for the young Latvian movement (first Latvian awakening) )
Krišjānis Barons (one do the starters for the young Latvian movement and know as "Father of dainas"(Dainu tēvs) organized and systemized pretty much all dainas in Latvia hence the name)
Juris Alunāns ( one of the starters of the young Latvian movement  created the foundation for modern latvian, created new Latvian words and degermanized the language)
Jānis Čakste (first president of Latvia)
Zigfrīds Anna Meierovics (first foreign minister and second prime minister of Latvia)
Kārlis Ulmanis (leader of the provisional government , prime minister and dictator of Latvia and last leader pre ww2)
Now historical figures who aren't Latvian but are still widely known in the nation
Jēkabs Ketlers (duke of Kurzeme and Zemgale established colonies and knew Latvian)
Gabriel Merkel (prominent esto and latvophile wrote the book "latvietis")
For Latvia:
* [Krišjānis Barons]
* [Kārlis Ullmanis]
* [Jānis Pliekšāns ''Rainis'']
* [Jacob Kettler]
* [Jānis Čakste]
* [Aspazija]
* [Albert of Riga]
* [Rūdolfs Blaumanis]
* [Oskars Kalpaks]
* [Krišjānis Valdemārs]
* [Kārlis Skalbe]
* [Peter von Biron]
You need to add a double line break (press Enter twice) for reddit to actually move it to the next line
Reddit's formatting is weird
You could also put a " * " before each name (after a double line break) and it would look like this:
* Item 1
* Item 2
Yea  sorry about that wrote that on my phone, thanks
No, over here they're generally famous for peeing on every public landmark and monument
Nope but they've been known to piss on Monument of Freedom, running around drunk and naked, and starting fights in McDonald's in Latvia
"Oh, it's nothing special," our then finance minister in 2008 about the deepening Great Recession
Such a great country, loved your montains, it's so cheap, it was 50 Euros for a 5 star hotel for 1 night, absolutely astounding, although you did have lots of power lines, like SO MANY
It's also really hot and you have 24/7 stores everywhere
It's amazing
They're illegal in my country
Yes, this, absolutely this
You know, I don't remember it that vividly but I can still relate even if it wasn't that specific spot
A castle built by the Knights of the Livonian Order overlooking the port of Ventspils
My town of Dobele, Latvia has a castle ruins either
Currently it's under construction since they're building museum in it
[This is how it looks now]
[This is how it will look (Last photo)]
It's Āmurs
Might be used as a way describing an idiot
Latvian it's "āmurs" for the normal ones and for the big ones it's "veseris"
Interesting
In Latvian it's "veseris" for a large hammer
Latvian, too
But there is also “veseris,” probably from the same root, which does mean a large hammer
To be fair I think the history teachers are a bit biased, they do teach us to hate Russians in a way
Don't get me wrong, the things they did are unforgivable, we're still recovering as a country, an economy and probably will be for the next 100 years or more
I do get the hate Russians receive
That said, I believe we can co-exist with the right laws in place in our country, like learning Latvian mandatory
My grandma is very nostalgic but she is also not a very bright person, the Soviet era taught her how to survive without anything and how to preserve the food you've got
She likes how she lives, if I was her I would be miserable
Ah, fuck I could write down contents of history book as others have allready tried - if you care to know an entire year is dedicated to 20th century in elementery and then again in high school in a very analytical, matter of fact way - but the truth is that "Soviet" stands for everything that ever could be wrong with the world, even if someone has found memories about some features, they would never want that era to return and if someone actually does they're going to be an outcast in our society
I get your Grandma thing
My mom (in her mid 60's) has a serious hording problem
And most of the stuff she hoards is old Soviet junk nobody will ever use again - old, but never used sheets (that once used to be white, but now are yellowish), old plates, glasses and God knows what else are in those cupboards, that has not seen the daylight in more than a decade
Me and the brothers are always trying to convince her to throw out or give away at least some of that junk
But no - what if someone some day might need it
She somehow doesent get the concept, that it is really easy to get hold of those things nowdays and there is literally no reason to cluter your apartment for "mabey someday".
It's not as cheap and filled with strip clubs and prostitutes as it was 5-10 years ago
There is actually a rest of the country that is worth seeing outside of Rīga
Or Soviet Russia for us
It's not gay if the balls don't touch
First time I heard of a spelling bee was probably on Simpsons or some other kids’ show
In high school I actually participated in one
It was in English, however, because Latvian is a relatively phonetic language
Everyone seemed to have a lot of fun
No such thing needed in Latvia, as every single word in Latvian is pronounced as it's written
We look at comments on the local news sites and the one with the most vile and hateful author is chosen as the de facto brown cardinal who occupies the mind of anyone living here
Even if you disagree with such garbage, you still get influenced by it in every day life
Officially, the 100 nerds assembled from a public popular vote pick a president then vote him in with a 51%. Then the president proposes a prime minister
Then the prime minister has the most de facto power
*It just works*
Kurzeme: Forests everywhere
Latgale: mini Russia in Latvia
Zemgale: do you even exist
Are you sure you're a real region
Vidzeme: 90% of the land is taken by national parks
Riga: First of all stop acting like you're a real region
Two, you're of fucking dicks
Bidet showers
Should be a law mandating those in every toilet
I'm more inclined to answer none
Habits are changing, yes
30 years after USSR i feel like Latvian traditions have become only stronger
For Latvia I would say that "Saule, Pērkons, Daugava" , this song is essentially our unofficial second anthem, some people prefer it to the anthem
Agreed
Was looking whether someone had already posted this
Yeah, but that was direct action from the central government, I'd bet that it's not an action that the federal government of the EU would take
The federalisation itself is not in question right now, this is a discussion that came up from some people's arguments against it
As for independence, what is it exactly
Yes, with the exception of language
Languages strongly influence how we think, and understanding a language is a necessary step to understanding the person speaking it, and are absolutely something worth preserving and studying
I think I love you
Would you care to elaborate
Your region, whichever one it is, has almost certainly been a country at some point
The dukes of France had almost as much independence as sovereign states, with the French king being the "first among equals", until eventually centralising around Paris
What is it I'm supposed to value more
Are we independent now
The existence of UKIP implies a lack of independence within the EU for the UK, and we're even deeper in it
Will the UK be independent after Brexit
True independence is impossible, because it would require a national self sufficiency
Only half of British food is made in the UK, according to [this chart
] Probably that percentage would increase, but not by that much
Is being dependent on other countries for your basic needs independence
u/stevothepedo Ireland does not have the resources for its 5 million people to be self sustaining, not without massive rebuilding of the entire country and losing a lot of the comforts that the people currently experience
The difference between being in a federal EU and a British empire, is that the EU sees you as an equal participant, not an unruly subject with the wrong religion, and is willing to provide aid should it be necessary
As well as having an actual say in what's going on, and the knowledge that you chose to enter the agreement without a foreign army knocking on your front door
I'm saying that independence is a meaningless word on its own
Context is needed
Hong Kong was only given away in 1999
I'm not Serbian, but can relate as my mother language is Russian
Since childhood everyone memorizes keyboard and can type both Latin or Cyrillic letters without looking on keyboard
There is funny glitch, when using keyboard without Cyrillic, suddenly realization of that is coming and you completely forgetting where each letter was
Pretty much allowing USSR take away our freedom in 1940 and doing absolutely nothing about it

As I've been finding out, first aid training when getting a driver's license
I believe it's called threshing barn in English and probaly it was pretty common, except maybe in hotter climates where they might have simply worked outside, it's just forgoten, because not all have special word for it and interest in historical heritage
Oh man o remember going mushroom picking with my grandmother and then making mushroom stew and sauce
What the hell is wrong with you
In Latvian, it's called "rija".
Come visit
You might be surprised
Different sorts of rye and wheat breads, as well some weirder stuff like oat bread
Though we maek our "sour bread" with honey and call it sweet-sour bread
> not fried here, it’s raw
Right
I'm out
Haven't seen anything like that, but Foogling it brings up some results
Fiskars mostly sells Garden tools here, though, I'd expect to buy them at construction and/or gardening supply store, not pharmacy
Not these exact scissors but most of my gardening tools are made by Fiskars
It has always been considered a staple of quality here
Here I've seen only kitchen scissors (my family has them) and special ones for gardening
I have exact same one, but in white colour
I just guess franca would really be lingua franca then
The Freedom Monument for sure is the symbol of Latvija
If a monument doesn’t count and it has to be a building, then probably the National Library is the only other really famous building we have, or Riga Central Market
Most people who come here would remember the Freedom Monument first though
As a foreigner who last visited Vienna 6 years ago, and other Austrian cities even longer ago than that, I would say the Hofburg or Karlskirche were the two buildings I associate most with Austria
I personally ride a road bike, I like that the bike is narrow, light (great for putting it on your shoulder when you need to climb stairs) and, most importantly, I think I look cool riding it
Unlike in Denmark or the Netherlands, bikes here are very varied, some people ride classic city bikes, some old and new road bikes or tourism bikes but quite a lot of people choose to ride a mountain bike, maybe due to our horrible roads
In Riga only daredevils ride on the road, or sometimes you just don't have another option, so we don't weave traffic and if you do you're seen as an asshole lawbreaker because cyclists are supposed to ride close to the edge of the road (with some exceptions)
Overall people ride on sidewalks, which is actually illegal, but as a cyclist I can say that most people are just too scared to ride on the road
Sadly, cyclist culture is not very developed here and somewhat looked down on, people see cyclists as annoying, the infrastructure is bad and not thought through
Really hope things will change because I think its a great way to move around and would fix many problems
Twice for Latvia:
1918-1040 - Independence from Russia after WW1
1991- now - The Soviet Union collapsing
I still have that image of Paris in my mind and I’m not going to Paris to keep it that way
True, as usual with the French, the liaison is hard to prevent
They must have mixed you up with Switzerland
We have the state police doing all the serious stuff everywhere + road traffic policing; and then in the cities there's municipal police taking care of drunks, minor hooligans, parking, stuff like that
There is a military police but it only handles matters internal to the military
We take it bit by bit
We have to learn Latvian and World history till 9th grade and then we repeat everything and go more in depth in high school
Came here to write exactly this
Not disappointed someone beat me to it
Let's also not forget that most countries only learn their own history as a nation state, and possibly in Europe medieval states as well
Nowhere in the world does any great depth of history in high school
Kids are too young and curriculums are too limited
Goddamit, turns out my Persian cat is actually Russian
Austria has this weird rule where a vignette purchased online can be valid only after 18 days (based on the EU rule that online purchases can be cancelled within 14 day period)
Why not use the digital purchase exceptions where a product/service can be provided during the cancellation period if the user is informed and agrees to opt-out of the 14 day cancellation period
I think he refers to safety requirements on the roads regarding using lights in the daytime
I doubt it's written down in any regulations, more like if you are polite towards the police officer, they're likely to let you off with a warning, in part maybe that it's more of a hassle writing up a ~~foreigner~~ fellow EU citizen for something trivial
Schuko does have grounding, it's the Europlug that has only two wires
You might be thinking of the fuse in the plug that Euro plugs don't have because of the breaker box
Do pīrāgi count
I guess the etymology is simile to pierogi but we bake them and they’re usually made with speck, onions, and lardons
I guess we also have pelmeņi, which are technically Russian, but we have our own variations which are, honestly, as good if not better than any пельмени I’ve had in Russia
It's a different kind of cheesecake, made with cottage cheese, drier and more crumbly
A good one is good on its own but in a bad one the raisins actually help to break up the texture and make it less dry
EU issued passports work of make sense only when EU is more federalised
That being said, I would prefer one system of issue for all member states
Galva, pleci, ceļi, pēdas, ceļi, pēdas 2x
Acis, ausis, mute, deguntiņš.
Galva, pleci, ceļi, pēdas, ceļi, pēdas
We basically substitute toes to feet
The rest is the same
I don't know really
can any Latvians help
For a bit there I wasn't really sure if you meant Mussolini or Berlusconi
Honestly, I'm still not completely sure
It's amazing how even Turks hate him and yet sadly there's nothing you can do about it
Probably Ivars Godmanis or Ainars Šlesers
The former was PM of the only parliament that has been dismissed by the President, and the latter's crimes and the parliaments refusal to permit a search of his property were the reason for said dismissal
Geez I remember watch the speech on TV where he dismissed the parliament and sitting in stun silence for good two minutes after it ended
Want to vote and have an impact

It was like living on planned economics and common being over personal, if you're from a city or a town you were born most likely in maternity unit, went to nearest childrengarden, then in school, in USSR 2nd graders would be organized into Octobrist organization, from like fifth you'd be taken to Pioneers Youth organization with some ideological rituals, about 8th-10th grade you'd be proposed to enter Komsomol organization, which had specific requirements for your morals and deeds
If you had shown yourself as reliable comrade you'd be proposed to enter to the Communist party
For others it could be a specialization college or an Institute / University after which you'd be proposed with a job position sometimes even in another part of USSR
There was no unemployed people, moreover if you were caught in a working day on the street doing nothing  - you'd be checked for skipping the duties
After several skips you might get administrative due - money fine or public works
For kids it was fun at some point - we never knew anything different, toys, cartoons were the same for everyone from Baltics to China borders, parents were always employed, health care and education was for free, that is if we talk about 60s and beyond
I remember a story my uncle told me about how he sneaked all kinds of illegal items into USSR (Coke, Pepsi, Snickers, Twix) and risked the safety of this entire family because you could actually go to jail at that time if police found those items in your house
Or, if they actually did something, once faced with Western technology, standards and requirements, suddenly realized how useless all of their education or experience is
We had ketchup, but after like 1986
Before that we had tomato paste
Yeah, everybody had a shit job, shit housing, shit food and a small amount of useless money
Of course Mao was a big friend first, but later USSR slowly drifted from him, especially after demolishing personal cult of Stalin by Khrushchev in 60s.
Atrocities and death toll due to famine in China and near regions were huge and there were gossips in USSR about it, but that wasn't a topic for a small talk with friends
Such things usually were discussed whispering somewhere far from anyone and anything
Plus there were no reliable information sources, just some occasional radiotransmissions from the West and rare cases of individual contacts with Chinese who would want to share anything about it
Official position was "Unbreakable Chinese brothers are bravely fighting against exploitators and all types of degradation of humanity for our common enlighten future in Communism".
There were aspects that were maybe even good - much lower inequality, free education and healthcare, jobs for everyone - at the much too high cost of everything else
A large reason for low inequality was that no one had shit, education and healthcare was free and available to anyone, and also equally bad for anyone, and the economy was ultimately unsustainable
It was the same ideological system, while being Octobrist I was chosen as a head of our "star" (group of 5 kids, allusion to 5-pointed soviet red star - I tell you it was just like a sect from your day 1) and my duty was to organize our group to collect, store and pass money for the starving kids in African countries
We were writing letters to youngsters in another ideological-friendly countries (never had a chance to write to GDR, though) and even receiving replies
A bunch of activities and even more after becoming the pioneer: activity groups of any kind - sports, nature patrol, helping workers and farmers, building radio out of a pencil, wire and a couple of transistors, granade throwing, hikes to god knows where
I also was a school newspaper guy at some point, but for a couple of months only
Jesus, it was crazy
> it wasn't any kind of Stalinist oppression
Because it wasn't. When people think about communism, they think the USSR or Warsaw Pact, and compared to that, Yugoslavia was a paradise
That part of older generation that looks back on it fondly do it because that's when they were young and everything is better when you're young
Sometimes, it just a habit now
It was a must-have skill for [LRD]
There are lots, but my favourite is:"Sit dirsu pret zemi
" It basically means hit your ass against the ground and is said in situations when a person doesnt want to eat or wear something
For example
Person 1:"Here i made you an omelette". Person 2: "I dont want it
" Person 1: "Tad sit dirsu pret zemi
Haha that's dope

Riga
The city center is completely safe
The large commie block outskirts might be a different story, but the most you'd risk there would be a mugging
Yes, the trejdeksnis, as portrayed in the comedy TV series Community episode "Conspiracy Theories and Interior Design":
According to wikipedia, that appearance is also about its only claim to international fame:
"Ass" which means "sharp"
"Nazis" which means "knife"
so a "sharp knife" is "ass nazis"
There one that comes to mind
Just means feel
Glāze : cup
Ass in Latvian means sharp or axis
Hate
I love'em
Here in Latvia you could get a luxury apartment the size of a regular house in an exclusive living area, a nice ~250-400 square meters house in a fancy area, or a semi run down ~900 m2 house in an average/shabbier area
You could get a building roughly 400 m2 in size in the very center of the town
You can probably buy the whole town with that kind of money where I'm from
Ofc those 900m2 houses are, for the most part, without any furniture, technologies, other furnishings, there's often no running water or electricity, the walls or floors may be caving in in some rooms etc
So yeah, they're basically like those abandoned houses people would go to explore, and it would probably cost 3x as much to make it livable (and most likely already was/would be turned into an apartment building)
In Latvian the ladybug is usually called bizbizmārīte, which could be literally translated as 'buzz buzz little Mary
The latter two
The first floor is the street level one or slightly raised
Gender reassignment surgery
Latvia and dark bluejeans
Jeans and ,not sure if this counts, the Christmas tree
The guy who invented jeans moved to America and invented them with the help of some American dude
Jeans and the Christmas tree
Well, not in Latvia, but Latvian-born immigrant Jacob Davis invented jeans and then partnered with Levi Strauss to mass produce them
But that was already in America
Does it count
Jeans and citric-acid
also JEANS
One of the biggest rivers in Latvia is called "Lielupe" - big River
It flows into the sea next to a city called "Jūrmala" - seaside
Don't forget Newport
Wait, actually, do forget Newport
I would also add some places that have jaun- (new) added to the names
For example there is Mārupe and Jaunmārupe
Jaunpils is the weirdest of those for me
I have a few friends around South Wales, mostly Merthyr
They all say Newport should be avoided like the plague
in resturants yes
at home no because we don't have any
Knowing how crazy pizza gets in France, Sweden and even Italy, we have very traditional pizza with nothing special added and no dipping sauces
I'm guessing Iceland
That con is why I love Germany
No need to waste time beating around the bush, when you could just be direct
If you think they're assholes you're weak, they're simply efficient
Blackout curtains
Even IKEA has a wide selection
I know
Just like Germans
I like it
It's efficient
It's better
There's nothing bad about it
Yes, I know quite well what it's like, we're on the same latitude as South of Sweden
To be honest, as a late riser, I quite like it but I see why some might not
Not having those dark winters would be even better, though
Yeah, I also really like the Russian anthem musically
It’s not something Latvians would shout about though, for obvious reasons
Geopathology and dowsing is a big thing here
Like I've seen even supposedly rational people back that shit
Something like ley lines but that there's water in them and that it radiates some mystical energy that is bad; but ordinary streams of water and plumbing don't, and you really shouldn't sleep on top of it
Also, just about the most dangerous thing you can do is supposed to be sitting in a draft (as in wind) indoors
Actual wind outside, nah, fine; stuffy air, CO and CO2 poisoning inside, also fine but god forbid there's air moving inside, you can get all kinds of ailments from it
Whistling indoors is bad luck
Always make the sign of the cross when you pass a church (mostly only old ladies believe this one)
If you go to sleep before dawn on the summer solstice you’ll have a year of bad luck
If you are unmarried and sit on the corner of the table you are not going to get married for the next 7 years
We have the first two as well
> Looking at your cards before your entire hand has been dealt when playing 25
That sounds more like a game rule than a superstition
We have this thing (but I think many do) that you don't gift knives or other sharp things, period
If you want to give a knife to someone, they pay you, even if it's just a single cent
wow you guys have draft, too
I always thought it was our own special brand of stupid
I didn't use any folders and nothing was colour-coded
This thread has been very confusing and/or enlightening
I graduated in 2001, and I just used regular notebooks of varying thickness, one for each subject
We also had these very thin notebooks for homework
Granted, that was some 20 years ago, so some things might have changed (probably less notebooks and homework being done via internet and all that), but I still haven't heard anything about things being colour-coded
We'll talk again in June
I don't see how it's an issue with capitalism
When there's a shortage of housing, capitalists solve the problem by building more and selling it for profit
If they can't build more, it means there's someone preventing them from doing it
I think you need to float your island farther south then
Otherwise, you're missing out on the joy of having only 3 hours of daylight/darkness
Rent seeking happens under every economic system
The government's job is to minimize it
If it allows it to happen or is complicit in it, that's a failure of a specific government, not the economic system
I personally think that zoning laws are fundamentally a bad idea and have caused way more problems than they prevented
>Any economic system that eschews private property makes rent-seeking impossible by definition
You can have an economic system that eschews private property and still have a government awarding unearned resources to some people
>This power distribution, and the way it is supported, is what defines capitalism
When you define things like this, you can say that starvation defines socialism

Software developer communities are generally not localized
We all learn in english, share code and knowledge with documentation, tutorials, books
Why would anyone ever limit the future of a software project to only an arbitrary subset of the global talent pool
There is no good reason
Even for a small personal project, you never know when it could grow into something more that you share on GitHub
Maybe it's different in some countries (Germany comes to mind)
I've been working in international companies all my life, and my friend groups have also been international
No idea because there STILL isnt one here
At least they are working on it
Yeah, of course
Bit it depends on age, I guess
I'm 19M and I had a lot of female friends and my bff is female
I just realised that I have more female friends than male
founded on the 18th of November, 1918 :)
101 years old
Or 819 years old if you count the creations of the Livonian order (an order of crusaders) who were the first form of government in the territory
happy independence day
I wouldn’t say so, they were a government composed of the German aristocratic ruling class, ruling over the Latvian and Estonian peasantry
The Livonian order was however, the earliest known organized government in Latvia, especially after it collapsed and gave way to the Duchy of Kurland, which was still unfortunately dominated by a German ruling class
Exact same situation here, too
Similar idea here
To me Sydney “felt” a lot like California (so did Vladivostok in Russia for that matter, another big Pacific city)
New Zealand, on the other hand, felt very British
The rural countryside had a lot of similarities, and the cities felt a lot like large English towns or small cities
It surprised me how much central Wellington resembled Birmingham or Manchester
There was absolutely nothing of the sort
Only for girls through 5th to 7th grade
Boys kad to learn woodcutting and carpentry instead
Yes, it was a minor feature in housekeeping class, a subject I really hated
It was only well after finishing school that I learned that at least now you apparently can learn more fun stuff with boys instead, if you push for it, apparently it now vounts as single subject with 'textile' or 'woodworking' group choice, instead of being stright up sexist
Nah man, cooking is so rare that it inly happens 1/2 a year

Not sure how should I answer it since I don't know the official language of the country I was born in and a citizen of
I don't care I guess
I think it's already a requirement for citizenship by naturalization
I didn't study art, however, studies  involved other kinds of projects that could be copyrighted and we were asked to sign copyrights over for work done during the studies
They did provide the equipment and software needed, plus for most part we had group works anyway

Russian is a Slavic language, is it not
Well I suppose if you meant as in the name isnt common in all Slavic languages, then I misunderstood you, I apologize
Brooklyn Nine-Nine has an episode named "Captain Latvia" where one of the characters and Boyle speak Latvian for a bit, though I cannot understand most of what they are saying
Potatoes and Russians aren't everywhere you see here
Before WW2, our army’s main insignia was the swastika (represented thunder or power in Latvian mythology) so when the Soviets occupied Latvia, they mistook our planes for German planes, and so there was a lot of friendly fire at the beginning, until the swastikas were painted over
After that, during operation Barbarossa
No, before WW2, the latvian army was very barebones, purely defensive, and what i meant was, when latvia was invaded, and later attacked by the germans, the small amount of planes we had, were called into battle, but some of them experienced friendly fire, due to their insignia being similar to german insignia
It's not my recent discovery but from times I was a teenager
Turned out Novuss, very popular game in Latvia is in fact Latvian-Estonian invention (similar games known in some other Nothern European countries though) and hardly ever heard anywhere else
It's not crazy popular (I blame the bland kindergarten/school lunches) but it's quite common here
Well in Latvia we do eat buckwheat, so atleast one third of Balts is covered
Really
Novuss is Latvian-Estonian invention
No wonder it is so popular here
We even have a table in our university
A sandwich
Only the Dutch have sandwiches
It's invention / interpretation, lots of games have square table and pockets on the corners
But this exact variant was shaped in Estonia and Latvia
In Latvia it became huge
In the 80's, you could see a novuss table in every yard during summer
Boys from the same neighborhood usually was saving many together to buy one table for themselves
Those who had personal - were everybody's friend
Boric acid easily available and cheap in any pharmacy in that time was used to polish the table
But in mid-end of 90's it was banned or something and seems like it affected the popularity of the game
It's really sucks to play unpolished table, but substitutes for the acid were kinda lame and really hard to find at least for a few years
Oh, certainly, no arguing that
It's just that a fair bit of people I know hate it because of past experience
When you cook it properly at home, it's actually quite good
But, to be honest, not something I would want to eat *every* day
From some googling it doesn't seem so but even then, open face sandwiches are not that unique
It's the default mode of sandwich where I live, for example
Seeing some of my coworkers' lunches and the state of the prepackaged sandwich shelves in shops, I beg to disagree
I mean, sure, it's not the only or even the absolute majority of lunches but still
Used to some 10 years ago, but I don't think we do anymore
We have mulled wine (Gluhwein) though
Some conquerors are better than others, though
We still remember the Swedes fondly, compared to the Germans, Poles, and Russians
Players of Sid Meiers's Civilization series - rise to the occasion
I would argue that it is Tatjana Ždanoka, co-chairwoman of the Latvian Russian Union party
This woman does whatever she can to promote a "let's fight for the good old days" rhetoric among the Russian-speaking populace in Latvia
She does not encourage the integration of minorities within Latvian society, but rather a conquest for "Russian rights" - Russian language as a state language, state funding for education entirely in Russian, and whatever else can be thought of
Every time there is some sort of agitation or claim about "discrimination against Russians in Latvia", this demon of a woman is at the forefront of it all
She has compared Latvia to Nazi Germany in international press in an attempt to gain support
All the while, she is known to make regular trips to Moscow, which often includes meeting Mr
Putin himself
Worst of all, she represents Latvia in the European Parliament
She is essentially a Russian agent making decisions for the European Union, and we're just letting that happen to us
TLDR: Pro-Russian woman that denounces Latvia as a fascist state
Represents Latvia in the European Parliament
It's either Artuss Kaimiņš or Aldis Gobzems
Artuss Kaimiņš - he's hipocritical and has a very high ego
When corona just started in Latvia, he got sick but continued going to work, although he had symptoms and lied to doctors about meeting someone infected and being abroad
He has also gotten in bar fights and is very disrespectful
Aldis Gobzems - terrorises other politicians during work and posts everything on his tik tok
He also tells young people to fuck off and read a book for once
Also was once caught eating his boogers
Both are dicks and think that they can get their message through by terrorising others and posting it on social media
Yes I love them
> Beautiful (but very demanding) girls
It's funny how the more conservative a region is, the more they tout their women's virtues as a point of pride for the whole country
Almost as if women were property, like a prize pig
(Don't get mad, there are people over here that do that, too
I don't like potatoes
Like I love potato pancakes and mashed potatoes but I just can't stand boiled potatoes, fried potatoes (expect deep fried) and I especially hate potato salad and potato soup
From what I’ve gleaned so far, I strongly suspect no one really likes ouzo very much, they’ve just been keeping up appearances as a point of national pride, and hoping for someone to finally come out and say it
*Calling the Italian mob*

It's completely opposite for me
Well, we have a saying "tā nav ķīniešu ābece". It's used when someone dosn't understand something simple
It translates to "it's not the chinese alphabet
Same here
If you've been introduced, it's very weird to address one another with Mr
/Mrs
Lastname
I could see it happening maybe with strangers or with extreme disparity in social hierarchy but other than that such formal address would seem more like mocking than respect
Exactly the same here

Reporting in with a complaint about Latvijas Pasts, I've got a package stuck indefinitely at the local post office
I ordered it before any emergency measures, Pasts announced closure of all post offices before I managed to pick it up
Luckily it's nothing urgent, I just hope that they would reopen at all
Pretty rare, but noticable, because people with two names usually insist on using them
I think legally you can give your child up to three names
Tips seem a bit odd for me
Albert Heijn in the Netherlands used to sell/give away a special key chain with an AH coin that fits in their carts
The key chain had a carabiner (or what's it called) to unclip the coin from the rest of the key chain
That was pretty cool since I random carried actual euro coins around
They're heavy and puff-up your wallet so much
Hell yeah, federation all the way
Oh god, I remember now
When I was in school around 02-03, cockroaches were a regular occurrence, but I've not encountered one in the last 10 years
Oh, I remember how much of them we had
My family had big cd/casette music player and there was a place for big 6 x 9V batteries (we used wire to play music) and once I opened the cover
And about 10 of big red/orange cockroaches came out of there
Brr
Anyway, I say one at my new place 2 years ago
So they still exist somewhere
i legit don't think i've ever seen a cockroach
EDIT: I live in Latvia, not UK, now
In Latvia, the public transport system relies on these people that I call the "Ticket gestapo".
Rather than paying the bus driver, you can just hop on the bus here with no walking past the driver, or anything
You're meant to buy a card somewhere in the city, top it up, and scan it when you enter the bus
But most pedestrians just hop on for a stop or two and jump off
The weird way that Riga city has handled this, is to employ officers with scanner guns to come onto the bus randomly and check if you've scanned your pass, which is impossible to buy on the bus itself
If you haven't scanned, you get 30eur fine on the spot
I think to actually to that job you have to be a sociopath
It's such a backwards way of charging for public transport
My morning coffee usually helps me relieve any blockade I'm facing
I don't eat potatoes

Don't talk shit about Lithuania and Estonia
Only we are allowed to joke about them
Poles are the only exception
What legal that should be illegal
I heard that advertising towards kids was illegal in Sweden and Finland
You're right, we should just ban all vices that I don't like, that worked out so well every time it's happened before
Better yet, we should just tax the fuck out of them so that all vices are just for the rich and powerful
After all, the rest of us are just here to work for them and make them money
Yes, that's indeed, normal
The European ones have normal sugar, not HFCS
Other things could also impact perception of sweetness like lower acid level or whatever
TIL we don’t have a binge drinking culture
We have them here as well, though it's hard to be "in the middle of nowhere" in Latvia, so they're mostly near some nature trail or nature park
ngl the potato jokes are getting a "bit" old at this point
We have 6 toes
Potatoes
The stereotype where we get compared to Slavic drunks
Our Baltic neighbours call us ice-cream bc we love it so much and Lithuanians believe that we have 6 toes
Knife wielding drunks
My best friend is Finnish and I've yet to hear that one
I thought you all just sat silently brooding in the sauna, listening to heavy metal and chainsmoking
Mostly just the introduction of the Euro
Difficult to go pro-East when the East is waging a war
Not OP but we also joined the Eurozone ~~at the same time~~ a year earlier
The Latvian lat was more expensive than the Euro, so everything seemed more expensive at the start, and people, including myself, were confused about the costs of a few things
Helped that at the start, for like a year, the prices of everything were written in both the Euro and the Lat
Eventually, you just get used to it, and when you go to other countries, you realise how nice it is to not have to bother with exchanging currency
We introduced the euro a year earlier
I remember driving through Lithuania in 2014 and they still had Litas
My bad, I assumed they were also 2014
Duh
Everyone knows that Latvia is the only legitimate successor of Roman Empire
Technically, we also didn't become communist
The interwar Republic of Latvia had a government in exile and the current republic is considered a direct continuation of the prewar state
The Latvian SSR was a different country established in 1945 and ended in 1991

What stupid games did you play when you were kids
Some examples from my childhood:
knuckles - one kid would put his fist on a table and another would flick a coin along the table at their knuckles
They would take turns flicking the coin until one gave up
We did this in 3rd and 4th grade until a rumor that someone got AIDS this way scared us off
palm slap - two kids would hold out their hands palm down
One kids hands would be over the others
Then the one whose hands are on the bottom would try to slap the top of the other kids hands before they can react
Again taking turns until one gives up
A more hardcore version was holding your hands in fists and rapping the knuckles
break the line - we'd split up in two groups, line up against each other holding hands, and then one kid from each team would run at the other line and try to break through the held hands
Often resulted in clotheslining, especially for shorter kids
shoulders - take turns punching each other in the shoulder until one gives up
What about “blackout”? Someone does couple of squats and then someone else takes a scarf or a jacket sleeve and applies moderate pressure to their neck area untill they pass out
We played this under the names kazaki-razboiņiki (cossaks and criminals) or indians and cowboys
>not really games but we sniffed bolero (soda powder) and huffed technocol rapid (instant glue) in school
Is that the origin of your username
We'd put a kid between two matresses and walk over him, called it the massage
We started off with this one, but it quickly devolved in to a pain tolerance contest
We played this too, when it was only boys the penalty for missing a catch was a kick in the ass
You mean put salt on your skin and rub it with an ice cube
Sounds like a good way to get cold burns
>Nobody ever won, we got bored and stopped after a few weeks when we realised hurting each other is dumb
Did you go to a school for gifted children
That reminded me - we played "the corpse", where you float face down for as long as possible, "the axe", where you try to sink to the bottom of the sea and stay as long as possible (we'd do this in shallow water), and "the moonrise", where you dive, do a somersault underwater while pulling down your pants, and then surface naked ass-first
We also did the sticker slapping game, but mostly used the wrappers from the ["Love is" chewing gum]
Austrija- Ungārija or Austrijas-Ungārijas impērija or Austroungāru impērija
So basically same just with little changes that comes with the language
Austroungārijas impērija
Can you explain why it is like that
I mean you have a healthy country with good income and everything seems to be fine
Vāvere
Pronounced the way it's written, the "ā" is like "a" in "water" but longer
Vāvere
I don't think it would be that hard for non-native speakers
Vāvere
Vaaverae
The language is Latvian
As for the origin, not sure - perhaps it has something to do with the latin word "viverra", meaning "ferret".
Fridge
I don't think I've ever seen anyone I know not keeping them in the fridge
Maybe unless the person has no fridge and eats the eggs straight away
Who the fuck doesn't store them in the fridge
Brits are officially metric, have been for quite a while now
I had a tricycle and later a bicycle with a helper wheels as a kid, but I never learned how to ride it without the helper wheels
Eventually I outgrew that bike and for obvious reasons didn't get a new one (there wasn't really any need for me to have a bicycle anyway), so at least as a kid and teen I never learned
I finally did learn in my early thirties, but I pretty much never use it anyway
No real need for it, I prefer to go for a walk
Learnt to ride at the of 5ish on a Soviet bike that had the frontal brakes on the right side of the handlebar
Did a couple of carthwheels while braking before my father loosened the tension wires
Did a couple of carthwheels when I got my first MTB, due to that one having the frontal brakes on the left side and the rear brakes on the right side
Got myself deep into mountain biking at around 15 and almost broke a couple of bones before getting older/smarter and moving on to other, safer activities, like drinking and going clubbing
Started biking again seriously after I moved to the Netherlands, nearly 10 years later
I don't really know anyone that can't at least keep their balance on a bike while on a straight road, though some of my (foreign) study mates came close
I learnt it only at 20 y. o. and I'm very proud of it
Next thing to learn — now to swim
I kinda can do it, but for the little distance/time, because I have a fear of a depth
No, I really wanted a bicycle as a kid, because my cousin had one (but wouldn't let me ride)
When I was in teens and had allready lost interest I won a bicycle in lottery, learned to ride somewhat, but didn't keep doing it since I thought it was illegal to ride it without licence after 12 and I didn't feel I was good enough to pass any test
I decided to try again last year and I can't
A game set in ancient Livonia where the protagonist is the chief of a Baltic tribe fighting off crusading invaders
In movie form, that was what the crazy never made sequel to Gladiator was intended to be
We have brāļukas for lithuanians, and lithuanians have braliukai for us
Both are diminutive for brothers
Lithuanians as brāļi, literally brothers, because of the shared history, similar cultures and languages, etc
I guess Estonians would be the weird brothers too haha
Not the Welsh though
Leek-eating sheep shaggers
That's interesting, didn't know it, thanks
Jums arī!
I was studying during USSR falling apart, so it was very interesting mix of views :) But mainly we studied prerequisites, invasion to Poland and whole Eastern front in details
Allies and their actions were only high-level touched in school programs, most of attention out of Eastern front was given to partisan wars on occupied territories and concentration camps
Japan actions also were usually mentioned just briefly
Yours, actually
Period under Swedish Empire were concidered better than most foreign empires that ruled here, but serfdom was never abolished in territories of Latvia
They're everywhere here
Latgaliešu (Latgalian)
I don't know the language as it's not an official one, but I live in Latgale
It's sounds like a mix between old Latvian and Russian
Some people in my family, as well as some of my classmates speak it very well
Kurzeme (Kurland) also has their own dialect, which is pretty cool
Latgalian
Some people call it a dialect but it's a lot too different for that
Regular Latvians from outside of Latgale region understand it only a little better than Lithuanian
Also Livonian, which is related to Estonian and Finnish
The last native speaker died a while back but there have been efforts to revive it recently
I think around 100 people maybe speak it to a reasonable degree
I think the concensus about Letigallian is that it's also just a dialect of Latvian, rather than it's own language
In Courland, we do also have our own dialect, but again, still Latvian
The only thing from the dialect of Letigallia that I've heard is a song, "Vysskaistuokajai meitiņai". Spelling might not be right
Also Scots
A language that split off from Middle English and is pretty similar to English, but still distinct
Yeah, I know, it's sad
Must've been a pretty cool language tho
Well, my dad spoke to a few linguists, and they've said that Latgalian is a language, where as Kurdish (Kurzeme) is still a dialect
I'm not really passionate about either region, I'm just repeating what linguists have told me
Well there's also [this song] it's become a bit of a meme
I also don't know the spelling, but the meaning of the title is sweet
You're probably right then, I vaguely remember it from, I think, my Latvian teacher who's a linguist and from that neck of the woods
Kurdish is not something used for Kur/Courland, Kurdish is an Iranic language spoken by the Kurds in Turkey/Syria/Iran
Courland/Couronian is what I use that causes no confusion
Yeah, linguists probably know what constitutes as a language better than use haha
I've just remembered that Kurdish really is a middle east language, not one spoken in Kurzeme
I had forgotten that, thanks for reminding me, seriously
I'll now remember to call Kurzeme's dialect Couronian
Yeah, also the song's pretty sweet
I don't have a license and walk to work
Public transport gets me to any part of the city in less than an hour, but I rarely need it
The Balkans are first of all a peninsula, so the border ought to be between the extreme northern points of the Adriatic Sea and the Black Sea forming a line roughly between Odesa in Ukraine and Trieste in Italy
In Latvia, there is still a good chance to stumble to something
From as recent period of WW2 to pre crusades
It is still possible to stumble in forests to remains of wartime equipment and in same forest to stumble on rock formation predating crusades (my ex-wife found some German and soviet helmets half buried right next to rock pile from much older times), rarer is to find money deposits
I grew up in country side which used to belong to some German baron, but later land was split between Latvian freedom fighters
As a kid I found deposit of Latvian interwar coins buried near the tree and polish-lithaunian coin from 1666 while digging in vegetable harden
In my city there is free public transport for those who live here
It started as free transport for schoolchildren and seniors, and now it is free for everyone
We have those contactless "Jurmala resident card" which you need to swipe on terminal in the bus
When I need to go to another city you can use train or intercity bus
For both of them you can buy tickets in mobile apps and then show them from phone screen
Of course you can buy it in old-fashioned way too
Intercity buses generally have contactless payment terminals, so you can just pay with your card or phone with NFC when you are getting in the bus
In Riga (capital city) we have contacless RFID tickets called e-talons
Even for 1 ride you need to buy e-talons
You can buy paper ticket from driver, I believe, but I've never seen someone doing it
You can buy them in in small shops (kiosks) called Narvesen or in some big shops info centres
You buy them, get on the bus (or something else), touch terminal with it and voila -  your ride is registered
Terminal will show how many rides are left on your e-talons
If you need to use Riga public transport more often, then you can get personalised e-talons
This thing can be refilled, and you can load more advanced tickets to it, for example, month ticket
There are terminals where you can refill them (but I'm not sure if you can buy one-time tickets in them)
One ride cost is 1
15 euro, but I'm a student, and my personalised e-talons have student discount so I can buy rides for 0
27 euro
In Riga we have RFID chip card of three kinds - single use yellow that is preloaded with a number of tickets and blue with or without id that you can load tickets on
Besides one-ride tickets, you can also buy tickets for a period of time for different types of transportation
You can also purchase paper ticket for one ride from the driver (and IIRC at places where you'd normally buy or load cards as well)
Other cities have different public transportation systems, for example, I recsntly heard Ventspils relies on minibuses that have different price on each route
Some smaller towns likely don't have their own systems and people use intercity transport, which probably still has paper tickets that you buy beforehand or from the driver
In Rīga there’s an electronic card for all public transports-‘E-Talons’.In my city Rēzekne there’s so called ‘Rēzeknieša karte’which is basically the same thing
Both cards are given only to registered residents of the city,thou in Riga you can buy a small amount of these cards,even if you are not a resident of the city
You can also pay in cash,if you want
We are building a new solar collector array to provide hot water (and/ or central heating) for at least part of our town Salaspils
Is sad reality in Latvia
For real, it's eaten almost every day, but we've got alternatives
I've been enjoying buckwheat lately
It's hard to compete with the potato though
Thank friend
Is sad stori
For Latvia, it would be Ice Hockey, and actually, Latvia and Finland are the only countries in Europe where Hockey is more popular than football
Every May annually Latvia goes crazy about our hockey team and the IIHF world championship
Probably get our food and go the living room to play video games with Lithuania, Estonia and anyone else who'd join us
Meanwhile Estonia is trying to crash your party and we're constantly dragging him away so he don't embarrass himself even more
Not unless Gordon Ramsey is cooking and is the head chef
Until the Nordics bartender cuts them off and suddenly they're the ones crashing our table where the booze flows freely
Our bar is open 24/7
I remember how he was called the Danish Elon Musk on reddit by his defenders before the conviction

It is suggested to go once a year, however in reality I'll only go if there is an acute necessity
Bad, I know

Yes, for government employees it's a day off
To lessen government spending and not loose efficiency of this day
They will have to work on 2021-05-08 (Saturday)
For private companies it's a company's free choise
Depends on business model and who your major clients are generally
Also a recommendation is that this day should be a holiday and work should be done on 2021-05-08 (Saturday)
Yes, but only because tomorrow is our 2nd independance day and they just moved today to a saturday
It is a day off, since 4th of May (independence restoration day) is free and so there would not be a weird gap we have 4 days free (1st to 4th)
Because of it we will have to work the following Saturday
> Do clean the scissors thoroughly before and after use

Every album from [Skyforger] is more or less really high quality
This particular song because you asked of a national instrument - the strings you hear at the beginning is one of our traditional instruments [kokle] (pronounced kuokle)
They sing mostly in Latvian but have songs in English and Lithuanian as well, would recommend to anyone interested in folk rock/metal
For Latvia it would be the
[līvi- dzelzgriezējs]
Or just most [līvi] songs
Does Joseph Stalin count
Stalin: He was not the best
Mao: Mildly inconvenient
Hitler: A bit bothersome

In Latvian it's just "paldies". After it, you can add pronouns for whom the thank you is intended, but the word itself doesn't change
Uhh, I have no idea how to explain it
Dreary national literature from the 19th century national awakening and the interwar period that, without exception, is chosen to inflict on the children that a Latvian's life is one of suffering and pain, and if anything good happens to one, they'll pay for it later, with interest
For example, one of the mainstays of the curriculum, if I recall correctly, read in about 6th or 7th grade, is called "In the shadow of death" and it is basically a story about fishermen on an ice floe slowly succumbing to death
I mean it probably works if one's ultimate goal is to prepare the kids to be resilient when their land is ravaged by one side or another every generation or so; it's mightily depressing if you want to have well-adjusted people in the peacetime
Any foreign books, like Hamlet, Macbeth, Dante, Kafka, Erich Maria Remarque, and J. D. Salinger, regardless of the subject, were the *fun* parts in literature classes
Latvian language is full of Germanisms
7 centuries under german rule have not gone unnoticed
Our language is basically what you get if you take the ancient proto-indo-european and replace roughly two thirds of the vocabulary with German
Dievlūdzējs - "diev(s)" meaning "God" and "lūdzējs" meaning "(someone who) prays".
[Saule, Pekons, Daugava - Sun, Thunder, Daugava]
Funny how people use to consider Germany discount Austria
- So where are you from
- Latvia
- Do you mean Lithuania
Stranger : where are you from
Me : Latvia
Stranger : Oh so you’re like Russian right
It’s probably around seven

At least a solid 2
* Private health insurance
* Free internet (I work for an ISP)
* Discounted phone plan (~80% off compared to regular price for that carrier)
The word "ieairē" which would translate as "[you] row it in" was the first that came to mind
Although I guess I'm cheating by using a prefix "ie"
We don't really have a _colonized_ version of latvian but we do have latgalian which is a dialect
For me I'd say that written latgalian is mostly understandable but spoken is like 90% complete gibberish
I guess it be the [first awakening] considering it basically created the idea of a Latvian state
And the war of independence and ww1 as well
Most of our food comes from Russia (dishes that are popular, at least) and honestly
sorry to any Russians here but I find most of them absolutely vile, so any family gatherings/weddings/events usually leave me hungry
Though the first thing that comes to mind is that thing where it's meat inside a jelly that's made from beef stock, and people like to dip it in vinegar
It's so disgusting my brain can't even register it as food
Spekmaizes
It’s literally pig fat - not the good bits, just the fat which is supposed to be slow cooked away - served cold on rye bread
Usually served with vodka diluted with the briny pickle juice straight from the can
Which part of that is supposed to sound appealing
Stop ruining my vodka you psychopath fucks
Cold beet root soup
It's basically beets, potato, sausage, eggs and spices with this thing called kefir
Thankfully both me and my husband hate it
The whole country loves it during the summer
2 or 3, all in Rīga (capital)
Opened recently (first one was in like 2016)
And since I love eating chicken, it quickly became my favorite fast food restaurant
Hope they make more and closer to me
Edit: since everyone was comparing  the count with Burger King's and McDonald's we have like 12 McDonalds and none of Burger Kings, although at least 2 are opening very soon this year
We have literally just one KFC in Latvia
I've been there once maybe
Didn't think much of it
KFC is the last fast food joint I'll go
Fake chicken
Burgers suck
I say the same about McDonalds
Can't eat there anymore
Hesburger's the only place we frequent
However I'm not found of new products, it feels they tryin to give less for more by masking it with NEW
I'd say not that much
My wife didn't know how to cook when I met her
After years and years of me cooking in front of her eyes, she knows a lot now
But we could literally go out now and buy a relatively good takeaway food for competitive price in 7 to 10 minutes
Cooking's more like a family day together doing stuff etc
Pretty much everywhere in EU, but probably Finland and Sweden most of all
Maybe also Ukraine
First two because we get a lot of visitors from Finland, especially for hockey games because the tickets and beer are a lot cheaper in Latvia
Sweden because it's just across the Baltic Sea and there's 2 boats per day; most Latvians have done it a few times and it's like a rite of passage as a teenager to take the party boat to Stockholm
Also because of Vikings and more recently Swedish Empire there's a lot of words in modern Latvian that are borrowed from Swedish
Ukraine because there's a lot of Russians in Latvia with Ukrainian heritage, and a lot of Latvians with Ukrainian heritage for that matter
A lot of Ukrainians moved to Latvia after Chernobyl and whatnot
I mean, it's only got Belarus being a visa-requiring douche country in the way otherwise it'd be only a little bit longer a drive than Poland
Sweden
I live closer to Gotland than I do to Riga, I use a Swedish bank, half of our media are owned by Swedish companies, and I think our internet comes from across the Baltic in Sweden
I’d say that it would be Sweden
I’d have put Sweden (and Germany) down for this question
But we kinda share a sea border if exclusive economic sea zones count
Anyway, a fair bit of shared history, assistance during the restoration of independence, even though these days our most notable link with Sweden is enriching your bank shareholders
Italians and French are natural enemies
Just like Spanish and French, English and French, Germans and French, French and other French
**Estonia:**
Had a great weekend in Weeknd Baltic, paid some bus driver to stop for alcohol, lmao
**Lithuania:**
2 cities had the same address, so I was about 150km off my original address
**Denmark:**
Was sleeping on the streets, almost froze to death
**Belgium:**
Tasted many many beers, they are so good
**Germany:**
Saw some street artists playing drums, but drums are plastic barrels
Realistically none
But if Putin's looking for recommendations it would probably be the Latgale region it has its own language and culture plus it houses the largest Russian minority outside of Riga I believe
I love rye bread sandwiches with meat, cucumber, cheese, ketchup and mayonnaise
I have one sandwich i feel guilty for liking because it's really unhealthy
It's white bread, with butter and lots of sugar sprinkled on top
To add to this, the relatively recently appointed Latvian PM (Krišjānis Kariņš) and the very recently elected President (Egils Levits) both seem to be honorable and reasonable persons so that gives me hope that the direction of our country is a good one
Similar developments are taking place in the very powerful Riga municipality, where the rather corrupt mayor has been ousted (funnily enough, the former mayor has now lost a court case against an oposition politician who had called him the face of corruption)
This circus is still in progress though, many people are waiting for the current interim situation to expire so that new election could be held in Riga municipality
The Latvian Naval forces are headquartered in Liepāja, I think everything else is in Riga
Ei vittu saatanaa
If anything, that’s a Swedish thing
1 channel lost its position a decade ago
Nowadays it's TV 3 but it account only for like 9% of all viewers, and it's news, a couple of shows and stuff for kids mainly
We have developed internet platforms
TV boxes and alternative platforms are really popular
I'd say among my generation there's probably no one watching TV channels except occasional news
Commas
The language has a bunch of rules and is extremely complex, but most people trip on incorrect commas
Prescriptivism, people shouldn't really be questioning what the rules for using words in their native language is (oviously doesn't apply to using too many loans and/or words in a way that deviates entirely from socially agreed meaning snd such, but for example, insisting that sensitive can be used only for enotions and you should say s**a**nsitive for phisical sensations, when nobody does that IRL)
I don't think so

Everyone agrees we are Baltics
Everyone disagrees if Baltics are Eastern or Northern Europe
I’m fine with the label of all three
People call Finland Nordic or Scandinavian when the language and history is completely different from vikings
We’re Northern compared to a lot of Europe, but we did used to be in the Eastern Bloc
Northern, Eastern, who gives a shit what label anyone wants to put on it, we’re here on the map, done
And if I’m in a place where no one knows where Latvia is, I’m still gonna say “next to Russia” anyway
That’s another one - I spent most of my childhood in UK and it seriously confused me the first time anyone called it Northern Europe
I’ve always considered it Western Europe
Er, well that part surely isn’t open to interpretation
UK and Ireland are part of the continent of Europe (but maybe not continental Europe, if you see what I mean)
Scandi + Nordic
Not at all
The languages are closely related but not mutually intelligible
Isn’t there a difference between Nordic and Northern
I thought Nordic was for viking countries ie Scandinavia plus Iceland
Classifications that put the Baltics in Northern Europe:
- UNESCO
- EuroVoc
- National Geographic Society
- Committee for International Cooperation in National Research in Demography
- STW Thesaurus for Economics
Classifications that put the Baltics in Eastern Europe:
- CIA World Factbook
Yes that’s true, but for me Brexit is “only” about membership of the EU
They can’t change geography with a referendum, UK will always be part of Europe, no one can take that away
There is no reasonable way to split all European countries into simple North South East West groups
In your model, Denmark is in North, but Latvia which is almost entirely north of Denmark is in East
And you’ve split the Baltic States between North and East, when they are lined up directly North South of each other
Whichever way you do it, someone will disagree
Best to stick with known clusters eg Baltics, Nordics, Scandi, British Isles, Gallia, Benelux, etc
I guess a little bit in a joking way
More so that Latvians and Lithuanians are brāļi (brothers) together with our weird northern cousin (Estonia)
Latvia is better at hockey and when Latvians and Lithuanians start to have a drinking contest, that shit can end dangerously :D
We have pine forests and kippers in Surrey !
Exactly that kind of thing - all the Baltic peoples have eachother’s backs and we recognise that we’re all in pretty similar positions after the history of the last 100 years or so
So, we all get on and stick together and have fun with it I suppose
Yes, of course
Guests do the same
Why would I want to track dirt all over my apartment

There’s a video from Latvian song and dance festival
You can buy rabbit meat in supermarkets here
We have special shops for will boar, deer, etc
And those are expensive
But yeah, we eat that sometimes
When Prisma still was open here, they had packaged farmed deer and moose meat
It was pretty similar in price to beef, if I recall correctly
I'm guessing those specialty shops have hunted wild meat, that's why it's more expensive (well, that, and the obligatory Latvian small business practice of *varka*.)
Varka
Couldn't tell you
Never been to one of those shops
But it you look at canned meats, canned deer is twice as expensive, as good quality canned beef
Rabbit, however, is about the same as beef
There are some expensive cuts of steak that are more expensive, and there are cheap cuts of beef that are less expensive than rabbit, so I'm roughly averaging here
The practice that, when establishing a small to medium business you must first get yourself a BMW X5, Audi Q7 or a Porsche Cayenne; get a mortgage for a decent house somewhere on the better outskirts of Riga; and set aside a tidy sum for yourself for future travels and other personal expenses - only then you can afford to think of such measly things as employee salaries, taxes and settling invoices with subcontractors

The government decides how much to pay teachers, they don't decide on footballers
There is a key difference between the two: there are very few athletes who earn lots of money while there are significantly more scientists
If the sport stars' money was taxed and split amongs scientists they probably wouldn't see the difference
Also you can't blame the fans for supporting their team, buying merchandise and tickets for games
Its just what they do
whats with all the dickheads in the comments
I mean, both are in Europe so that is enough for me

Seriously though, I was horrified thinking about those windows last night
Well there were at least two sources for the news to go by: the firemen stated that they didn't know how much if anything they could save, and I seem to recall that the curch representatives came out with some pretty grim predictions
The latter could be seen as going into panic mode (but still understandable, seeing how it was obviously an emotional moment), but the former was just an honest reply at the time when the fire was the biggest and they didn't know if they could even contaminate it
Mind you that the North tower actually did catch fire for a time
Doesn't UK have any procedure for citizens to call a referendum
Arcanum anyone
I was surprised Latvia isn't in the average category, and same for Romania and Hungary, At least when looking at what countries are in the average category
I wouldn't say worrying for any of us though, Hungary or any of the countries I mentioned aren't in the same category as Russia for sure
But is that comparable to Russia still
Not really, no
And this says most data maps results, not a measure of democracy
Being that bad in 1 category and meh in most others doesn't put Hungary on par with Russia if Russia scores that bad in a multitude of categories and not really above meh in any category for the most part, with a lot of just bad scores
And I mean I bet you Hungary has some of the most trans accepting people in Eastern/Central Europe, this is more important than not being able to legally change your gender for trans peoples wellbeing

>Aren’t Latvians and Lithuanians closely related though
They look very different here
The ancestors of Latvians and Lithuanians were cut off during Northern Crusades, and generally for the next 600 years were part of different countries
As opposed to ancestors of Latvians and Estonians who for around 700 years partially or completely have lived in the same country
More than half a millennia is a lot of time for people to change

Awesome, I hate cold :D
I love being able to bicycle everywhere in February
Climate change is totally a hoax
The evil green activists want your money
I think I remember Brits saying the same thing when they helped Americans  to invade Iraq in 2003, while others Europeans refused
to fuck her
If He stayed abroad, they probably would have kept sending assassins after him, now that he’s in Russian custody though, if he dies, that’s like Putin admitting he murders opposition leaders
And even if they do, he will become hopefully something of a martyr
A lot of judging from this one picture
Reddit: 17k upvotes for a singular retard who raized his hand
Also reddit: yeah supporting communism and posting hammers & sickles and denying genocides commited in communist countries is fine
As hateful, disgraceful and plain stupid as it seems, is there any chance that the photo caught him in an awkward, unintentional moment and/or angle
Because otherwise the levels of irony are just unbearable
Its actually roman salute
This is like 2016 all over again, good job lads
Its finally happening
Those are communists
Taxes and price hikes, while wages stagnate
At least, that's how it started
It's kinda evolving as the days go on, but that was the initial flashpoint
A lot of their points are valid, but they've swung to the extreme hardpoint pretty fast
\>bregzit bad
literally the european version of orange man bad
The people voted, stop pushing it back already
The UK will prosper
glorios Yurop
taxes have nothing to do with phone or internet
Navalny wants Western prosperity and Russian imperialism
He supports Putin's aggressive foreign policy and thinks that Crimea belongs to Russia
He still doesn't understand that the annexation of Crimea and his imprisonment have the same roots
Democracy and Krimnashism aren't compatible - pick one or the other
It's like 2 mobsters having a power struggle to become the next boss of their mafia family
Yup - and still thinks that Crimea belongs to Russia
It's obviously Cologne
SAY MY NAME WHEN YOU PRAY
This is really horrible
Like no one responsible for this decision has seen USSR statistics regarding demography, birthrate and women's health when abortions were illegal
The Polish Government is messed up
SARS immunity was at most 6 months after recovery
Even if that was the case, a considerable portion of recovered COVID patients have bad side effects like diminished lung capacity after recovery
Plus there's a possibility that the virus will mutate into something new by the next season - why do you think flu and the common cold keep coming back every year
Have you read his last tweets
All that "I am winning" whining is hilarious
Trade deals take a long time though, if it is in Biden's term, then it will at best be in year 4
He reminds me of myself when, while drunk, I discreetly moved bar mat closer to myself, rolled it slowly and put it in my jacket while talking to friends
If I had camera facing me I'd look about just as obvious
This seems less embarrasing
This seems like a misunderstanding/confusion whereas if ceremonial pen was any more important, even small theft is way worse
Welcome to the jungle mawfucker
According to UN data for 2015 (so - newer data, the CIA numbers in the OP are for 2011), [Latvia is ahead of Estonia by nearly 1%!]
So - HA, WE WIN at this irrelevant and silly competition
And at Covid
But who’s keeping score
Not me
Never
Not a part of Europe
Further than Ural mountains
Of course it also means that you can't change the rules to fit your cousin or whatever candidate favored for "unrelated" reasons
I will not stand this
These people deserve better
Haiku assemble
I think people don't know what nazi means, there are other words to describe extremists, but go to one is nazi because it is the scary word
Edit: i have no idea what is this golden dawn, im talking about extremists in general and how everyone always gets called a nazi
sure, but that is not what I am trying to oppose
Like an inverted status quo
Even possible
lol
Never, because this is a common design issued by all the eurozone for some EU anniversary and many people probably wouldn't like the childish aesthetic of it enogh to pay for looks
What you need to do is get your hands on micronation commemorative euros, but that's probably going to cost you more than 2€ to begin with
This is equivalent to cutting out people's tongues in the middle ages
It just shows that the state is afraid of what they have to say
This "protest" is just a reason for kids to skip school
The leader has no clue what she is talking about and has no real suggestions for the governing bodies rather than "reeeeee".
Spez-----
Have you people actually listened to the kid
She answered the question of "What is wrong with the climate" with "Everything". She literally has no fucking idea what she wants
Go maybe protest China and their lack of efforts for minimizing the climate change
Nope what
Maybe I have missed some memo where it's written up what her suggestions/demands are
How the hell is it acceptable for a leader of a movement to not have an answer or solution to a problem the movement is protesting
By saying that you are implying that it's not really her problem, but the problem of the state
She just "raises awareness"? I have enough of awareness raised, I don't need kids skipping school to make me understand that climate change exists
I, too, like to speak a million sentences without actually saying anything
You answered your question in the very same comment
They don't have any understanding of climate change, and very certainly a lot less than your average governing body
All I am saying is don't fucking protest for a cause of you don't have a solution for
You said that it's an intricate matter, and I won't deny it, it's not as easy as "lol wind power now".
Don't expect some suits to figure out a way to fix your life just because you bitched about it a bit on a Friday afternoon and held a sign with a funny punchline
Balkan nationalism is the most idiotic ever
Most of you speak the same language
So here's a village that's inhabited by people who look like us and speak the same language
So we should exterminate every single of them and put them in a mass grave
130k+ people had to die in the Yugoslav wars
Balkan nationalist logic is incomprehensible to me
its times like these when I wonder
how stupid must you be to do such a thing
Steam and other services made stealing obsolete
It's actually ephebophilia
Yeah, I've heard this bullshit before
It's stealing and you know it
Everyone knows it
Stop pretending
People pirate, because they want to get shit without paying
I know - I did it as well when I was younger and stupider
No, they didn't. Pirates are pieces of shit
No it isn't easier
Stop lying
In the age of steam sales you can have 1000 games in your steam library that you don't even play
Thieves have no excuse these days
It's still taking shit without paying
I work in software development and want to get paid
If you still steal in the era of Steam sales, Spotify, Netflix and Youtube, then you're a horrible piece of shit
Get a job and get out of your parent's basement for once
It's both
Libertarianism is an idiotic ideology
We can already see how it (doesn't) work in darknet and crypto markets
Turns out that without government regulation scams and thievery run rampant
>With the exception of recently released blockbusters, **there is no evidence to support the idea that online copyright infringement displaces sales
So there's actual evidence that piracy negatively affects sales
This is why Denuvo and other DRM solutions are used
To prevent piracy in the first few months or weeks
It doesn't muddy anything
Piracy is using something without paying
Sure - it's more comparable to sneaking into cinema or concert hall without paying
But it's still just as wrong as stealing
Average day in Denmark
here is a good video about this subject
short story : Soviets treated their disabled people like total fucking garbage, even their WW2 veterans
So much for the ''glorious victor nation'' indeed
Nothing has changed since then
Russians chose Putin for the same reason
*In early September it came, a war unknown to the world
Lmao
On 9th of May Russia and several other post-soviet states celebrate Victory day, which was heavily popularized in USSR by Breznem (I think), thus the reason for sudden surge of Soviet military posts
Well maybe we delayed a climate change just a little bit
*Sorts by controversial*
This is where the fun begins
One aspect of that I've seen talked about is basically that, even if we talk about USSR, we're talking about seven decades, while the part where the Soviet Communist implementation of the ideology was compareable to Nazism was really under one leader
Not that the other times were good as such in the Soviet Union, but they were certainly not AS bad, or bad in a different sense (civil war, for example)
This is a problem because, for example, if you look at a decade like the 60s where USSR was doing nothing worse than sending people to work camps, torturing them in KGB basements and arresting people for listening to rock'n'roll, and claim that it was as bad Nazis - well, it just wasn't, the amount of people killed, tortured and put in camps was much lower
Which kinda discredits the idea of likening the two regimes
whataboutwhataboutwhatabout
Can we all just use kelvin, Dalton and other unknown mesurment units
I actually found that for rough measurements feet are just right
Short distances, for example a room
I walk putting 1 foot in front the other, count and multiply by 31
At least say that it's a repost, OP
Edit: autocorrect
Well at least the Americans didn't loot or rape
>Did not this heights began in Munich with your Chamberlain and their Mussolini and Daladier
Please tell me what where the material benefits for UK and France from the Munich deal as opposed to what the Soviets gained from Molotov Ribentrop act
Might as well compare paying protection money with extorting protection money
Will you just randomly post more replies to my comment
Regarding the benefits Germany received
After the pact with Soviets Germany received more than half of Europe and strategic war resources from Soviets, which landed Germans at the actual height of their power
>Saving them from war
Soviets invaded Poland, so what you are saying is blatantly false
Ah, if it's not my favourite method of learning about the culture of my fellow Europeans - through a pile of delicious pastries

This is why countries exist, because we each have our own values and traditions
This is why I am against immigration from outside Europe because I don't trust government to properly assimilate these immigrants
You dont have to tell me that, we have like 40% russian population
Also i said outside europe, we in europe kinda get each other to some extent

Brave people
I wish them all the luck possible
I can't imagine what it takes for Russians to be out on the streets of Moscow protesting
They're fully aware of the brutality of the Kremlin and yet they proceed
Now that's courage
Why
No matter who rules over Russia - they all think that Latvia must be annexed to Russia
When Stalin died Khruschev didn't give us independence
Even if they overthrow Putin - whatever replaces him will still think that we are Nazis and Crimea will not be returned to Ukraine
And they might give that control to someone worse than Putin
So - no thanks
Why
Their so-called opposition still thinks that Crimea belongs to Russia and that Baltic states are a bunch of russophobic nazis who should also be reeducated and annexed to Russia
Nemtsov was different, but they killed him
Existing situation when Russia is ruled by FSB is one of the worst possible
There always is a hope that Russia will no go in circles in it's  politics in the future
People in Russia definitely aren't  bad only part of them is influenced by one sided propaganda
If they overthrow Putin - whatever replaces him will not be much better
Even "liberal" Navalny doesn't want to return Crimea
Russia always goes in circles
100 years ago they had a revolution where they overthrew their Tsar
Yeah, he was a tyrant and not a good guy
But what did come after
Liberal democracy
Equality and civil rights for all
No - a much worse regime that started the worst war in history and murdered millions
In the 90s that regime collapsed under its own weight
And what came after that
Liberal democracy
Nope - a bad joke of a president, oligarchs and mafia running the country and then the economy collapsed
And what did the Russians learn from all that
They put another dictator in power in 2000 and he's been running the country ever since
So what makes anyone think that after getting rid of this dictator there finally be liberal democracy in Russia and not something much worse than Putin
Even Navalny doesn't want to return Crimea
No one Russian politician would return Crimea to Ukraine soon
It would be political suicide
But there are many thing that could be done to improve the situation
Free movement of people and sea traffic to Azov sea , economic agreements etc
Any protester who just wants the government to steal a bit less and be a bit less corrupt, but otherwise agrees with its foreign policy - deserves his beating, because he still hasn't learned anything
And recognising Soviet occupation and giving back Abrene will also be political suicides
That's why I don't really give a shit who's in power in Russia - they're all bad
At least Putin is somewhat predictable and it's unlikely that he's going to attempt an invasion into a NATO country
WTF
Why did she moved to East
That's admirable and incredibly stupid at the same time
Not anymore
I got a speeding ticket in Estonia for going 56 in 50, I am still salty about it

Eh, it's meme even outside the Internet - the flag was modeled after a one-line description in a Medieval chronicle that doesn't explain the colors
The only explanation for our (Latvian) flag I ever heard was this legend about a tribe chief being laid on a white sheet and bleeding out - it was stained with blood on the sides and stayed white where the body was
The sheet was used as a flag in the next battle which they won
because Suomi > Finland
and Finland < Funland
I'm scrolling through reddit, wanting to find something about Latvia, my country
Found something
Not what I wanted/expected tho ;-;
I think this bodes well with general law of 'not being a dickhead'.
I don't know where that screenshot is from in your second link but even if (especially if) it's from some official source, it says that a sticker alone isn't enough to charge with petty hooliganism
> If such a word is placed on a car, and isn't otherwise promoted, for example, by shouting or otherwise expressing, such writing isn't suitable basis for sanctioning
It is much more likely that he got the hooliganism charge for something else
Also, the punishment for that is a monetary fine, instead of roadside alterations to one's vehicle
This looks rather like the officer's interpretation of letting him off easy
They charged him with hooliganism and not wearing a seat-belt
His GF got fine for leaving the car without permission
They cannot explicitly force you to do it, nor is it forbidden by law to have such a sticker
However, 1) the police officer might not be a law scholar and is overstepping his bounds or 2) is letting him off easy and not charging him for something else
None law
There doesn't exist such a thing in the law here
It is also a non-existent law
We got worse food y'know
Like the bread soup
Or the watermelon milk
Ew, don't get me started on the watermelon milk
It's terrible thoo ;-;
Haha, most of the people I meet online don't even know what Latvia is
It feels nice hearing all your stories from times you've been in Latvia or just these thoughts
Pretty cool that you even know what it is XD
Someone stole my bicycle and the police immediately sent 2 patrol cars to search for it in the direction where this moron drove
They found the guy like after 15 minutes
Honestly, love our police, can't say anything bad about them, so probably murican dream
He's just living the murican dream
Honestly, I once drive with my parents and the police stopped us
We were supposed to pay a fine of 50 euros, because we were driving 90 kph when we were supposed to drive 80
well since it was late and everyone was tired, that police guy actually let us go, and just said that he won't let us go next time
I love the cops here XD
You gonna diss our bean salad
Your country fucked us in two wars
I thought our national food was gray peas, but here we are, talking about bean salad ;-;
What
WHAT
Germany is always associated with Hitler anyways
What's that bad about A GODDAMN BEAN SALAD
Puts things into perspective
Well done
Of course the irony is that Turkey is not there, even though Turks have actually attacked and killed Russian soldiers and their allies in the last few years, and multiple times at that
But instead of Turks we have the real threat of Russia at full display here : the scary scary Latvia, with its 2 million population
It should be renamed ''list of countries that are convenient to hate for Putin at this moment, might change every 5 minutes depending on circumstances and corruption''
It feels good to be here
Right
Yaaawn
I guess the guys in front of the screen obscure a "Page 1 of 22" message
And the list definitely includes Russia
Damn Russians
They ruined Russia
*Sees latvia on the list*
*Chuckles* I'm in danger
lmao ofc most occupied countries made it
they even were so nice to include all the baltics
What did Georgia do to piss Russians off
UK flag says “Great Britain”, so Northern Ireland doged the bullet
Welcome to the club
Indeed
lol I live here in Latvia, and I have been to Turkey myself too
I really really dont think its worse here than over there
By what metric do you base your statement
It wasn't the current Russians that did that
The current Russia is a successor of those states, though
Should you be though
Last thing I heard just 2 days ago your minister of economics pleaded how building of NS2 should not be politicised
It's a bit more than I'd like, but then I remember the -20 we're probably going to get in January and all of a sudden I'm good with this
Technological factors will prevent dropping gas or other fosilie fuels from providing the district heating needs
Mostly because in winter, cogeneration is extremely useful, the infrastructure is there and it's very expensive to replace
District heating with hot water is a very very good source of heating for high-density populated ares, the technology is robust and adaptable
It's way cheaper than electricity and for now also than low temperature district heating, which is achieved with wasted heat and heat pumps, which comes with its own challanges
Like it's not easy to make hot tap water with low temperature district heating, which raises risk of water-born patogens
Heck, heat pumps just now reached long term cost parity with gas, for the price of making 1 kwh, but still require substantially more initial investment, and have problems with winters below -15C.
So yeah, gas is here to stay, all we can do is diversify, insulate and renovate buildings, make hybrid systems
But gas will still be there in 20, 30, even 50 years, just hopefully at a smaller role
Yeah, geothermal is a godsend as far as becoming non-reliant on fossil fuels goes
Most other places can hope for low-temperature district heating at best by using a hybrid of heat pumps and solar arrays, with some electric and fossil backup
It's actually not easy at all, without a titanic investment and holistic approach which are not favored in modern market economies
It's first and foremost an economic problem
Let me explain why this is such a huge technological problem
Switch to electricity as the main source of heat will require the revamp of all electrical grids, in many cases a complete replacement will be required
Not just grids, most housing is not designed with electric consumption levels that accommodate heating
In some older buildings having a water boiler, an electric kettle and an oven on at hte same time could lead to a local black-out, and having electric heating is like adding an equivalent of 4-8 extra always-on kettles
Switch to electric heating will require systems that seasonally should be able to give out upwards to x10 (probably more) the nominal power consumption, specially in extra cold weather
This means that we will need that much more raw electric power during winter
I am not talking about the already existing day/nigh electrical use disparity which will become even more evident
No only that, but accommodating this disparity will lead to more energy loss in transfer
Mitigating these fluctuations is a very tough problem now, and will become even greater problem in the future
We will need to build pump storage or find a way to balance the grids
That's just one of the reasons why a total switch to electricity, when compare to the circulating insulated hot water systems, has huge technological challenges, and why some form of burning fuel will always be desired
There's also other kinds of civil engineering and industrial systems whose MO heavily relies on the existence of hot water district heating
As I mentioned it, the far more likely scenario is the switch to low temp systems, and there are some pilot projects being built rightn ow all across the world with some positive and some mixed results
Time will tell
This view is nothing to be proud of
So what ? Execute who needs to be executed, but this was good old medieval type display to satisfy the crowd
Government might have not got it
I've only seen them at the riga marathon
East German communists and their friends being afraid of losing their power and privileges I presume (which of course they did)
You have a Christmas market this year
A day trip to Tallinn, an overnight stay in Latvia or a two night trip (or an exhausting overnight trip) to Lithuania, you do the math
Oh, that's nice
We don't have one and I'm afraid a Christmas market here would be an uncontrollable experience
Stay safe
biggest economy, and so it also has the biggest interest for its nearby countries to not fucking die and go bankrupt since thats German markets where they make money
Would the solution be *final*?
This is pretty dank, if I do say so myself
Okay what kind of shitposting is this now

I'm more baffled that one of my country's representatives voted No on the directive but at the same time voted No on possible amendments
Why
I'm sure several people voted like that and overall the result of the first vote could be different
There's no way they are stopping a rebellion the size of the internet tho
TBH, 5 million is around 1% of EUs population
> corrupt politician
Not necessarily corrupt
50+ something old dudes and ladies are hardly experts on anything that involves IT, they have old fashion law degrees, and don't understand a single internet nuance
In other words, they aren't automatically corrupt, most likely they tech-dumb and their opinions are stuck in the 80-90s pre-internet era, with a pinch of shills among them to wave their fists at the internet
Fun fact: 11
November 1919 was a turning point in Latvian independence fights
So, today we celebrate this turning point, while the end of WWI is put in the background
Keep fighting at least the world will know in the worst case

Sometimes it feels like people driving cars think that they are still sitting in those carnival bumper cars instead of piloting a ton of steel at a speed that can kill
Not that the rest of the traffic participants are any better
God, I can't wait for automated cars to become mandatory
> Well, sometimes bikers seem to feel like THEY are the ones sitting in a 2 ton truck, industructible by human means
Oh, I completely agree
The things I have seen cyclists do (high speed corner cutting without knowing what is behind the corner; having no concept of what the specific traffic sign means while being completely sure they are in the right; driving in the opposite direction of the traffic etc
That is why I said that nihilism exhibited by certain drivers can also be observed in other traffic participants
It is not like cyclists/drivers/pedestrians come from different parts of society
As a cyclist myself I have come to the conclusion that following all the traffic rules is not the best way how to drive
The preferable method is by minimizing all possible contacts/conflicts with other people on the road (no matter if you are in the right or not)
ez kid, fat dub

A lot of the places have contitution that says marriage is a union between man and a woman
And it's often controversial to propose major changes to it so issues like these are not addressed
Some places opt for some form of legal route that doesn't label it as marriage
But marriage on its own is pretty aged tradition and the way I see it, it should be a secondary term anyway as generally religious institutions practice it - I wouldn't force any religous institution to unify anyone they don't want as their whole process is based on opinions and traditions
Adults, however, should be able to legally form unions as they please but if we stray too far then where do we set boundaries - up to how many people can legally be in a union
At one point we will find people just making unions for legal reasons alone
For example back in Sovet Union, at some point, newly weds would get x amount of boxes of vodka from government so my dad's first student "marriage" was to just get free stuff
It's a shame to know my country doesn't allow gay marriage
Latvia and Lithuania soon will be in the light blue column
And thanks to western woke leftists - it's going to stay that way
If you marry elsewhere, it will be legally recognized, however, gay couples cannot marry in any form
But long will sun-light day last on 17th of January
So it's gonna be what a 5 minute day
Dont want to be nitpicky, but this isnt a castle
Its just a walled town
A castle would have a central keep of sorts
Baltic states escaped this fate in the chaos of 1990's, Baltic politicians of that era were quick enough in grabbing the opportunity to brake away while Russia was busy with their own problems
we too had Russian military bases here with a shit load of Russians soldiers just like Crimea, but using the disarray of recent USSR collapse and help from Balts living in USA, our politicians were able to make deals with Bill Clinton and Yeltsin that made sure Russians would leave, permanently, and would have no influence over those 3 little countries by military means
Ukraine failed to do it, they allowed Russian bases in Crimea to stay and didn't set clear goals for what their future will look like
and is now, 25 years later, they are paying the grim consequences of that
Sad of course, but then again it was sort of expected
There is no way Russia would allow Ukraine (or any other former USSR republic) to stay neutral while sitting in between NATO and Russia, Baltic leaders knew that already in 1991 and did what they could to make sure they wouldn't be caught in the crossfire
Ukraine, did not
I still can’t believe I live in this timeline
This shit sometimes feels absurd
Hope this shit closes mink farms for good

Latvia is mostly green :)
Poland looks like coal paradise
Well, one should also take into account the market and sources
If you import electricity, you can import it from renewable sources at a different tariff, giving buying priority to green energy
having authoritarian leader who is not wanted by the people tends to have similar results across the board
aww man
It's much darker in Sweden than US
Sweden has less annual sunlight hours than Alaska does, much less continental USA
Light requires electricity
if it didnt happen where do they think all the jews went
Are those the  same 1,120 people
Also iit would be interesting to know how it was done
Oh jeez, I feel you
It was around +27C here today, our AC at work hasn't been installed yet, and the whole work day was like one long sauna session
I hiked along the entire Latvian-Estonian border line a couple of years ago (~350 km) and within that border alone there were plenty of tiny "international" bridges in all shapes and conditions
Basically every time a road crosses a border, since most of the border line is marked by a ditch
That's what she said
Whatever it is, it can't be worth it
Making a personal embargo to Poland
It'll be like 3 extra seconds per item in the supermarket just to check if it's not made in Poland, or designed in Poland, but until the ruling party changes, I'm willing to make that sacrifice

Who gives the most aid to Serbia
Eu has given 1 billion 800 million dollars
Kosovo is not a part of Serbia
>How about they pay for the damage they caused in 1999
you mean for the wars Serbs started and refused to end and then had the audacity to attack and kill UN peacekeepers
I think its them who should pay , not the other way around
> but that's just like your opinion dude
There's always two sides in every conflict
yes, sure
Nazis also had some good points then
>I'm staying not everything is exactly like your media made you believe
there is no excuse for this , this is in line with what Nazis did, pure and simple
Motives and justification same as Serbian crime, just the numbers are different
Not sure how this helps your view there
Want to say ''We Nazis is oke because 70 years ago other Nazis did it too

Thousands
8,372 killed by execution and rape in Srebrenica
NATO bombing : Human Rights Watch estimate: 489–528 civilians
yea try again mate , not even close
And NATO action did actually end the war and put a end to all this
What did Serbian actions did
Ahh right, try to ethnically cleanse whole regions of people they didn't like
You seriously going to compare the 2
It doesnt look to good now does it
> Human rights watch is biased
right, and glorious Serbian authoritarian dictatorship of that time is not
Sure , those guys were the truthful ones
It's located in former East Germany
Everything is cheaper
Isn't that technically an arrest, albeit made in an oppressive dictatorship, rather than abduction
But is it like semi-legal arrest of someone who perhaps does not like Lukashenko's government or do they e.g. take random persons from streets to woods for no reason connected to being police/regime other than it giving them more ability to do so
There are different implications between the two
No, but your regime probably does, so if it's an arrest then it indicates that something is wrong with the country, not just criminal activity, plus if it is criminal activity by police force that is not sanctioned/controled by the regime then maybe things have gone even worse than before
What is going on right now
There were protests with reports of pretty wild police violence, but now have they managed to oppress most of protests
Is it still the same with protests going on and the regime policing around
Is it worse

Yeah, I was looking for the source as well
Norway and Switzerland are in a far different relationship with EU than UK now is
they are almost members of EU formally since they abide by most of its laws (especially Switzerland, whos economy is very much tied with EU as this point), UK said it didn't want to abide any of them
So no, UK is not even the same group
> The UK is continuing to abide by many EU regulations
its a very wide and varied group and no you cant just bunch them together
UK right now towards EU has the same kind of relationship as Canada, and no its not ''continuing to abide by many EU regulations'', thats just flat out not true
Norway and Switzerland have all of them (these 15 at least)
So no, UK is not like them, not even anything near it
i love old European style architecture
Are those Bauhaus style buildings
I believe at least in Latvia's case its due to open borders and emigration
I mean I'm all for opportunities to seek better lives elsewhere, but at the same time I feel like rural regions get abandoned by the young and the old die out

Oh god I am in the middle of this exact pain

My grandparents were deported to Siberia
There's no difference between the USSR and Nazi Germany
What happened there
Road broke
I've heard that in Belgium some parents ask rent from their kids once they turn 18
I've seen this said a few times and every time I think - ah, there's the difference in mentality
To me, contributing to household expenses means buying some groceries and household items, covering other costs when it makes sense (when you're near a shop anyway, when you have more time, when you have ready cash and parents don't etc
It's all flexible and nobody keeps track, you go by feeling
It's never (and my parents would consider it crazy to ask) a set amount every month
Because when you expect a certain amount at a certain day every week/month, then I call it "rent" no matter where the money goes after
Of course, some kids can be assholes and this "sense of duty" based system won't work for everyone
But I've never met anyone in my country who would be charged rent (a specific amount of money) by their parents
I wasn't arguing that it's a lot of money or not fair
I'm just saying that in different countries you look at these things differently - we would call these €2-300 "rent", and it doesn't happen a lot
We would most likely contribute by buying goods instead of transferring money
It's just a different approach, I was pointing *that* out
So they created a bit of fake news just to create outrage at Russia over nothing

And a very tasty one
I put on some 4 kilos in 2 weeks while there despite doing a lots of walking up and down the hills in merciless heat most of the time

An insane explosion happened right across the street from my house, Latvia
[More] [footage]  here's [another angle] from the building right by it
I tried posting mine but sadly instagram links get removed here
It was insane, my whole house shook to the core and ears were ringing
I live about 100meters from that building so yeah, first time experiencing something so crazy and unexpected, considering it happened at 1:20am
It's been about 7 hours since this happened and things are finally calm, no firefighters or medics outside and just people taking care of the rubble
There's no official cause yet, but people suspect a gas leak explosion
[It's all over news] but obviously they're [in latvian] so yall probably wont get too much info out of it
So far only 1 person has been confirmed dead and about 8 injured, but it's hard to imagine the number is that small considering a huge chunk of a building straight up vanished
People are already saying that 2020 isn't giving up till the last second
Imagine that there probably was a family ready to celebrate new years in one of those apartments
*Edit:* Apparantly the newest info from experts is that it wasn't a gas explosion, which is very curious
A criminal investigation has begun
Here's [a local news source in English
The final numbers are lucky since many apartments in that building were thankfully empty
1 dead and 6 injured, 2 with minor wounds
Would you say the emergency response was fast and sufficient
> People are already saying that 2020 isn't giving up till the last second
We also had a record Covid case number and record positive test rate today
We'll probably soon be near the top in Europe per capita
And people are still planning NY parties even with the curfew in effect
The gas company says it's not gas
In that house had only one apartment connected to the gas, and that apartment was on the other side of the house and the gas infrastructure doesn't seem to be damaged
That doesn't exclude the possibility that the apartment had their own portable gas cylinder
Investigation is ongoing

Well it's actually our capital Riga, which is run-down as well, particularly thanks to the 10 year reign of the party Saskaņa. The cities in regions are usually better-maintained and more aesthetically pleasing than our own capital
But with the new mayor, I hope the situation will change
I don't know, apart from the graffiti and the obvious pile of debris and destruction it doesn't look all that run down
The lighting is really bad but it just looks like any random pre-war building
Looking at it in streetview, it could probably do with a thorough cleaning and a coat of paint but I've seen buildings of similar (and worse) decrepitude in many major European capitals
Riga
Oh for sure, there were emergency services, firefighters and cops all around
Definitely more than enough
The only thing I could mention is that while watching it all happen from my window, firefighters came in last
Cops and medics where there almost instantly it seemed like
Gas ovens and stoves are the best
We have frequent power outages and people like to be able to cook or boil water in such cases
Not in Riga
There power outages are a rare thing
Growing up in an apartment in Purvciems I dont remember having any power outages
Real reason why most people still use gas stoves is because gas is way cheaper than electricity
For cooking
Bruh, tell Warsaw it be lookin hella fine lately
Terrible disgrace for Dutch soldiers
I get that they where outnumbered and outgunned and its easy for me to be all righteous sitting in my cozy office job, but in this occasion there was no alternative to courage, just shame
Survivors guilt is a real thing even for helpless civilians, but what if you are armed soldier with a task to protect the people being slaughtered
This is fucked up
We haven't learned this because it was new stuff at the time
News, not history
Which is one of the problems with learning history in school, your are in 5th grade, learning stuff that happened 15 years ago, or whatever book you government approved most recently, but since you don't delve into politics on your free time - everything that happened after that flies above your head until you are older and take an interest
I agree, but then again standards for soldiers are a bit higher then for middle aged professional whos a bit on the chubby side
How dare I expect sense of duty, courage and integrity from soldiers
Dying while protecting civilians who you are tasked to protect is not death for nothing
Also an argument could be made that some ragtag militia form backwater bumblefuck would not even dare to attack if some determination to resist had been demonstrated
Right wing
You mean, like conservative leaning people or what exactly
Chill guys
There is a legitimate discussion buried under these insults, don't throw the baby out with the bathwater

Louis XIV once has said 'L'etat c'est moi' ('I am the state')
ahem, f*ck commies, f*ck soviets, f*ck stalin, f*ck the revolution
All of the occupied countries would be way, way better off without the sickness that the rabid communist dictators brought onto this world
nobudy says Baltic SS legions were "liberators" , and only the early units were volunteer based (which why they were very small in size, they grew into whole legions only after people were being forcefully conscripted)
And by the way, Nazi ideology is banned and attacked in Baltics just like the Communists, so I dont understand why people try to pose this view that somehow if Soviets are bad somewhere then Nazis must be good, no they are not both are shit on
He is arguing against you blatantly trying to derail this post
> These units were still ran by Nazis
nobudy has ever said it wasnt , it was part of SS of course it was
>many of the men sympathised with the Nazis
''many'' is the debatable part, if there is conscription there is no real way to prove if you are sympathizing or you are just doing what you are told so you dont get shot or sent to concentration camp as a deserter (which was common)
This is a totalitarian system that was desperate for any fighting men it could get at all costs by 1942 already
>I had some person earlier tell me how these SS units weren't Nazis
depends on what exactly you mean by it
You mean the overall organisation
Of course it was Nazi creation and commanded
But if you call all of its members ''Nazis'', that would not be correct since they didnt join it out of free choice
Thats like saying all Red army units and soldiers were ''Communists'', they were not for that same principle, you did as you are told and nobudy asked or cared if you ''believed in Lenin and his ideology''
> but I still feel that they weren't heroes
they are portrayed as ''heroes'' here, but as victims who for more than 50 years were judged guilty of things they had no influence over
Whats where the Latvian position stands . The ''Latvian legion day'' is not a celebration day, but a day of mourning
It seems thats something a lot of people seem to not understand
>Then we agree that they were Nazis since they fought for Nazi Germany
if you are forced to fight, are you also part of that philosophy
I dont think ''I am doing this so I dont die and my family doesnt die'' counts as ''I am a Nazi''. Nazi implies you are member and supported of their general philosophy and ideology
>I have no issues with agreeing that Latvians conscripted into the Red Army were Soviets
Soviets
not Communists then
Those words are not the same
Don't judge dude, he might be, he might not be
Not surprising my country out of all 3 would have the most porn stars, ofcourse we are the most depressed, we have the worst education system, and those Estonians and Lithuanians are saying their life is shit

Prostitution is legal
We should be proud
First of all I would like to see the list because I suspect bullshit
There's no reason for the difference to be so big among Baltic countries
It's not what these other guys are saying, it doesn't have anything to do with there being more Russians or us being poorer (we are not that far from Estonia and decently close to Estonia) it's that prostitution is legal in Latvia

As a Latvian studying Lithuanian language I can say that the languages are really different and further than Dutch is to German
Latvian has the stress always on the first syllable while Lithuanian has a mobile stress system where it changes from word to word
There are tons of False friends in our languages and you just can't assume their meaning, for example:
palikt = to stay (in LV)
palikti = to leave (in LT)

What memo
Did The-Gateway-To-France send them any memo
Don't think so - they have enough regions which would like to break off :)
They have their own language that's actually being spoken by the people
I heard more Maltese during 2 weeks that I spent in Malta than Irish during 4 years that I spent in Ireland
Believe or not, but it's possible to keep your native language and still have English as an official language
But for some reason they teach Irish in every school
Not just in those that are located in the Gaeltacht
What's the point
I'm pretty sure they don't teach Basque in Paris and Madrid
In the exports section don’t forget about Adol
never mind, we don’t talk about that
No, not much
They robbed all the Central and Eastern European states after WW2 as ''reparations'', took anything that was valuable back to USSR and left their ''Warsaw pact allies'' with crap
Its more like they advance their own technology on the expense of their neighbors, not the there way around

This map feels like a shitpost for people who think that the EU is going to evolve into a federal state
I don't know about Baltic states tho
Central, northern, easthern
Not really
I think the Baltic states being lumped in with Central Europe, but because they aren’t very similar to Northern or Eastern Europe, can’t you just call them North Eastern Europe
The Balkans are classified as south-eastern
right i've heard eastern, i've heard northern, i've heard north-eastern, this is a fucking new one wow
"Very very slowly"... I see what you did there

You had very rich upbringing and had great time, while i had strict, but in the end much better family than our previous one
But then Russian Family decided to kidnap us
Apparently they knew we were siblings, so decided they could get more money out of it
they never received any money and eventually forced us to be their children instead
Me, being 15, and you 17 it was very difficult time, since we werent easily susceptible children anymore
The beatings, shouting
then Ms

Who knew she was an agent after all these years i was with her
The next year was good, but then Russians came back
They killed Ms

2 years since we had a winter this cold
I dont have a problem with cold weather but my cars doors were frozen shut at -19C which is annoying
Also went to a self service car wash the other day and left with a thick layer of ice on my car because everything freezes almost instantly in this weather
This is unusual only because it’s like that now
It should’ve been like this in December/January

Anyway, sounds like someone is trying to exaggerate the numbers (and thus damaging an actually decent cause)
The problem is that it can't be dealt with
There are some things which protesters are ignoring
Green energy is more expensive, so production plants, which are using much electricity or heat will loose competitiveness to other countries, which is no so green
They will bankrupt or will go abroad
That happened to only metallurgical plant in Latvia, which lose competitiveness to Chinese steel, because our tariff on electricity contain part which are used to support green energy and that was too much
The other thing is that green energy, due to fact that green energy producers are receiving subsidies, is a nice source of corruption itself
( Like a garbage business )
That happened in Latvia too, where rich families and previous politicians are doing both green energy and garbage business
The business is big, but produced part of the green energy -small
Yeah it can in places like Netherlands, Germany etc, but it can't be dealt in places like Eastern Europe, or even in 3rd world countries its worse
Only you need The World Illuminati government for that
Going on streets and protesting is always an option
And easy to accomplish
Not true

They exist so that Putin can look reasonable compared to them
The problem is that brexiters don't want a deal that's similar to those of Norway or Switzerland
If they wanted that then there would not be any problems - the EU would sign that deal immediately
Unlike Norway and Switzerland the UK is not even in Schengen area, for example
But instead they want to crash out with no deal whatsoever
Even May's deal makes the UK less integrated with the EU than EEA/Switzerland
I don't mind them using a loophole if there is one
And reportedly it's already being fixed, so some of you that are angry about companies not paying taxes you want them to pay, soon they will have to find another loophole
expensive but itll be good
This kind of weather is very hard to bear

A lot of people I know who would have been religious are instead into some weird esoteric stuff or a choose-your-own-adventure style of exploration into Eastern stuff, or some other random crap, like they're "not religious but spiritual," etc
Graphs like these don't signify the rise of logic and pure thought that you might want to see
People don't change that fast; I bet a lot of them are still into magical thinking
At least with religion and Christianity it's a familiar and predictable form of insanity
With the weird crap floating around today, who knows
Latvia — some weird mix between the two
\>Lithuania hardly became Christian voluntary, it took a full Crusade to "convince" them to convert
Although to be fair the same is true for northern Germany and the Netherlands and many areas of Europe
&#x200B;
And one of those 'many areas'  would happen to be Estonia (+Latvia=Livonia)
It's even exactly the same crusade
Crusade does not explain religious differences between very catholic Lithuania+Latgale and very agnostic rest of Latvia+Estonia
"Sasodīts" is what a Ned Flanders character would say, something along the lines of "gosh darn it". In no way is it similar to actual speech patterns of real people
Maybe some little old lady would say that in polite company when she's dropped her crocheting needles, although I suspect that she's seen more than you think and could outdo a drunken stevedore in profanity
"Sasodīts" is pretty pg, translated it means "damned". If you wanted to be more hip you'd definitely use something like "bļa" which as you might guess is just the translitered Russian "blyat". We use a lot of Russian swear words
Sameish for Latvia

This is giving me eurovision vibes
Welcome, Bulgaria
Is this a list of countries with common sense
Does Russia have a list with their client states as well
Germany and France would be top positions
Finland and Russia had horrible relations for most of the time Finland has existed as independent country (Soviet Moscow's view was that Finland as a state is a temporary mistake that will be fixed soon, just like the Baltic states), only reason it changed was Cold war made it risky for Soviets to keep this hostility and ''we want to destroy you, just you wait'' attitude due to fear that NATO could use that against them, so they pretended that they are on good terms
and even then, both sides kept battle ready armies at all times pointed at each other, all the way to modern day actually
Finland still maintains massive military, biggest artillery force in Northern Europe and full on conscription for all of its males age 18+, and its no secret towards who its all aimed at
''good neighbors'' don't do that
Russia keeps Finland alone now, because Finnish military has grown so strong in the last 30 years that Russia cant afford to bully them anymore how they used to
2008 war
I know, but again, they kind of had a special situation going on there that allowed them to be in that possiton
many other countries did not, such as Poland or Czechoslovakia, Soviets didn't even want to contemplate these places not being under iron fist of Moscow
So saying ''just be like Finland'' is naive, most simply even have such a choice
>You have to count in finlandization
I know what that is, but again, they kind of had a special situation going on there that allowed them to be in that possiton to begin with
many other countries did not, such as Poland or Czechoslovakia, Soviets didn't even want to contemplate these places not being under iron fist of Moscow and their occupation
So saying ''just be like Finland'' is naive, most simply dont have such a choice
Ukraine nowadays doesn't have either, for example (Russia didnt even try some sort of dialogue with Ukrainians before they annexed Crimea the way they did with Finland, they just forced their rule and thats it)
> So while the Baltic countries are eager to wave middle fingers at Russia because they believe in their friend United States
Baltic states do it, because Baltic states have no such luxery as what Finland has
I dont think many people know, but Baltic states also declared neutrality and expressed their desire to stay out of World war 2 and not pick sides exactly the same as Finland did
Soviets came and forced their rule anyway
Moscow never even wanted to negotiate such a thing as these countries not ''belong to them'', not then not now either
Only thing that kept them away was American pressure
>It doesn't mean Finlandization, but a constant converstation
There was a attempt of such a thing in 1990's between Baltic governments and Boris Yeltsin right after USSR collapsed
It didnt lead anymore, because frankly Russia didn't want it to lead anywhere, they didnt even want to remove their military bases from Baltic states until Americans straight up threaten them with economic embargo if they don't. There cant be a ''conversation'' if one side is not interested in any sort of compromise , its just naive
Its been an official and standard policy of Finnish state since its very creation more than 100 years ago (it has never been canceled since then)
So for most Finns it's just ''normal'' part of life and how it should be and how it always has been
In fact a lot of countries in this region (except mine lol, Latvia) have military conscription (Finland, Estonia also since creation of their state, Sweden, Norway, Lithuania too)
because, you know, Russia is right there and its such a ''good'' and ''friendly'' neighbor
There are even talks in Latvia now that maybe we should restart it back again, because we also had military conscription until 2007 when it was deemed unnecessary due to NATO membership

There was a news story about this and at the and no one really knew why this number is so high and where it comes from
Poverty and alcohol
[Poverty] is very prevelant in Latvia, I speak from life experiences
And i knoe you are 100% bullshitting if you say you dont know anyone that is poor
Every single person in my village lived with what is called extreme material deficiency, and some of them couldnt even feed themselves without borrowing money
[Map] which points out Latvia is a hub for Russian organised crime into Europe
When it comes to minimum wage adjusted for prices in a given country(PPS), Latvia is at the bottom of the EU, so if you say there is not a lot of poverty in Latvia that is a complete and utter lie
[Proof for you, who] in denial]
Well maybe you grew up lucky not seeing poverty but trust me my friend poverty is much more common than wealth here, most people i know lived very poor since im from the countryside in Zemgale
Latvia is indeed one of the major Russian crime hubs outside of Russia, the mafia is still prevelant hete, murders happen
You know that Latvians and Russians often have a natural hatred between them, not me personally but most of my family hates Russians for example
London is literally the 1 place in the UK that is safer than Latvia, every other part of the UK is objectively much safer than Latvia
My house had been broken into a few times in Latvia, while living in a pretty safe area for Latvian standards, if you left your bike outside a store, or forgot your phone or something it is very likely they will get robbed, while in the Uk you dont have to really worry about this
Oh and my neighbour in Latvia was a convincted rapist and murderer, and not just for one case and he only got 15 years in prison and now freely walks my town and its pretty normal, I havent met anyone in the UK who has done more than petty crime
Source: Lived most of my life in the countryside of Zemgale, some in the outskirts of Riga and now in the UK for a few years
Ah I love getting downvoted for pointing out this man is clearly in denial about the state of Latvia, cause it clearly has poverty everywhere, and crime, and racism against Russians(and vice versa for Latvians)

>Latvia is such a pain though and it really slows you down
There’s like one road, overtaking is tricky, and it’s lined with cops on the lookout for speeding tourists
By 2040 there will be 130 km/h autobahn from Lithuania's border to Estonias
Its 1200 km of autobahns
Highway here in Latvia is some road with 90 km/h limit
Ok I fucked up little bit
By 2040 there will be 1200 km of autobahns across all of Latvia
Highways - 90km/h limit
Autobahn - 130 km/h limit
In Latvia
I do miss Lats mainly because of sentimental values from growing up with them
But at the same time having Euro is so much more convenient
My only downside is services got more expensive immediately after moving from LVL to EUR despite the government promising it won't be happening
Latvia doesn't have eyes, or it's just too late and I can't see
We have the same in Latvia
Each person can chop 1 tree for free
Is there an app for it or what
In Latvia anyone can chop down a singe tree for their home, if it's a state owned firest
Haven't heard that anyone would chop a bunch and go selling, besides, if you want to sell, you probably mustdeclare the origin
> You don't need any apps when you have Lembergs and Saskaņā to tell you how great things are
latvijas valsts meži has an app
Yeah well Lembergs is not in a good situation now and Saskaņā-we'll see
I have never read any of the "Fall of Numeror" books nor have managed to watch any of the movies to the end
Yes forests are total fault for this map
Not only Scandinavian, Baltic and Belarus forests are absent, but also there are not forests in the mountains of Carpats, Balkans and Caucasus
Russian TV Zvezda (former Soviet army TV channel) is so notorious for its false narrative, that it may be regarded as specializing in pure fiction
[Here on YouTube you can see a short video] highlighting some absurd claims in regards of a particular propaganda broadcast related to Latvia some years ago
It is in Russian, but has English subtitles on CC
The shamelessness of these evil clowns of the false Russian propaganda is astonishing
They went even as far as to claim that [the Latvian citizens murdered by Soviet secret police] after invasion of 1940 were actually victims of "Fascists".
I wonder if people who produce lies so cynical are mentally healthy
I guess that is just not possible
in Soviet Russia
you are always the Fashist
> since this is the original false flag that gave them the casus belli
Russians were doing a lot of strange things on their borders
In Latvia they [crossed the border just few days before invasion of 1940 and murdered some border guards and their family members] without any obvious reason
Unless intimidation was their reason
well surely if someone tries to resist peaceful and prefect Soviet union, they must be some kind of fahists sympathizers, there's just no other way someone with do such a thing  /s
STOP BEING FRIENDS WITH LATVIA and
Finland
and everyone else
because that's making us scared
Hey now
The plan was to quickly conquer tiny Russia and to use it's vast resources and huge army to fight against the Germans
Nobody in their right mind would pass such an opportunity
So much land, resources and military just sitting there, up for grabs

It doesn't show that yet, apparently we need to wait on the Council to vote
Does this mean cheaper PlayStations in the EU
In Latvia there are clases with 30 people and some with 10 in the same city
This is slightly misleading
In cities, average class size would be around 20-23, but we still have a lot of small rural schools (a vestige from soviet times), they bring the number down, since they barely can get a single class filled with 8-12 children

Lastly what does Latvia and what does being Latvian mean to you personally
answers to that will differ so widely from person to person that it's almost meaningless to ask
As cynical as it may seem I felt very similar
So much shit to fix it is pretty ridiculous to so often go in this festive state
Country actually feels broken beyond repairs

It is amazing how 1 person is destroying more than half a century long relationships between countries
And this is petty, but I almost would want for EU to start threatening USA with our own import taxes from USA, because they aren't building/creating it here
But that wouldn't be fair to the majority of the people who didn't want him
But USA really needs to check itself in a mirror and understand how did they manage to get a racist kid as the Free World leader
As long as you won't take UK and USA mantle of who can trumph who(no pun intended ), and do something stupid, like a Le Pen, we will be fine, hopefully
He is the next POTUS of course it is a big deal, he isn't some average Joe from the street, a person can't get to his position, unless majority of people want him there(not this time by a majority, but by an old system), so it wouldn't be incorrect for me to listen to him and be amazed, what stupid shit he thinks of today
And he didn't supposedly told just this time, but several times about these topics the same rhetoric
Well the Iraq invasion was sketchy at best
If the information would have been correct about WMD, then USA would see you as a friend who didn't believe him, and left him to fend for himself
Even if Germany would reduce their tax to the same as USA, you still couldn't import any vehicle made in USA
Because USA manufactured cars don't reach the minimum level of CO2 emissions, liter of fuel per 100 km, and overall they are to clunky for everyday use
That is why USA manufacturers have specific factories in EU, where you make editions of some models, which are compatible with the regulations
And guess what ? those cars don't have to pay import tax
Amen
Corruption and greed is a powerful enemy
You either die as a hero, or live long enough to become the villain
This I think is a great quote for the situation in USA right now
They are planning to team up with russia, a +- working health care system being trashed and being replaced by bigly words, racism, sexism, is going to be on a huge rise, + the incompetence of the police force there is amazing, religion fanatism still, for example abortion bans, even thought the republicans, pro-life don't give a shit about the kid when it is born, and overall bad education system has made all this shit possible

Honestly, with how crap my uni experience was, and how crap most of my friends uni experience has been, I'm not even mad at Latvia being behind Lithuania and Estonia
So many useless degrees, or ones that you do just to get the paper saying you did them, not because of the knowledge you gain

German is an official language there so it makes perfect sense
Way too high
Why
Yeah - this is why it's \~30% not 80-90+%.
Sounds about right to me
Similar to Italy, Romania, Portugal
Also - you mentioned Germany
When I was in Germany - I visited a cinema in Berlin
And the movie was in English
I expected German subtitles, but there weren't any
In my country all movies have subtitles in Latvian and Russian
But in some parts of Germany - it's apparently not necessary - why
I remember - that Cinema was in Sony Center Berlin
Maybe that's an anomaly, but apparently it can stay profitable even without dubbing or subtitling movies
The cinema was full of people when I was there
America's on the wrong side /s
Not sure about the competition but these are the prices in Latvia from the most well-known company [screenshot] .

Yes, but why build an aqueduct
Why not just dig a canal, which to me sounds a lot cheaper

8 degrees cause I’m so used to the cold weather that I’d die of heatstroke
Ive had up to 40 degrees in my yard but i guess we keep our recieds low to not harm other countries or something
I would be cooking if I would be outside and it is like 40°C or more and we are in countryside so cooling isn't the best, only ones that come up to mind are: we have 2 fans, I can go swimming or just cool off with that ¿thing what makes water to mist
Maybe they could call it Greenland
I suppose it is ever more shadowy organizations controlling the leaders of the previous organizations
I see no other way it could go if we follow this track of reasoning
The problem is that you can assert literally anything, as you do, and since you are asserting that there are specific organizations having specific influence I'm extrapolating to the only plausible conclusion
That saif organizations too have leaders that in turn need to keep their supporters loyal and would inevitably have to to turn to yet further organizations
Countries and their leaders are just another set of organizations so whatever applies to them applies down the line
In real world is often subtler than that, *influence* is easier and often more cost effective than some form of bribery and there's a myriad of ways to achieve that
Influence not the one way road you describe, it runs both ways and spans the world in an entanglement of both personal and organizational contacts
The notion that a leader is given a turnkey position with no say in it is so simplistic to be almost naive
They will bring their personal network, gain some of the network of their predecestor and the process will strengthen some of those connections and weaken others
The end result might be essentially the same, it may be changed a little or it may also result in significant change, for better or worse, down the line as that mess plays itself out
This, of course, applies to all of us
It's just that influencial people tend to have ties with other influencial people, meaning that politicians, almost invariably will not be strongly influenced by any given voter not on that list
Money too is both the game of influencial people as well as political campaigns
It's hardly surprising that is a significant part if the game
Nonetheless people are people, not economic automatons, so social and factual influence (NGOs, scientists, celebrities, etc
) also matters a great deal
TL;DR: It's not a figure head thing, start by avoiding politicians who only travel in circles you find questionable
Trump being a prime example of how it plays out when no one with any sense has any influence on a politician with no clue about anything
What on earth

* Māris is poor and can afford to eat only cabbage
* Statistically they both are well off eating meat filled cabbage rolls (Kāpostu Tīteņi)
There of course is a better version of the story which includes wives of a village :)
As someone who has emigrated from Latvia to Netherlands, Norway and to C.America, would you believe me when I say that in a lot of cases, in poorer countries food and basics are actually more expensive than rich countries
Whats the other version :D

Also important to note that Latvia turns 100 next year
Most of Latvia's renewable energy comes from hydroelectric dams
So the wind turbines and solar panels may be a bit misleading

It's mostly due to hydropower though
One of the most beautiful riverside landscapes was destroyed and went underwater to power the expansion of the capital with ugly soviet block buildings for foreign soviet workers to live in under the USSR

Despite your positive comment, most Latvians actually consider us the  least improved country of the 3 Baltic states
We are always just below Lithuania's ratings and way below Estonia's.
There are few upsides, tho
So its not that bad after all
Latvians are still Latvians even if they're living in London, Dublin, or Stockholm
Cheers mate
Dude 1
70 rate means we are dying out even without emigration
While we sell Estonians cheap booze, we go to Lithuania and buy cheap(er) food, clothing and even cars
So that pretty much evens out
They buy from us building materials, but as far as I know that is definitely not that widespread
Maybe some Lithuanian redditor can tell us more
More of these kind of photos
Latvian "red's" were at the center of the Russian Civil War and took up various positions of power in the USSR afterwards
* Jukums Vācietis was the [first ever commander of the Red Army]
* Jēkabs Peterss actually [founded the VChK aka
"cheka" along with Felix Dzerzinsky] and served as deputy chairman there
* Pēteris Ķuzis was [the head of the GRU from 1920 to 1935
] He got there due to being "recognized by his superiors for his work in pursuing, arresting, and liquidating Russian sailors after the Bolshevik suppression of the Kronstadt rebellion in March 1921".
* Jānis Rudzutaks was a [member of the Politburo] and was thought to be one of the candidates for Chairmanship
* Pēteris Stučka was a staunch communist, and [a member of Lenin's internal circle] and was interned in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis after his death in 1932
* Jēkabs Alksnis was the [commander of the Red Army Air Forces from 1931 to 1937]
* Mārtiņš Lācis was a staunch communist, [a member of the "cheka"] among other things and thought up this "wonderful" bit:
> "We are not fighting against single individuals
We are exterminating the bourgeoisie as a class
Do not look in materials you have gathered for evidence that a suspect acted or spoke against the Soviet authorities
The first question you should ask him is what class he belongs to, what is his origin, education, profession
These questions should determine his fate
This is the essence of the Red Terror
* Roberts Ēķis was instrumental in [the repression of "kulaks in Siberia]
There is an old wives tale that at one point Latvian was spoken so much in the Kremlin, that Stalin had to issue an order that only Russian is to be spoken in the Kremlin
Not really sure about this bit, though the NKVD did carry out [the Latvian Operation] that "liquidated" Latvians in the political and cultural sphere in Russia, including almost all of the people named above
holy fuck
They were kinda neutral as in they worked both sides, like deporting refugees back to the Soviet Union and its controlled territories where they were promptly disposed of
Mainly three reasons:
* most land in Latvia back then was owned by [Baltic German nobles] and Latvians were used as labor
A promise of "workers freed from chains" resonated quite well
* the territory of Latvia was ravaged during WW1, people had no food, no medicine and no infrastructure
Germany was the aggressor so the Bolsheviks had an easy time promising starving soldiers ownership of land and riches
* Lenin promised the riflemen an independent Latvia
In the process of the war a substantial number of Latvian riflemen retreated along with the Russian 12th Army, after the [German offensive against Riga in 1917] later, following further German offensives in 1918, retreating from the territory of Latvia completely
In Russia, they announced their allegiance to the Bolsheviks and were from then on known as the ["Red Latvian riflemen"]
Afterwards, Lenin did kinda come through on his promise, though, obviously on [his own terms] even though the Republic of Latvia (modern Latvia) had already been founded in Riga
The conflict between the Republic of Latvia (Latvia) and the Latvian Socialist Soviet Republic is known as the [Latvian War of Independence] and culminated in the defeat of the joint Red Latvian Riflemen/Soviet forces at the Battle of Daugavpils
Some 12,000 former red riflemen returned to Latvia post-war, on the promise of amnesty (upheld 100%), while many others didn't share their optimism (they were branded as traitors by the riflemen in Latvia) and elected to stay in Russia, using the contacts they made during the war and rising through the ranks
The people I mentioned in the post above mostly come from this group, along with other Bolshevik sympathizers and others simply running from the law and finding solace in a new place
This was the easiest to find in English:  but I've read about civilians being returned to USSR as well
The Swedish government did eventually apologize and they did offer a lot of help during the restoration of independence, almost as much as Finland did for Estonia, so we're not holding a grudge, it's just a dark spot in the past

My accent is as far from a Latvian one as it could be
I've had trouble speaking to Latvians in English, even if they're fluent in English, because my accent is so different
But if I spoke to a native English speaker outside of Latvia, they would not be able to tell I'm Latvian
My American friends have said that the only noticeable thing in my accent is that I force my t's and sometimes pronounce silent letters
But they also say I have a cool accent, so I'm happy about it

In Latvia, I'd need a special licence category to drive one, while in the US I could just hop in and go
The campers are surprisingly easy to drive though
Finally, not a culture shock per se, because this wouldn't be common in the EU either, just a very sweet moment in general - when I first arrived in Orlando, the Uber driver picking me up was this kinda old-ish Latino man who spent the whole 30 min drive to my Airbnb just completely jamming out to Mozart
He was tapping along to faster pieces, sometimes even conducting along; visibly moved by the slower pieces and just generally obviously loving it

- Ziedonis (The Flowering-One)
- Ilgonis (The One-Who-Yearns)
- Miervaldis (The Peace-Ruler)
- Laimnesis (The Luck-Bringer)
- Varis (The-One-Who-Can-Do-(It))
- Ilgvars (The One-Who-Can-Do-(It)-Long :D)
- Saulvedis (The Sun-Bringer)
- Jautris (The Fun-One)
- Spodris (The Clean-One)
- Spēkonis (The Strong-One)
- Koknesis (The Tree-Bringer)
- Druvvaldis (The Cornfield-Ruler)
For females:
- Saulcerīte ( The-One-Who-Hopes-For-Sun)
- Sniedze (The Snowy-One)
- Smaida (The Smiley-One)
- Skaidra (The Clear-One)
- Dzidra (The Clear-One) - yes, these are synonyms
- Jautrīte (The Fun-One)
- Veldze (Refreshment)
Historically, Latvia as an independent country is very young
The territory of Latvia has been under German, Polish, Swedish and Russian rule
The names u/FRAX1001 mentioned are of German origin (except 'Jurjāns')
The ones I mentioned are of definite Latvian/Baltic origin
There are also some old Scandinavian names to be found as well (like Ilmārs, Dagmāra)
So, to be accurate: There are many old names to be found in Latvia, which come from other cultures
But the traditional Latvian ones are, definitely, the most fun
But a lot of these names are still in common usage today
My neighbour is Dzidra
My family includes Ilgvars, Ilmārs, Skaidra
And Šarlote
Yes, some of them are still in use for sure
And still may be considered old-timey and old-fashionable
The 'translatable' Latvian ones are hardly used for people born in Post-Soviet era
I think it may have to do with the anti-Russian sentiment in the Soviet era that Latvians gave their child a name such as Ziedonis
To give that name today would mean the child would be teased at school
But the Germanic ones like Šarlote or Gabriēla are coming back
If you wish to have the really old, seldomly-used Latvian names, then, of course, these would be the pre-Christian ones like Namejs, Kaupo, Vetseke, Lokers etc
Edit: formatting
Are there really people in Britain with first name: Stevie-leigh, Anne-Marie, Bobbi-leigh, Carla-Mae, Demi-rose
They all sound American to me
Who knew
That doesn't really happen but I do forget a lot of words in Latvian and I have to translate them from English
The word that I somehow keep forgetting is "watermelon
" It just sounds so different in Latvian("arbūzs")
Sometimes I pronounce some Latvian words in the way I would read them in English
For example, there is a sign near my house with the word "banknote" on it
The word is same in both languages but pronounced differently, when I first saw it my brain kinda stopped for a second
It's also very hard to switch between languages
I would be talking to my American friends and I would tell them what a word is in Latvian but right after I use the Latvian word my brain just switches to Latvian
Often when I need to translate two words and use "and" in the middle, I accidentally use the Latvian word "un" for it
When I need to say an English word in a Latvian sentence, I always say it with a thick Latvian accent, and my brain doesn't really switch to English
It's weird lol
This doesn't happen to me probably because English is very different from Latvian but sometimes when I start to analyze my native language it seems very weird
the fourth point is really similar here
We had literally the same shit about Norway making the rounds about 3 or 4 years ago
It was quickly traced back to a Russian propaganda organization (no surprise there) but there are still believers holding out to this very day
This myth was quite prevalent something like 10-15 years ago in Latvia
It originated in Russia, supposedly because of a book written by some Russian woman that **supposedly** married a Norwegian and then had to run with her child when she realized how "sick" the Norwegian society is
She also claimed that boys get taught to dress like girls in school and all sorts of other crap
The book has been translated into several different languages and published in most former Soviet block countries
Personally I don't buy it and I think it's deliberate propaganda smear piece, especially judging by how wide it's spread
It's not because of some widespread animosity against Norway, the story was spun by Russian propagandists because there was a Russian family in Norway where children were taken away by the Norwegian CPS, and as a matter of policy, the Norwegians couldn't and wouldn't comment anything on the case (to protect the children and their privacy
) This, however, let the enraged parents come up with the wildest claims and no one could say anything to disprove it
Then the Russian media latched on to it, the troll farms saw an easy opportunity for spreading chaos, and the rest is history
I know that because they did exactly the same over here:
One politician, when the epidemic started here continued to go to work and break quarantine, it later turned out that he had COVID-19 and that he lied to the doctors and everybody else about being abroad and meeting infected people
I can't, he's just special in that way, he's done many other stupid things
Iceland is my favorite country so I never forget that
Yes, Hatari were amazing and that is exactly how I started learning more about Iceland and it became my favorite country
I read the comments but I rarely see any Latvian comments
Yep
But a couple years ago I came across some parody organization - Radi-Aid, where Africans crowdsoursing and sending radiators and heaters over to Norway to help these people make it through cold and dark winter
They actually made several pretty good produced videos, including choir songs in support of people Nothern Europe
I think it's quite smart answer to all this huge African poverty nonsense, but unfortunately not symmetrical in terms of the volume
Russia is quite huge
So, surely, as in almost any country, especially big and diverse, there are people who live in poverty and difference in economical climate may vary from region to region
Haha, I'd love to see
Jaj, danke
Isn’t it hi-purr-bowley
Check out the Bristol stool chart
It’s worth it
I thought cottaging was gay dogging ?  Maybe I’m doing it wrong
Shtstool
Sounds about right
Latvia used to have extreme anti-German sentiment in the interwar period, due to the extreme damage caused by Germans invading, but after WW2 and the Soviet occupation, Latvians for the most part just kind of guided our anti-German sentiment towards the Russians, so now Latvia has quite a bit of anti-Russia sentiment
You and me both
Quite often
My native is Russian, but also speaking Latvian because
Because state language, duh
When I was dating a guy who is also Russian, quite soon I inderstood that I cannot remember basic words in Russian and it is a bit hard to communicate in my native language
This always gets me when talking about mechanical stuff
I feel like I know only 20% of all of the terms and lingo in my native language (Latvian), also doesn't help that the older guys adopted the Russian terms for stuff
For example, take the English word "ratchet", in Latvian it's "sprūdrata atslēga" and the guys in the workshop use the Russian word "varatok".
This is a bit tricky question
Technically we have some linguistic autonomy at least at the school level - there are attempts to abolish education in Russian, but the government has tried to do that already 20 years ago
We simply don't have human resources (not enough of qualified teachers who know how to work with bilingual system)
There is quite big Russian-speaking population, so among ourselves we use Russian
But on govermental and higher-education level sometimes I feel like Russian is non-existent
Like, University of Latvia (one of main universities) e-studies page has Latvian, English and Spanish (wtf
) versions
But no Russian
But to be fair, in universities majority of us has to stick to English materials
Because there are not enough translated resources
We have some political pro-Russian parties, but one of them is just meh, would never vote for them, and another one always turned out to be in opposition despite gathering the biggest amount of voice
I feel that as a citizen I don't have voting rights if I don't vote for 'correct' political power that states that Latvia is only for ethnic Latvians
Which is hilarious because this land never was mono-ethnic
I'd say Russian is more available in commercial sector
Job ads quite often require knowledge of Russian
Then we had a funny scandal because of that 1-2 years ago with implication that no one has the right to demand knowledge of Russian for a job
That person had no issue with English though
I could drag on and on, but basically this is the result of post-Soviet Latvian goverment denying local Russian community citizenship which was promised in turn for supporting separation from USSR
We still have non-citizens here who refuse to take naturalization exam or learn the language properly
And I get them, because the heck
They risked their lives during barricades alongside with ethnic Latvians
Don't get me wrong, I rarely have problems just because I'm Russian in daily life, but on political level sometimes I feel like a mudblood in Slitherin
IT here, our anglo-latvo-russo (with some Finnish and Swedish additions) technical language is something to behold
Well, with citizenship things are finally changing - from 2020 children of non-citizens will have Latvian citizenship by default
I think European Union finally started to pay attention to this issue
And thanks for pointing out that there is an issue with political representation in general
A bit hard to see it in overall context when it used to be tied to ethnical stuff all the time
Don't drink and drive
No licence for 5 years
4000 euro penalty
Confiscation of the car
Mandatory medical checkup s. New license again from 0
- test etc
Don't piss on monuments
Long story short
Just don't do it
For a while i thought Baden and Bavaria was the same place haha
>Thinking we are Russians
As a Latvian, I get you perfectly and can feel your pain
I feel like to a lot of non-European people Europe is England, France, Italy/Spain and Russia (+Scandinavia, if you're advanced), take it or leave it
As a kid I used to really respect this, however lately I've been fed up with old ladies that will take a seat on a packed bus and use the seat next to them to put their 100 grocery bags on, pester you about giving up your seat (verbally or by standing and staring at you) even though there are a ton of free seats, or those who can stand fine yet will use their age as an excuse to not give up their seat to someone younger who'd have objectively harder time standing due to obvious medical injury/condition
From now on I only get up if the bus is completely full and the person really looks like they have difficulty standing
hi neighbor
it's very similar here :)
same thing here
You English are cheeky cunts
I've never considered Italy and Spain to be interchangable
I think they have vastly different cultures
I meant the "/" as in some non-euro people choose to see Spain, some Italy when it comes to  what they consider the typical "sunny vacation destination" European countries
Not sure how to word it correctly
Sorry if I offended anyone :(
I know old people like that
I have never met your grandpa and *I* can tell you at least 10 reasons why *his life* was better in communism
Number one - he was young and healthy, and so on
That doesn't mean it was good, or it's better in general
It's a safety thing these days, so one more excuse for that
Well, we were the ones oppressed, so not really awkward from my side
Estonian police has come up with new way to punish drivers going a speed limit
The Estonian police has come up new way to punish drivers who break the speed limit on the highway
They call it "Stop and calm down" Basically they get a choice either pay the usual fine or just stand at the side of the road for some time
Depending on how severe the speed the driver was going over the limit the drivers might have stand at the side of the road from 30 minutes up to an hour
What do you think
Do think this might help against speeding drivers
When Brooklyn 99 tried to have a guy speak [Latvian ] they butchered it real bad, the security guy at least could be understood, but it seems like he really tried to sound like a stereotypical Russian, which Latvian sounds nothing alike
But when the cop speaks Latvian, I could not even understand what he was saying most of the time
They made the typical mistake of assuming that Eastern Europe = Russian
Not a film, but a tv show
"Brooklyn Nine-Nine" used Latvian
I've never seen the show, all I've seen of it is just this [scene] in which they speak Latvian
I can't understand 99% of what they are saying, the translations and pronunciations are all wrong
We have articles in major news outlets even upon a throwaway mention of our country
A named character, and especially one with lines is front page news
First of all, what mountans
Highest point in this contrie isnt even 300m high
Secondly, no
We dont greet strangers
If somebody says hi to you, you assume they know you somehow and then spend the rest of the day thinking, who they were
As we don't have any mountains in my country, I'd say no
we don't have mountains but on trails we just smile awkwardly and nod
Priecīgus Ziemassvētkus un laimīgu Jauno Gadu
Priecīgus Ziemassvētkus
What‘s funny is I’ve noticed that most people that say that the EU is trash, done for, and practically on the brink of destruction are almost always from either a Balkan country, or Central European Slavic country
I’m honestly curious about why they seem to think this
I can barely understand the latgallian dialect from the eastern part of the country (some of them consider it its own language)
In Latvia they say that one will end up digging trenches
umm
:D why do you think so
i think the profession is cut out to be filled by robots and machines only in no time
I have to admit to becoming a terribly horrible insanely poorly badly sucking trench digger as I have unsurprisingly little strength in my arms for someone who works at the computer and
draws
I'm elevating pencils, not shovels xd
But that's not meant in a classist way, it's more of a "lol this dude got saggy triceps lmao"
Yeah
anyway, moving on
judging by how offended people get these days a potential war would never ever never ever never ever
never stop because the dynamic these days is overly emotional to which I say the 5 sacred Gs: good god, get a grip girl
We have potatoes
That Latvians are not the same people as Russians
I'm from Latvia and our country is super flat, no mountains at all and the highest point is 312 m above water which we also call "mountain" in out language
Usually any other country in Europe beside Baltic have mountains, so it was unbelievable for them
After some time I was hiking in my country along beautiful river in our national park Gauja, sent them some photos and they still asked me WHY YOU DIDN'T TAKE PHOTOS WITH MOUNTAINS
Well,
We do, but the "latvia no have potat such is life" jokes have gotten to the point where _multiple_ people i've spoken to have genuinely asked me "do you guys have potatoes there
European Las Vegas ? Fuck no
What even is American Las Vegas for
Casinos are a mystery, who the fuck wants to go there
Cesspit including those
No, this year has kinda made want to become an ecofascist unironically
First day that it was hot as hell was a confusing one
I looked at the weather forecast for that day and it said 24°C. Nothing special
Then when it reached 24°C the forecast said it would be 25°C. And it repeated that all the way until 30°C.
Now I just go swimming every day, but the water is getting warmer too
It rains quite often, so that's cool
I'm really not built for anything above 23°C, I hardly got through 21°C in the past normal summers
I also moved into a new flat recently
This flat actually has an AC, which I didn't want to use because I thought it seemed useless after the cold spring we had this year
Now I use it anyway, I just need to get myself an air humidifier because my skin is drying out from the AC dehumidifying the house
With a big appetite for eating other Latvians without salt
How did you end up getting it
Still European
Don't want to be mistaken for a yank
Outer parts of Riga, just filled with commie block bulidings
For me it looked kind of average when I stayed there
Atleast the landscape around it made the town look nice
Chapter 1
General provisions
Latvia is an independent democratic republic
The sovereignty of the Latvian state belongs to the Latvian nation
The territory of the Latvian state, as set by international treaties, consists of Vidzeme (not sure the English name, literally midland), Latgale (Lettigallia), Kurzeme (Courland), Zemgale (Semigallia)
The state language in the Latvian Republic is Latvian
The flag of Latvia is red with a white dash
So fuck the 30% Russians living in Latvia, I suppose
Article 1
Latvia is an independent democratic republic
Latvia is an independent democratic republic
The sovereign power of the State of Latvia is vested in the
people of Latvia
The territory of the State of Latvia, within the borders
established by international agreements, consists of Vidzeme,
Latgale, Kurzeme and Zemgale
The Latvian language is the official language in the Republic of
Latvia
The national
flag of Latvia shall be red with a band of
white
More precise, from the [official translation] (pdf)
Kinda funny, since this constitution was applied in 1922 but in 1934 we became a dictatorship
Might be because Canadian and Australian monarchies are protestant ones, with the monarch having ultimate sovereignty over the church, whereas Spain is Catholic, the church's sovereignty is in Vatican
They are dispersed, though not nearly evenly
A lot more of them East than West
The second biggest city, Daugavpils, I think is majority Russian speaking
I don't think they're a majority on any regional level though
Didn't know there was an official translation, thanks
It uses the word "tauta", which has ethnic and linguistic connotations
It's a bit hidden
It specifically says "the nation of Latvia" and has lawyers fawning over it for such an enlightened, all-inclusive thinking for 1920s, when there weren't 25% Russians living in Latvia
As is ours, it was suspended in '34 and reinstated in '90 partially and '93 fully
Our authoritarian didn't change the constitution of 1922, unlike our neighbours in Estonia and Lithuania
The bit about Latvian being the exclusive language doesn't help either
They created new ones I think when the union fell
Ethnicity is about culture, it's usually the same as parents' and people are not keen to change it, but there's nothing preventing a child of Russians growing up or even living long in Latvian enviroment to fully adopt Latvian culture (also OP doesn't know what they're talking about, you were absolutely right that it talks about  Latvian nationals, not ethnicity)
I know why, I just wish we were above such silly things
Look to your Northern neighbours, 5% of Finland speaks Swedish, for very similar reasons why there's Russians in the Baltics, and it's a recognised official language
Imperialism is imperialism, doesn't much matter if it's 300 years or 800 years
I was a little kid in Mauritius next to a store once and I was like a typical Latvian kid, my skin was light, bright blue eyes and long, thick blond hair
So, a random guy come up to me and strocked my head bc he had never seen a white kid with blond hair in his life
You get what you pay for
A couple months ago I was getting the bus from Brazil to Argentina, and right before the border a Russian couple get on
They're in the middle of a huge arguments where she is basically acting like an entitled spoiled bitch complaining about everything, the bus, her boyfriend, their holiday, their luggage, the other people on the bus, and he's just apologising for it and hoping that she'll stop
Now the way the border bus works, is that locals don't need a passport to cross so foreigners have to get out, get stamped, and wait for the next bus, at both checkpoints
This is fine with us, and the two older German guys also on the bus
They were super friendly, and obviously we were talking in English with them
This wasn't fine with entitled Russian girl who still didn't seem to realise she's in South America, not Russia
She continues to complain about her ridiculously oversized luggage, about how her boyfriend is stranding her in some shithole in nowhere, that no one around them even speaks Russian so she can't even ask for help because we're all too stupid to understand Russian
This goes on for the whole wait for buses, both times, and we eventually get to the town in Argentina with her still acting the drama queen ranting away in Russian
Of course, then she starts a big rant that she's not walking across town to the hotel with her stupidly big bag, her boyfriend either needs to find someone to carry it or arrange a taxi or something
He's trying to finally calm her down as the rest of us get off the bus, and we can't take it anymore
I look up where their hotel is on our map, and walk over with my girlfriend who proceeds to explain to them, in Russian, that their hotel isn't too far to walk and give them directions
The look on her face when she finally shut up, for the first time since boarding the bus, and realised that we had understood everything she was saying, was priceless
This is the way
Latgale, it is the poorest region in the baltics(as far as I know) and one of the poorest in all of the EU's Eastern countries, highest unemployment in Latvia, often disregarded by tourists while having some beautiful sights
There are also plenty of villages completely abandoned, while that is all over the country, Latgale is noticeably more abandoned
Maybe I have a soft spot for the region cause I'm half Latgalian and visit every year
I'm not sure if other languages have this but as far as I know, I haven't seen one besides Lithuanian maybe, but there are only 6 endings and one exception, nouns only have two genders, so most male nouns end with "s" and most female with "a" or "e" . My foreign friends always laugh about how they can take any word, add an "s" and now they sound Latvian
Some people here tend to do that in Latvian too, very rarely though
I think the mild discomfort is a small price to pay for the long, warm evenings in summer and light mornings in winter
The difference is very important the further north you go
Funny, I have the exact same argument but with summer time and how the extra light in the evenings would be beneficial for people coming from work
It's really depressing in the winter when you go to work, it's still dark, go home, it's dark already and you've spent the whole daytime working for the man
Really makes you feel exploited, too
Doesn't matter what time that's already the case as is
We made cake for [Estonia] [Finland] and [Lithuania] on their respective 100-year independence anniversaries
We are the country that gives the most gifts to other people
Latvia is the smallest colonial power in the history of the World
Well it depends on each person, I always refer to Latvia as Eastern Europe because I have noticed it makes more sense to group us with EE countries for economic, cultural, linguistic, historical reasons and so on
Estonia is like 50/50 for me I would call it both
Both as in Eastern and Northern Europe
I’m bad at being a Latvian: I can’t sing, I don’t tend to the cemetery, my room is not laid out according to *āderes* but I do believe that *caurvējš* can get you sick
Any other stereotypes
Brooklyn Nine-Nine
Season 4, Episode 10 - Captain Latvia
There is no Captain Latvia toy in real life and they talk about Latvia like it’s a dump full of people too poor to do anything
Actually any time B99 mentions Latvia, I want to cringe
Nikolaj isn’t even a Latvian name, at least not the way Boyle insists of pronouncing it
Well Latvia is barely mentioned in media but when it is its just Soviet Russia but they can make stuff up or just funny foreigner
Same about the Macgyver episode set in Latvia
It was ridiculous, I laughed all the way through
They got a few names and translations right, better than some other shows, but that's it
Nothing looked even close to Latvia and those events wouldn't even be possible here hahaha
There was some Russian newspaper back a few months ago claiming COVID was developed by the EU in Latvia in order to kill off the ageing population of Italy, or something like that
I can't remember the details, but it was wild
I am imagining a great empire, stretching from Brussels to Vladivostok; Baku to Murmansk, of Slavic peoples
Thousands upon thousands of miles of interlinking Adidas stripes, always an apartment building to squat outside drinking Tyskie or a local equivalent, blasting Russian hip-hop at full volume
Who knows
Maybe we're super suspicious people, or maybe Kremlin is still trying to recruit our (pretty big) Russian population
There are some obtuse people who would like us to reconquer Trinidad and Tobago, and The Gambia
Never mind that 1) we never conquered anything, just bought them; 2) it was a German vassal state to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth that was about a quarter of our country; 3) it was about a decade or two in the 17th century; 4) we've ourselves have been in a similar situation in our own land
Idiots are everywhere
We, Latvians, joke about taking back Ruhnu island back from Estonia all the time
It was our only island and Estonia already has so many
There are some Latvian people (and maybe Lithuanian) who say that Moscow is ours because some extinct Eastern Baltic tribes conquered it from the local Slavs
Ass Nazis in latvian means “sharp knife”
Ass=sharp
Nazis=Knife
In Latvian "ass" means sharp or spicy
Wonder what foreigners think when they can get an "ass" kebab
"Maukas lohi" in Finnish means "tasty salmon", in Latvian "Slut loser" lmao
France, anywhere coastal, I don't think I could live without the sea
Oddly one of the main countries I would like to move to is Croatia, which to you might seem crazy because you are Croatian, but It's so Slavic, yet so beautiful in terms of nature, amazing roads, cool people and so on
Croatia is probably my favorite country from everywhere I've traveled to(which isn't a lot of places but still)
Back when I was in college in Finland I was walking home and a group of Russian tourists approached me and tried to ask me for directions in broken English mixed with Russian words
They were fairly surprised when I answered them in Russian
They asked what I was doing and how I liked it in Finland, and then moved on
To be equally fair, all driving license holders should pass test like once in 10 years
-20°C. At that point it feels like your face is being stung by little tiny needles

I feel that since Latvia has acquired Independence, the key people and parties in the Parliament remained the same
Over time parties changed names and whatnot, but the agenda is always the same
I always vote with the hope of changing that and bringing younger blood into the mix
More often than not for liberals
It's a shame, that they never get much votes
Is it true, that Putin gets a lot of legit votes from seniors, who are used to seeing genseks in power for decades
Saskaņa un ZZS varbūt te ir 30 gadus, par JKP, KPV un citām varētu pastrīdēties
People, who were involved with the Communists are disliked here, so we don't have them in the open
But
Some time ago there were a lot of old school people in politics, of whom you could find out, that they were actually in politics during the Soviet times as well
But they are such low people, that you know they are in politics for being important and for some sort of power, rather than due to their ideological beliefs
That kind of people, which would go into it regardless of the political situation in the country, and would loudly express their support for the dominant political force
In Latvia, when people think we speak Russian
I mean many Latvians (but not all by any means) can speak Russian, sure, but the Latvian language is a completely different language (non-Slavic Indo European) that doesn’t even use the same alphabet as Russian
Well it makes me crazy anyway
I learned this here 5min ago and I ***cannot wait*** to use this to tease local Russians
You seem to have a chip on shoulder regarding English
Is this because of history book
But if he is wrong, why say that makes him an Englishman
As if that was most derogatory thing
Soon Ireland will accept its rightful and welcome place back in the bosom of the UK
I've NEVER seen a woman sunbathe topless
To be honest, I don't think it's even legal to be naked in public
I’m also a former exchange student (went to Germany, too) and I also have worked later for an organisation that does exchange programs
I didn’t google my host family’s name, too, and I am sure they didn’t google me as well (although my full name is unkommon and google doesn’t offer much results about me either)
I’m also not used to google other people
I had to fill a questionnare before my exchange where I had to state everything about me like hobbies, school and medical stuff, so my host family would know something about me and the host family had to do the same, people from the organization went to their home to check whether they actually can host exchange students, so I was sure that everything will be alright
Also I was paying for all of that, therefore I thought I have no reasons to google them
If they googled me, then I would expect them to not tell that to me
That is kinda weird
After we matched, we followed each other on social media anyways
It is extremely rude and they had no right to do that especially when you were with guests
This is not normal
I think that could be a good reason to switch host families
I as a Latvian actually use some old English words like shall, hath, thou etc
since they sound bit more better
Oh, when our Minister of Finance in the interview with Bluoomberg to question about crisis 2008 answered "Nothing Special" (1:30)
It's still a meme here
[Laimdota Straujuma] former Prime Minister of Latvia, speaking at the EPP convention
Came here to post this :D iconic
The Tsar wasn't the only russification enthusiast
The Soviets did it throughout the USSR, and Putin is doing it right now in Crimea
same for latvians
We call it “Jāņi”
My bad yes you are correct
Ah yes my bad
I really think that the holiday is the one i look most forward to
A Latvian, that doesn't have anything to complain about
I'm a Latvian who doesn't like fish and especially sprats
A Latvian who doesn't like sour cream
A Latvian that doesn’t eat rye bread
A Latvian that doesn't eat tasty tasty tasty potatoes
The Sun- Saule(language, female), Saule(mythology, goddess)
The Moon- Mēness(language, male), Mēness(mythology, god)
In mythology, the Moon is actually the Sun's husband
This wasn't in the question, but Earth in Latvian is "Zeme" which is female, and we have goddesses like "Zemes māte"(Earth's mother), "Vēju māte"(Winds' mother), "Jūras māte"(Sea's mother), "Meža māte"(Forest's mother) and "Veļu māte"(Souls' mother)
Saule is sun, which is female, and Mēness is the moon, which is male
Isnt it used for months
Baltic languages, especially Lithuanian, are supposedly some of the most archaic IE languages, retaining the most proto-indo-european features, and in both Latvian and Lithuanian the Sun is feminine and the Moon masculine
Same in our pagan mythology (pretty similar to Norse/Germanic) - the Sun is a major female goddess, the Moon is a somewhat lesser male deity
Is the English being cold really a stereotype
I would understand Finland, and the Baltic nations with that stereotype but not England
I'm not sure if it counts as in history, as he's still alive, but it's Alfrēds Rubiks, probably
Most Russian leaders in general
Well, they didn't say explicitly that it has to be a native or local, so I'd say Stalin
Not sure about the pronounciation, since I haven't really met many people who would speak it as a foreign language
But grammar I'd say is fucked, even most natives don't get everything right
**Grammar** \- Difficult for almost anyone (maybe except Lithuanians)
**Pronunciation** \- Most words have at least one "S" in them, which isn't hard, but the challenging part is the "š" (sh), "ķ" (kj) sounds
Try saying "*Visneiedomājamākais šaursliežu dzelzceļš*".
Overall there are a few cases of people learning the language to almost a native level
**Examples:**
* [American girl learned Latvian in almost a year] Starts at 1:14
* [German guy learned Latvian and a bit of Russian while living in Riga] (you can still tell he's german though)
* [Italian guy speaking fluent Latvian]
* [Canadian guy speaking perfect Latvian]
I would like my country to adopt remote work wherever reasonable
Totally agree
I've seen this said before and it's pretty illogical, if you think about it:
* They can allready and haven't
* This unties work from place
They might lower the salary, but offer it to the entire World, that could rather have the effect of evening out salaries across the World than decreasing availability of the work in richer countries
But it doesn't automatically mean that cheapest labour is always the main factor in hiring someone, you may also want job to be done well and such
* Working remotely doesn't cancel taxes and labour laws
Companies might have problems with lowering wages on one hand and moving to hire outside of their country on the other that they wouldn't want to bother with
* There are jobs that require knowing local language, culture and other things, but not necessarily sitting at a desk in an office
Reallistically companies for which it makes sense, like large multinationals might and likely allready have
For the rest there's plenty of other issues to deal with besides having employees come to office purely out of habit
UK, France and Estonia
Without their help Latvian independence war could've ended disastrous for Latvians
Shit  what happened later sucks, but things are as they are
It's important to keep in mind mistakes done in first half of 20th century so we don't repeat it again and, despite whole brexiting thing, temporary insanity in Poland etc, I think level of ties between European countries would make a  positive difference nowadays
Not in the list, but if a Lithuanian spoke really slowly, I think I could understand most of what they were saying
I feel very European, maybe because I was brought up in a very pro-Europe environment
But I honestly identify myself as a Latvian and equally a European
I have traveled all over Europe, met people, found friends, we are not that different
I've taken part in multiple Erasmus+ programmes and am fascinated by our individual and shared cultures, there is a lot to learn
All of the (US) Americans I've met
they appear to be like us, but there is this underlying thing that makes me wonder if we're from the same planet
I'm glad someone gave you a more comprehensive answer
For me, it's hard to describe
I've felt it during conversations
Like when you watch American series or films and you think "pfff people never talk like that in real life" but then it turns out that a lot of them do
I've always been surprised by the subjects they consider fitting for conversations with strangers, and how they think and talk about things
And, of course, the obvious things like education, healthcare, credit etc
Recently visited with bf from Finland and stayed for a month in several cities
It was definitely not as cheep (except Zagreb) as we expected, and, yes, we tried to avoid very touristy restaurants/shops
Felt like we were expected to spend a fortune just because we were "tourists". The nature and the coastline was still worth the money, tho
Estonia i gues
If I see a Lithuanian in here saying it's Poland or smth, I will be crying in my pillow tonight
We dont really like russians
We love our baltic brothers but we do have a friendly rivalry of who's country is better etc
If Lithuanians are like brothers then Estonians are like friendly rivals
Most country jokes here in Latvia either involve Russia (who frankly doesn’t give two shits about us), or Lithuania, the good old drunk Latvians with socks in their mouths who are in denial :)
We enjoy a bit of friendly rivalry with Estonia
Estonia has the highest "mountain"(more like a hill than a mountain) in the Baltic states
Our highest point was 312 metres above sea level, theirs was 318 metres
We built a tower on top of our hill to surpass the Estonians, but the tower was later demolished because of safety risks
It's pretty much become a joke that Estonia is always better than Latvia
When Estonia got covid-19, we still hadn't gotten it, Latvian Twitter was filled with "Estonia's ahead of us again
I think its the ruling system
Hmm really a hard question
Lithuania are bros and Estonians are our little slow bros
You and me both brother :(
Not liking is putting it mildly for many, but what it is indisputable is that Lithuanian sounds like drunk Latvian
Don’t forget to say that when we built the tower they built a slightly taller one, then we lengthened ours, then they, back and forth like that, until the aforementioned demolition
Also don’t forget our good old buddy Lithuania, weird weird Lithuania
But in a very friendly way, no matter where I would find a fellow from the Baltics, I would instantly feel a good connection
I might say that we're better (in reality Estonia is better), but that would be more of a joke, I still love yall
yes
Eeey ofc we do
Unbreak my
Say you rival us agaaiiiiin
I wanted to say hate, but hate is a strong word and i didnt want to offend anyone:D
We love you estonia
what about that island though
Shit
London, Paris, Frankfurt ... are places to work and live, but I can’t imagine are great to visit as a tourist
Zero interest in visiting Las Vegas or Dubai (although I have been to visit friends who live in Dubai, staying at their home)
Sometimes, you just want nice weather and scenery, but not culture or even other people, so a private villa with own pool and no near neighbours, but within a larger resort for ‘in-villa’ catering and bar service, can be quite nice
Doesn’t really matter which country you are in
Or go exploring, walk, cycle, hire car
Eat out, with the locals, but look for quieter restaurants or un-crowded beach bars
Sometimes lookup the best restaurants on TripAdvisor, start at #1 and go through the list, a different one each night
A real eye-opener on how to tell if TripAdvisor reviews are accurate or not
Don’t really like guided tours or group excursions
Can always google about places
Give anything that counts as ‘nightlife’ an extremely wide berth
I don't like living in Latvia and would like to move to Finland
I don't have a specific reason other than it is a clear upgrade on almost all parameters, plus I really like the culture and language
And nature
the politics and minimum wage are fucked up
especially for the minorities
The country is literally dying out
I feel bad for it
I’d say we are pretty well off, since we are sandwiched between two very friendly countries, get access to the sea, lots of forests and rivers, also pretty good for agriculture, and good mix of summer and winter seasons, so I’d say the geography is perfect
Wait
*looks at Russia*, nevermind
Pros: great sense of humor
Cons: not easy to get it out unless drunk and/or in a sauna
The difference is that Latvia remains Latvia, even if we have a large Russian minority
A third\*
Doesn't mean it's right to look down upon them and imply that Latvia is any lesser because of them
Yeah, one bastard somehow got inside my fifth floor apartment during the night and bit me
That's the first time ever since that has happened in this place
Left Latvia to study in a UK college because there are more job opportunities in the UK
I still love my country but sadly there just isn’t as many job opportunities as I would like and the government is quite corrupt ,and it just looks like they are milking the county for their own interest and don’t care about the people
I do visit my friends and family and make some dentist appointments there once a year
It's Kaka in Latvian :)
Niva still popular out in rural areas
I’ve got one !
It was popular no matter your or anybody else's opinion :D
This explains so much
Sometimes I feel like I would be much more fit somewhere else
I went to Copenhagen for a project and I felt like I belonged there with my host family more than I do at home
Still I love my home
I think for many young people from Latvia the answer would be yes, it's even worse for gay people since I'm pretty sure we're either top 3 or top 5 least lgbt friendly countries in Europe
Northern Europe knows the only real drinking is to get drunk eg UK, Germany, Finland
Southern Europe pretends they are too grown up for this eg Italy, Spain, Greece
But they sleep during the day and have 10 course meals really late at night, so they have their own problems
USA unhealthy attitudes to drink stems from their Puritanical times
Everyone can have guns and take heroin
But drinking more than one glass of red with dinner and you get funny looks
Fuck that
Generally South America is up for a good time and wowzers Mexico there is only one reason to invent tequila
Spanish adults are drunk at home not in the street
I don’t think the OP was particularly talking about only in the street
I'm still not used to the fact that now you can walk on the streets of Riga and hear languages that you are not able to understand (meaning, not Latvian, not Russian, not English)
Also feels realy weird when you order Bolt and you get a driver who won't speak any of those three languages
Never seen a religious billboard in my life
Maybe some charity ad that has a reference to some religious org in the footnote
In Latvia i have only seen one while driving thru the country which wasn’t even a real billboard it was a big ass rag with the text “Love jesus” or something like that
Maybe a few words of lithuanian and definitely not "easily".
None really
Most Latvians can understand a bit of Lithuanian, but the two languages aren't mutually intelligible
Then there's Latgalian, which a lot of people outside of Latgale claim is just a dialect and not a separate language but, even so, people from the rest of the country will only understand about 25% of it at most
As I've seen in Lithuania I saw a lot čeburekai stands
I was travelling through Siaulia, there's a lot of them
Living in Latvia, can confirm flags are everywhere, all the time
There are some days in Latvia where every household gotta display flag (yeah it's in constitution)
If you don't display you can get a fine
In Latvia is compulsory to own flag and fly it on official “flag days” which there are several per year
Flag days:
* 25 March (in mourning) — In memory of victims of communist genocide
* 1 May — Constitution Day, Labour Day
* 4 May — Restoration of Independence (1990)
* 14 June (in mourning) — In memory of victims of communist genocide
* 17 June (in mourning) — Beginning of the Soviet occupation in Latvia
* 4 July (in mourning) — In memory of victims of the Holocaust
* 11 November — Lāčplēsis Day
* 18 November — Independence Day (1918)
* First Sunday in December (in mourning) — In memory of victims of communist genocide
I notice in UK, Scottish and Welsh flag are often displayed and seen as friendly and patriotic
However English flag is only to be displayed by extremists
UK flag is seen as global brand, so begins to be disassociated with the actual nation state a little no ?
No, it's not
It is quite common here in Latvia
I only see the welsh flag on Rugby days
No they give you 40€ fine ( not large fine, but still ...)
In the first case, it would not be punished at all, since it is no longer illegal for private persons to not display the national flag on national holidays, and it is also not illegal to fly a foreign flag (to my knowledge)
The second case is an entirely different story
No, there would be like 1000€ fine, I really don't know all fines, but about 1000 euros I have heard so
Oh god, same
The worst part is that most people think that cynicism equals intelligence - "look at me I'm so smart I know that life is shit, ~~wubalubadubdub~~"
Fuck no, most of the time that means that you only know how to echo empty talking points fed to you by society, and most likely don't have the emotional intelligence required to deal with the negative aspects of life
Folk dancing and choir, I'm quite sure this is the same for most Latvians
Currywurst
Definitely not
We already have so much junk food and fast food - both American and Soviet, chain and indie
Would much rather see something original
Interesting, in Latvia Hesburger is usually seen as the ghetto version of maccies
Although judging by the other replies to your post, it might be a personal preference thing
I like Hesburger because they usually have a more diverse menu than McD, and you also have them all over the country, as opposed to McD which is in Riga and only one or two outside of it
I’ve been to that Pret a lot
Hesburger is good
I'm from Latvia
But I stopped buying there because of one stupid policy they have
I ordered the food before on the app
But the app lagged out and ordered to the closest Hesburger to my work not my place
So I called my colleague who's was still at work
I asked him to drive to the Hesburger and get himself a free meal
He drove there , he was like 30 min after I ordered
Hesburger has a stupid ass policy that if your late, they will trow the food out
So all they could give him was the drink
I was so pissed at them and swore to not buy anything there again
It's so bs that they trow it out
Lies
I've bought fries and burgers that have been ready for longer than 30 min
Fuck that
Ive been to Helsinki hesburger
Its the same thing :D Even the coupons work
But it was a bit more expensive
My favorite was the Kebab burger with chilly sauce
In a year i will probably think of forgiving them
Yeah I think it was
But that's bullshit
I seriously doubt they 100% commit to that policy
They make burgers in reserve and who knows how long they lay there
There is no way they keep track of that
We say "e-pasts" translating to "e-post". I've heard some people use "vēstule(letter)," "ziņa(message)" and "gmails(gmail)" too
Germany/HRE
Russia/USSR
Sweden
Lithuania/PL Commonwealth
Estonia
Maybe because for most of written history we were mostly the same country (Livonia)
In some ways CS:GO is worse than EA games, since what you get is transferable, therefore sellable for real money
When you buy a loot box in Overwatch, you know you that what you get has $0 value
When you buy a case key in CS:GO, you are actually betting $2
5 of real money with the ability to win anywhere between ten cents and a few hundred dollars of real money
Yet, this isn't actually regulated like real-life gambling, and payout ratio is way lower than what casinos are legally required to provide
No age restrictions either
There's also an ecosystem of third party gambling and betting services that use CS:GO items as currency
Also unregulated, obviously
We get a few Moomins templates coming up here too
Lithuania and Estonia
we've been through mostly the same shit together
Lithuania and Latvia are a pretty strong pair
It's little to no difference if a Latvian meets another Latvian or a Lithuanian anywhere abroad and the other way round
Both would be really happy
Latvia and Lithuania without a doubt
Both country’s have similar Baltic languages and been through a lot historically
Do you guys call Estonia lil sister or something
We all know your opinion
Honestly, I see them the same
If I see Estonian in a game or whatever I'd say "Hiii brooo
I'm from Latvia
" and most of the time we would be very happy, but sometimes this Estonian can be a Finland simp that thinks that they above us or something and don't belong to Baltic States at all
Before learning about all this Finland simping I treated Estonians exactly the same way as Lithuanians, but now I'm a bit more careful
I'd say that all my friends feel about Estonians the same
We have a ton of shared history both with Estonians and Lithuanians, especially in the past 100 years, and we love them both very much
EDIT: me and all my friends also cheer for every baltic state in sport and stuff like this
To me it's kinda like we have 3 national teams
Can't see that it's true for everyone because I don't know really, but I thought I would let you know
we pretend to be happy but we're really not
I didn't even mentioned Latvia, m8
more like "the further south the more skilled you are at hiding the emptiness"
Already beautiful as it is
Wouldn't change a bit
Albeit I'd make the [Presidential Standard] as the main one
Simply a black cross over what it is now because that's what government does to the land I love so much
I think it's not only like that with Latvia
I'd like to avoid our flag being just another boring tricolor and it being mistaken with Austria, so I'd make the white and maroon play out more like the [belts from our national costumes] something like [Belarus] or [Setomaa] And honestly, even [the preliminary interpretation of the national flag] would be nice
Alternatively, the [merchant navy flag of the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia] is also somewhat iconic
The picture, however, displays a coat of arms as I couldn't find a flag
Not as cool as it's backstory though
Smart ass
True that, brother
I wonder how close we are to one another rn haha
Riga atm
One matched
How close to Akropole
Across the river in a straight line
Wow cool okay good night then buddy
People (mostly americans) who have never heard the language immediately think it would be like Russian cause "pOSt SovIeT cOuNTrY", but me and my family were in Austria once (so German speakers) and a couple of people said that they felt like they're listening to German but somehow cannot understand a word
I would like to hear more opinions though, since it's hard to look at your language from a non-speaker point of view
Whenever I hear Dutch it always feels like they're speaking English but the second I try to pay attention to the conversation they switch to German
And so I'm constantly trying to figure out whether they are speaking English and I don't understand for some reason or German, and then I'm like "oh wait, Dutch".
From what I've heard Icelandic is one of the only languages that pretty much haven't changed since the Viking ages so it would make sense that it sounds historic and viking-y. Not 100% sure if it's true though
Suprisingly Latvian has a lot in common with German
I didnt realise it until I started to learn German
Same
Love you, Iceland
Yes we do, it really means a lot to us that you recognized us as a state
Džon meid hiz vei srū ze dāk forest, onlī tu faind aut zat hī forgot ze monī.
We don't really have the "th" sound, so depending on the word, s/z/d is the closest approximation
Džān meid hiz vej trū d dārk forest, onlī tu faind aut det hī forgāt d manij
Džon mejd iz vej tu a tāvern frū da dork fārest, onlī tu faind aut det hī forgāt da mānij
Džon meid his vej tū a tevrn trū de dārk forest, ounlī tu faind aut det hī forgat de manī.
Jānis, izgājis cauri tumšajam mežam, bija pienācis pie kroga, tikai lai uzzinātu ka viņš aizmirsa paņemt līdzi naudu
Covid, unsurprisingly
We rode out the summer as the poster boy of Europe, everyone forgot everything, and now it's back with a vengeance
Apart from the usual idiots, people seem to think that if they, like, really really need something then by sheer force of will this cold heartless virus will not infect them
Back in spring through sheer luck we got ahead of events with the isolation rules, soft lockdowns, etc
- our stats were so low, we could get by even without masking rules, apart from a brief period of masks in public transportation
Right now we're skating to where the puck is right now, that is, catching up and reacting with inadequate measures while the stats get worse and worse
Doesn't help that half the population are idiots subscribing to some conspiracy theory or other
How does the decapitation fit into this - did the professor criticize islam or was he/she muslim
The nature thing is also that you're more likely to go outside the big cities, maybe go camping, that could bring the total cost down
Just the plain tourist experience in the big cities could get costly
same here pretty much
Reminds me when an F1 driver (I think Nico Rosberg (now retired)) splashed champagne on the podium, on Vladimir Putin, and many in the racing world said the same
Well this is one of the nicest subs out there, and I’ve learned lots just by reading stuff here
By proxy, my boyfriend also learns since I tend to read stuff out loud from here
Love you fellow Europeans
And everyone else - you’re ok too
[Saule, Pērkons, Daugava]
Could be familiar to some Catalonians as well
Either [Sun, Thunder, Daugava] or [The Eternal Milkyway]
Suprisingly a lot of people and a quarter of them are probably tourists
The old architecture is pretty cool but the further you go from the centre, the trashier it gets
Lived in many different parts of Riga, while it's light out it's nice and everyone usually minds their own business,  when it gets dark there are some places that you shouldn't go to, old town and city centre is usually safe, in some parts it's quite dead at night, where I currently live I can hear some illegal racing between 00:00 and 04:00
I hate public transport
Bums, teens, drunks ... No private space
Covid 19 - masks
Isn't this being done kind of already
I know in Latvia they are building the Baltic Rail to unite the Baltics with central Europe and I've definitely heard about train projects all over Europe to connect to the bigger countries
Edit: i think they promised until 2040 for all trains to be up and moving
Can you tell me more about this
This is the first time I've heard this
I did hear about this in the news
I thought it was super cool :)
In Latvia, it's the pronunciation of November (Novembris in Latvian)
Half of the Latvians believe it should be pronounced as Novembrees (with straight thick O), while the other half (including me :) believes it should be pronounced Nuovembrees . Basically, there's no rule for how to pronounce this word and both pronunciations are correct
Whether okroshka is made on kvass base or kefir base
Realising your friend knows your other friends, and thet friends friend knows your friends as well etc
and then you say: damn Latvia really is a small place
We have a bridge in the capital Riga called "Deglava tilts" it was deemed unsafe for loads over 30 tonnes, so they decided to rebuild it, along with a new road for pedestrians
They did the pedestrian part in 2 years, TWO YEARS
And they still have some barriers left, so its not reaaaly finished
And on the "making the bridge safer part", they put some big steel stuff on 1/8th of the bridge, its still unfinished for 2 years
No worries, we got your back (at least to distract some attention)
Riga has zero decent concert halls to be labelled national concert hall
The national symphonic orchestra is performing in a lovely but cramped 19th century building (Lielā Ģilde) in the Old Town and no government can come to an agreement where to build the new one and they've been looking for a location for at least 10 years now
Meanwhile, newly built concert halls are popping up in every self-aware small-town, one of those with a rather cocky city mayor just opened a concert-hall named Latvia (in a town of some 30k residents)
People have bought out all of the face masks, yet I have not seen a single person with a face mask
I can't find any buckwheat, as well
i just realised the latvian word "miers" (peace) probably comes from that
I bet she's really randy
Spiridon is definitely Greek
At least over here there's a certain ultranationalist connotation with those kinds of ancient names
(I mean generally, not just those Russian names in particular
The moustache, too
I mean jeans were original made by Levi Strauss and Jacob W. Davis a Latvian born american
Jacob W. Davis, the man who invented jeans, and then partnered with Levi Strauss to mass produce them, [was born in Latvia] Also the creator of the [Minox Riga] often considered the best spy camera during the early cold war due to its extremely small size, [Walter Zapp] was a baltic german born in Latvia
Latvian invented jeans, so your everday pants has been invented in Latvia
I speak little Russian and now this makes so much sense
There's a thing called Revolut where you pay the same fee everywhere
I believe this was tried in USSR if you want to research the various issues involved .....
Tesla uses CCS for Model 3 and includes a CCS adapter by default with others
What
Transfer money to Revolut, it costs like 40c, and then use a Revolut card for an ATM
A simple Rev card costs is like 7 euro for 5 years
And take out money for free All over the Europe 50 times a year or something like that
Yes, we have the Russian gauge for our current railways but the new [Rail Baltica] is built in European standard gauge
Not true
Visa is global
Revolut cards use Visa, no one can track you
It's your bank's issue, it's stuck in 20th century
Change local bank or just transfer your paycheck to a Revo card
Probably the issue is that it's you countries fault you don't have euro as a base currency
I can withdraw much more as a Eurozone citizen
I think Quisling is used much more widely than English
Even we use it despite the Iron Curtain, albeit not that often
Ah, could it be any other country to give birth to world's least violent game
They wanted or it happened and they decided to make the most of it
I’d like to thank the Lithuanians, for fighting the oppressive crusaders around 700 years ago, and later making them their vassals
If it wasn’t for them, the Baltic would’ve been completely under crusader control, and the Baltic might’ve been completely germanified by today
But Latvia
This isn’t just in Latvia, but also in Lithuania, Estonia and quite a few Slavic countries too, but [Kvass]
yeah, we love it here
Yeah we have bottled kvass here
That's a good attitude
Something my country desperately needs, a healthy look at history unclouded by nostalgia and mystified origins of the nation
English
Also, I don't think games get translated in Latvian anyway
But even if they were, I'd pick English
I prefer playing games and watch movies in English, since translations are not always accurate and sometimes it seems weird not sure why
Games are never translated in my language, but even if they were i would probably play in english
I read harry potter in Latvian first and i had a hard time understanding which charachter was which in english, bc the names in english were very different, and i wouldn't want to deal with that again
Never seen this even tho we used to get a lot of snow, educational
Thank you
12th of January 1969 a residential building exploded due to a gas leak,  the explosion killed 41 people, among them 14 were kids
The Soviets did their best to sweep this under the rug, and was only widespread knowledge after the collapse of the USSR
I cant remember any, probably some explosions during WW2
Bridges or smth
As I'd heard it, those were the ambassadors of those countries that met regularly to exchange the post
I hope they're lying for marketing's sake or that's an E.Coli outbreak waiting to happen
Urine does
Russia invaded Ukraine, so Americans boycotted Latvian vodka
Building 5-6 floor buildings is more manageable and cheaper and friendlier for environment
No need for expensive projects and elevators
It's also better for transportation
No need for wide roads and a lot of cars
Public transportation becomes convenient
It's more secure as anyone can leave a house fast in case of emergency
Plus it fits in historical architecture among houses which are very old
"Gatavs(i) vai nē, es eju meklēt!"
In latvian showel is Lāpsta, pronounce- Laapsta
We have a brand of baby diapers called "Pamper" and by thid point a lot of people don't even know that pamperi is not the actual word for diapers
Vegeta and toi-toi
A man of culture
I would argue that [Bankomat AB] appears to be founded in 2010, whilst we have definitely had the word for a long time before that
In Latvian there is just this one word 'bankomāts', no other synonym
I just had a look at the Latvian newspaper archive periodika
lv, here's an [article] from 1990 (when Latvia was not yet independent), a regional newspaper had published a helpful article on how these cash machines work and on the plans of the [still existing] Soviet Union to introduce non-cash transactions
Edit: When I talk about 'we', I mean society at large, not just those speaking Latvian
Edit 2: I might be wrong – after reading the Wikipedia article more closely (my Swedish skills are rather basic), I see that the company is older than it appeared at first glance
Thanks for the clarification, I take my words back
What about Swedish language, do you have any other synonyms you would use besides 'bankomat'?
For some reason in UK they are called “cash point machine” which seems clunky and takes longer to say than “ATM”.
"Pūķis" is word used for both
It literally means a dragon
Sometimes you call kite "gaisa pūķis" which means air dragon
Yep
In Latvian we have "pūķis", which means both kite and dragon
While "gaisa pūķis" is absolutely correct, it feels *so* weird to say it
But I don't have conversations about kites often, so it might be just me
ye, especially when most dragon depictions for Latvians is ones who can fly, so I kinda see that addition as redundant as well
Drunk british tourists pissing on our freedom monument
And when I was in Croatia Plitvice lakes a lot of tourists where feeding the ducks and fish(a lot of signs indicate that it's forbidden) by throwing bread in crystal clear lakes
Most of it justs floats there uneaten (fish and ducks are overfed and don't want to eat anymore) and ruins the view
Piss on the freedom monument
Oh, they're there
I meet Latvian speakers in all sorts of places
Russian, 30 percent of our population are russians
The 2nd biggest city in Latvia has more russians than latvians, it's quite sad really
Technically illegal but not enforced AT ALL and easy to acquire
Hell, I went to the No
1 high school in the country and a TON of super smart kids with bright futures did it, so yeah, not a big deal here
I think it is quite popular but not too often used by teenagers 14-18 years old and young adults too
In general if you use it i think most adults who don't know anything about it would consider you a junkie
> most adults above 40 years old think that cannabis is as bad as heroine while they drink spirits every evening
A lot of hypocrites here
This
Fairly popular among young people,  most people I know have smoked it at least once
Then there is split - who loves it and use occasionally or who dislikes it and stays with drinking
But overall in my social circle it's well tolerated
So you make all girls, whose dad happened to have name with g at end, feel like he was a piece of shit
Thus is a really weird way to practice generational curses
In Latvian there are two words for it : *sliedes* (track) and *dzelzs ceļš* (iron road)
Yes there are a few forests where you won't find anyone or any buildings if you walked for hours
Though realistically they aren't big enough to get completely lost in
Considering that a lot of our country is occupied by forests, yes
Which ones
The Coast of Northern Kurzeme is one of the main ones, since it has very few villages on the way and most of the forests there have been untouched in decades
The second main contender i can think of is a forest which as far as I know isn't named, so I will just explain its location
Its the forest roughly between Aizkraukle, Valle and Sproģi. And the surrounding forests around that one are also quite large and empty, well when it comes to Humans or human build structures, there are plenty of Wolves and Lynx in that area
Our current head of state (prime minister) was born in another country (US
It woudn't be very controversial since 2 of our formers presidents were born outside Latvia
Vaira Vike Freiberga was born in Canada, I reckon, but Raimonds Vejonis was born in Russia
Oh and our Prime Minister Krisjanis Karins was born in Delawere, USA
Cant think of anything, Latvians, help me
Only one in Latvia would be Sputnik, since they're posting Russian propaganda
Baltics stick together
Always
Yeah I've seen a lot of people (including me) wear them here
Boys use really racist and sexist and based jokes while most of women are offended by everything
It's sad, but true
During the 2018 Song and Dance Festival closing event, our previous president Raimonds Vējonis had a bit of a mishap with his speech
Basically, he misspoke a lot and at one point called the Song festival (dziesmu svētki) - "Christmas" (Ziemassvētki),  the wind blew away his notes, and at one point just honestly said: "I'm sorry, I'm very nervous
The amazing thing here is that his last name "Vējonis" derives from "vējš", which means "wind".
Honestly I can feel for him here
I'm very nervous when it come to public speaking and I tend to stumble over my words when I'm nervous as well
Same, it was a very human moment
Currently it's no buckwheat
In Latvia yesterday was made the decision to close all schools, kindergartens and Universities from today
Half of my office is empty, because people stayed at home with their children
But not everyone can work from home
Conservatives right wing, LOL
They are centre with a leftist bent
UK people don’t know right wing
I think OP is talking about present day, not 30 years ago
Most Redditors were not born when Thatcher was already done
And her reforms have stood the test of time - no one seriously proposes undoing any of Thatchers changes,  neither modern Labour nor LibDems nor Conservatives
The benevolent liberal socialist society of today, as represented by both the Labour and Conservative parties, was partly shaped by Thatcher - certainly the freedoms enjoyed by individuals and private enterprises to stand on their own feet and demand more from Government, rather than simply accept their place as a cog in the wheels of the state run society, and a condescendingly patriarchal society at that
The UK now would be a very different place without the Thatcher years and I don’t assume 100% “better”.
Who is this person
You mean liberal wet Boris
LOL
Whoever described him like that should take a look at party leaders across Europe
Even that EU data oriented website lists UK Conservatives as centre-right and UK Labour as centre-left
It’s like splitting hairs
Only the people in the UK want to make a big polarised tribal argument out of it
In reality, if UK had some of the really right wing parties from other European countries then they would really have something to complain about
As it is they just bash soft Boris
Wasn’t Ken Livingstone referred to as “Red Ken” and during his GLC years affiliated with Militant movement ?  Maybe his view is not 100% unbiased
Well I wasn’t speaking as a political scientist
But as an outsider from another European country, seems both main UK parties have policies to sustain some form of free market liberal socialism, just with balance between social policies and market policies slightly different for each party
Where I am from doing this would definitely be a leftist bent
compared to more straightforwardly right groups
Yes thank you that was exactly my point
You call ‘left’ and ‘right’ what other nations would call ‘centerish’.  I think it’s because you all seem to be permanently aching for a fight
I suppose "Nu, labi" would be the closest, it translates to well, ok
Same in Latvian “nu jā” or “nu labi” both Pretty much mean “well yeah “
Pieņemsim and lai būtu are also similar in meaning
A first name and a last name
If parents wanna be really fancy they can ofc give as many names as they like or maybe have 2 last names (for them upon marriage or for their child) for some reason, however this is quite rare
And I'll never understand wtf is a middle name
What about Philippos Andreou of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderberg-Glücksburg Prince of Greece and Denmark
aka Philip Mountbatten-Windsor
aka Prince Philip husband of Queen Elizabeth II of United Kingdom
Farming in a field with a German baron yelling at me
[Where] [do] [I] [start]
TL; DR: Lots and lots of commieblocks
I wouldn't say that it's any ugly, I really like the looks tbh, but I've heard a lot that this building is really tasteless and not at all attractive
So, would be interesting to hear your opinions on[The national library of Latvia] Designed by [Gunārs Birkerts] an architect known for designing multiple buildings in the US it was his gift to his Homeland
If you ask me personally, then my answer would be very boring
For me, the ugliest buildings in Latvia are three "skyscrapers" 100 meter tall each, built in the soviet times, absolutely generic
One of them has been rebuilt to a hotel, the second is used as a huge ad banner, but the last one standing is still screwing up the riverside view of Riga (all buildings here relate to this city)
Germany has much uglier buildings than that
Usually there are studies about different religions in course of culture history, like basics about the major ones
There’s no other option than Rīga
It’s the biggest city and half the population of the whole country live here
The rest of the country certainly wouldn’t accept a Latgalian/Russian city as the capital so Daugavpils is out of the question
Liepāja could be a potential candidate, but it’s too small and far from the rest of the country to match Rīga
Hah, I did the Trans-Siberian a few years ago; that was an eye opener
Fuck it, Chelyabinsk for new capital
After all, в Челябинске лучше торчать.
I wouldn’t say that: there’s the stereotype of people from there being a bit backwards but everyone gets on fine
There’s a small Latgalian independence movement that none of the rest of the country take seriously though
It’s more that Latgale and especially Daugavpils has a very high (up to and over 50% in some areas) Russian population where a lot of them don’t even speak Latvian
So moving the capital to Daugavpils would definitely be seen as a move back under Russian sphere of influence which most of the Latvian population would resent
Then there’s the language issue for even the non-Russian population, is Latgalian a separate language, or is it a dialect of Latvian
Every Latvian has a different opinion on that, depending on how well they understand Latgalian, which would definitely complicate matter in moving the capital there
I do t think we are important to EU
Heck, most people I have met think Latvia is the same contrie as Lithuania
We on the other hand need EU very much
They help us in so many areas
Our role is literally to be mixed up with Lithuania
English, because of the spelling and all those silent letters
Seriously, why do you need those
And why would you need so many different sounds for the same letters
German, have been learning it for the 3rd year and I cant even make basic sentences, but I started learning Norwegian since summer and i seem to be able to figure out many things right now
They spell long vowels as two letters and these are compound words (this is ice edge according to OP and I think the other one is work night or something)
It's just an orthographic issue
reminds me of old Latvian orthography having neeeeet for modern neieiet
I guess pronouncing the k was too much work for them
Pretty sure this one is intuitive for them
I don't really know anything about the Balkan wars beyond that they happend I the Balkans
>Anything to do with the Baltic States during before, during and after soviet occupation
Post ww1 Baltic States win their wars of independence (Lithuania losses viļņus)
Interwar period Latvia in 1934 has a coup and establishes a dictatorship
that last till 1940
I believe Estonia and Lithuania also had dictatorships at the time
Molotov-ribontrop pact gives the Baltic to the Soviets in 1940 they occupy the Baltics
Then a year in latvian called "baigā gada" (year of Terror)
Where slot of people were sent out to gulags
Then the Nazi come establishes foreign as divisions for Latvia and Estonia and then do Nazi shit the area
Then the Soviets come back and do Stalin shit
Then 50 year of Soviet rule untill
The singing revaluation (1980s) started In Estonia but later spread to the rest
This was a protest to Soviet rule without fighting commutated in the Baltic way (1989) longest human chain connected the three capitals
1990s the Baltic governments vote to leave the Union
1990-91 in Latvian referred to as "barikāžu laiks" (Time of barricades) In which we waited for action Frome both the west and Soviets civilians constricted [barricades] to stop potential intervention
Omon opens fier In the Baltic States (here's a [Lithuania man getting run over]
1991 USSR collapses independence secured start of a lot of political and economic instability crime and corruption rampet
2004 Latvia jons the EU and nato
Estonia Lithuania did the same I. Different dates
A "quick" overview of the Baltics
If you want can do the same for Latvia I the Russian empire
The main event is on the 24th, you would normally go and visit family on the 25th and 26th
Fun fact, Christmas in Latvian is "Ziemassvētki" which directly translates as "Winter celebration", a remainder of our pagan past
Brecon beacons were lovely, coming from a very flat place it was a tough hike up the Pen y fan, but the views were so worth it
And West Virginia is north of Virginia
Technically не isn't a word so that's not really a good example
But yes, it matter sometimes
Russian i dunno why but its really hard and i keep messing it up with latvian language rules
I'm learning German as well and I find it quite easy
I'm fluent in English and a lot of the vocabulary is similar, also I'm Latvian and older Latvian has some German influence (but the two languages are almost nothing alike)
The grammar is a bit tricky but they have strict grammar rules to follow and although I learn German in school I also do it on Duolingo and I learn grammar just through habit
French for me so far
The vocabulary is not that hard but damn why you gotta add a bunch of useless little words that don't translate
The pronunciation isn't that bad either, it just takes practice, every time I try to say something I just imagine that I'm mocking someone and it works
Given that I'm trying to lose my British passport as soon as possible, I have yet to see a reason why anyone would not be
Honestly I don't trust any kind of Unions
But so far so good
Fuck yea
It's pretty easy to think of them, with my British passport I've not stopped hearing about them for 4 years
How anyone can think there's any way it will be better after Brexit is baffling
I disagree
The borders and all the hassle of going to another country makes one view those people as something more different than they are, the mysterious foreigners, the noble savages, etc
Now you can see that we're all just people
Culture and language should be defined by, well, culture and language, not border controls
And London Gatwick
And, bizarrely, Buenos Aires - last month I got an internal flight in Argentina that was operated by Norwegian
I was confused too
Jackbooted thugs rouse you from your slumber and drag you by the scruff of the neck to the nearest polling station
Esotericism is a relatively big thing, as is homeopathy
Interestingly enough, interest in these subjects is mostly prevalent in younger, decently educated and well-off people
The last big hubbub was about the introduction 5G mobile networks
There was a myth, originating in Russia and then amplified by local "gurus" and popular people in the entertainment industry, that 5G is super dangerous to you and that it's going to microwave your brain, since "it's one the same frequency as a microwave".
In Latvia there are also many women who believe in horoscopes
But there is a bigger population of people who believe in superstition
My family is not one of those, so most of the superstitions I know, I have learned from my BF's mom
Like, why would putting my bag on the ground mean I will have no money
Or cleaning the table with my hand and not a cloth will also mean I will have no money
What do You mean, if I swipe dirt towards the door I will swipe my luck away
So, if I want to argue with a person, I just have to give him a knife (or any other sharp object) hand to hand
What kind of nonsense is this
HOW DO THESE THINGS CORRELATE
No one admits to selling inferior products here, they avoid it by claiming that it’s to cater to different consumer preferences or different purchasing power
I think you might be onto something right there
Have you considered writing a book on the general subject
Why in the Netherlands the bottle of water costs 2 euros
In Latvia 2l of water costs about 30 cents with deposit it is 40 cents, it just surprised me when I saw that big of a price for 2l of water
It's weird I was in the Netherlands in 2017, and when I shopped in local Jumbo the price for a bottle of water was 1
99 or something like that
Oh, thanks for explaining
You talking about Minecraft, right
Me too
First I thought that maybe it is pronounced completely different in Latvian, but no, don't think I have heard of that one
If you want to learn Latvian, the first step would be to forget every language you've ever known
Then learn the pronounciations of the letters
The primary word stress, with only some exceptions, is on the first syllable, so it's not that hard
Then learn grammatical cases and other stuff
Our nouns have 7 grammatical cases: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, instrumental, locative and vocative
Nouns have six declension classes, three for masculine nouns, three for feminine nouns
Then learn idk what there's lots of other grammar rules
Then learn words
No, it's Baltic
Hate that farcical nonsense
But omg did you see Latvia’s backup dancers
Someone should put some stars on that blue banner, maybe in a circle
So the solution is for every country to take in turns trying to conquer the planet
I like it
If you dont close the door she will say:
You weren't born in a tram
My favourite response to the magic word one is to just say abracadabra
Yes we spell it exactly as it sounds
Edit: the answer is actually no because i misunderstood the question
I had Norwegian lessons in Trondheim on Erasmus
We were told that in Norwegian all letters are pronounced
Then I had to pronounce "studenter samfundet" and found out that the previous sentence was a lie
In Latvian, it is also 99% of the time
Though when reading pronunciation is only perfect for new words like 95% of the time because of the letter ''o'', as it has 3 different pronunciations, but a native speaker will be able to guess which pronunciation is used in most cases
No there is because there are some fucky words
Like lauzt which means break
It has three different forms which sound exactly the same but are spelled different: lauzt, laust, lauzst
im dumb, sorry
on about 60% of words you can, but we have fucky words as i said before
For example  Aizkari is pronounced Aiskari, without the z. And with the word lauzt you need to look at the word after/before the word lauzt
So i guess the answer to the original question is no
99% of the time you can spell it correctly though, so, almost xD
"Where the baron goes"
"Šaursliežu dzelzceļš" and "glāžšķūņu rūķīši" are probably the usual suspects
The former is "narrow gauge railroad" and the latter is kinda non-sensical ("dwarves of the glass shed"), it's not really used for anything
"Pretpulksteņrādītājvirziens" (counter-clockwise), "Šaursliežu dzelzceļš" (narrow gauge railroad) or "šis žagaru saišķis nav mans žagaru saišķis ( this bundle of twigs is not my bundle of twigs), but even the latter is quite the challange for native speakers
> And 'Cholmondley' is pronounced 'Chumley'.
That caught me off-guard when I was watching "Taboo".
In latvian we mostly use “Vecīt” which means old man
Sometimes people use “Bračka” diminutive of “Brāli” Which means brother
Recently I've been saying veči a lot, translates to guys or old men
Not yet
Tbh I'm not sure if we have such a thing, at least I haven't heard of it
Watching American movies as a kid this concept would always confuse me
I guess the closest thing would be the so called "landguards" where you do and help with all kinds of army stuff except, from what I understand, you still count as a civilian and you don't have to be 18 years of age to get accepted, also ofc you don't get paid I think
I'd day kinda like an army volunteer
Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong
Not even guilty pleasure but one of the most popular Lavian songs : Bruģis - Kaija
We must travel to a river, a lake or the sea and swim in it when there is 30 plus celsius outside
I can agree with this
Nope, either you sign it off before you receive it or you get a paper saying that you have to go to the post office to pick it up

Ugunsgrēks = Fire-sin (fire as a tragedy, e.g. a forest fire or house fire)

I love how I can understand the Lithuanian sentence, even without the translation
I guess that's how similar the Baltic languages are
Same, and I believe it's the same in every language that distinguishes second person singular and plural
A bear
Literally, a single bear and we share him with Estonia
Probably bears, though we don’t have many (around 30 or so I think)
Most of them live around Kolka peninsula but there are some in the east towards Russian border in Latgale too
I’m not sure if any cross the Russian border because there’s a fence through most of it

"Blizzard of Souls" - movie about Latvian independece war
Only rivaled by the magnificent New Kids Turbo
Not only do I know of it, it has a cult film status among many of my friends and acquaintances
I've seen it 10+ times, mostly showing it to other people, seeing their reaction, laughing our asses off together
Not sure how it all started though, I was just another link in the chain of people
As of going international, there was an absolutely exquisite Russian (which is a common minority language here) translation of it, which certainly helped
I haven't seen it in 5 years at least, so it's tough to say, but I can't imagine why wouldn't it be
Well, other than perhaps me becoming more and more dead inside year by year, but that has nothing to do with the movie though
Yeah we even raided those puny americans with their area 51 back in the 17 century
I like that Latvian is quite a rare language, so if I go abroad nobody can understand me
Also it's very poetic and peculiar, but it takes years to understand this as a non native speaker because it ties in with our culture and history a lot
In Latvian you basically have the ability to deminutise (make small/cute) every word
For example,
money = nauda
little/cute/tiny money = naudiņa
dog = suns
little/cute/tiny dog = sunītis
Also, we take a LOT of influence from other languages (swedish, finnish, german, russian), so sometimes we can understand sort of what they're talking about, especially Lithuanians, because we have a very similar language in general
We have this in Latvia, it's beloved by most people but I hate it for some reason IDK why
Very common in everyday language, but shouldn’t be used in a proffesional environment
In highschool I said “okay” to my latvian lit teacher and she threathened to throw me out of class if I ever said it again
I agree, but it worked and I never said “okay” in her class again
Duchy of Courland, specifically - the West one third of current day Latvia
The rest together with Estonia formed Livonia, at that time a dominion of Sweden
Here at least LotR somehow closely followed Harry Potter in being translated, but Hobbit was translated earlier than that
So LotR is translated simmilarly to Potter series and for some reason Baggins was left as in Hobbit, but in LotR turned to Tuntaks, which doesn't even mean anything, and there were other weirdnesses
Actually even with Potter it was a bit weird, although my understanding is that it was common in several languages, I thonk the only fantasy book series they churned out back then in which the style suited was Arthemis Fowl
I noticed that they now also have given this trwatment to ASoIaF, which doesn't even make sense for the most part - there is no way you'd think that's a book for children, which needs to be dumbed down
Supposedly the artworks and relics inside have been rescued:
The building itself is a piece of art, of course, but not much anyone can do about that
We don't dislike Riga, I believe
I live near it though
Also, 1/3 of our population lives in Riga
Need someone more remote to confirm
Most people are bilingual (English/Latvian), some being trilingual (English/Latvian/Russian or German)
The only ones not being able to speak any other language, other than their own, are senior citizens especially from minority groups (for example russians)
As far as I know, you can name your child virtually anything you please, provided that the name follows the Latvian orthography (foreign names will have to be respelled, i.e. George >> Džordžs or Georgs)
Should an inappropriate name be selected, the custody court will vehemently argue with the parents about the consequences in the child's life

I grew up on the south coast of UK where France and Belgium were just a few hours boat ride away
Naturally, I assumed that most European countries had similar on their coastlines, and that people in South of Italy or Greece just hopped on a boat to go to Egypt all the time
Wasn't until I was in my late teens I realised how few people in South UK had even bothered to taken that 90 minute boat or 30 minute train to France
Apart from the small roasters, of the more widely available brands it has to be the Costa Rican [Britt] Illy is also ok
I had a French gf, she was an exchange student, it was fun exploring the cultural differences
You definetly hear it less at least in Latvia
The older people probably don't even know  system since it came here  rather recantly from english language
Now younger people use words like milleniāļi or boomeri
But everyone uses general words like (senior - senjors, adult - pieaugušais, teenager- pusaudzis, kid - bērns)
not that i know of
sometimes we say some words quickly and it might sound like a one-letter word, but I'm pretty sure we dont have any
I'm not one to jump in and disclose how much I earn right away, but I don't perceive it as rude
Plenty of my friends have told me how much they make
I dont really know, but I've heard that Albania is pretty muslim and muslims don't drink that much alcohol
Formaly in pre-school class and by the time I allready had decided I like it and it just came naturally to me
What I found helpfull in terms of immersion was Runescape and the option to examine every object in the game for explanation on what it is
In real life I apply the same concept by Googling nearly every word I don't understand
However this is only good, if you allready have decent knowledge, it us not feasible when you have to check everything
I started watching cartoons in English when I was really young and that worked out
I have no idea how I learnt spelling, reading and writing, though
>Iceland
I went on Erasmus to Iceland to one of the weirder options - Hvanneyri near to Borgarnes
Went on the purpose of experiencing the emptiness and bankruptcy  of living in Iceland
Have to say that I really enjoyed the experience of studying there
I can easily tell if someone is a foreigber, but not from where exactly
Unless they are also 2m high, then Dutch :D
Once in a simillar discussion I discovered that in other languages people don't seem to even have a concept of idiomatic phrase for our "What's inside the teddy bear's tummy
", which is really weird since exploring inner workings of things seems to be important part of childhood development and it is usefull for speaking about other things too
On funny level we say that there's soap, when there's a big trouble and call situations and things that are hard to comprehend, and sometimes troubling, butter
Laime Pilnīga, this is my favorite one:
And also not from my country but from Iceland- Hatari
Probably [Laika Suns] or [Carnival Youth]
Riga and Liepaja have a big rivalry in soccer and basketball, when they are playing things get heated and sometimes (not since COVID) there are fans from both sides who get violent with each other, it is crazy
Most of Greek Cypriots that I know would never cross "border" of North Cyprus
They say that for them, Turkish people occupied their land
I’m pretty sure Latvia has about 3-4 dialects/accents
No but we have 4 (maybe 5 IDK Im not so good at history) dialects (divided by past terretorys)
So there isn't very big diffrence but the terretorys are Up, down, (in the past another down but little bit to the right united whit down), right (The most noticable one like good luck understanding what do they mean), left
In latvia there's 4 national states and I know every state has a different dialect but I don't really know if every city has its own
My city, Ventspils, has a different dialect then rest of the country
We don't really finish the words we say like we would say a  word and just toss a few letters out so it sound kinda simpler
I'm a simple man: I hear Bruseles I think EU officials (and a bit of a sprout tho)
Seriously, sure I know where Brussels is, but now it invokes connotation with EU institutions first and in this context never extrapolated on Belgium and its people
I didn't even rememer Brussels was in Belgium
EU has appropriated it, and Belgium is almost never mentioned in context
The "culture" programme in my high school (gymnasium) had a Formal Etiquette subject, but I haven't heard that any other school in Latvia would have that
Also, grades 5-12 we have a sepperate subject to learn our language (grammar, syntax, etc) and a sepperate subject for literature as a whole
I haven't heard that those two would be sepperate elsewhere
1st to 5th grade we could choose one class- religious education or ethics
i'm not religious so i did ethics and we learned about emotions, manners, being kind to people, life goals and that kind of stuff
it was fun because we did some wholesome stuff and played games
we have it too
we also have psychology from 10th to 12th grade
[Valka/Valga] on the Latvian/Estonian border
Well
Valka is literally on the border, the city is split between Latvia and Estonia
Valka(Valga) on the Estonian-Latvian border
Valga in Latvia is a town split in half by Estonia and Latvia
I've heard a lot of the locals know the other side's language, but otherwise probably Russian for people >40 and English for those <40
Latvians see the USSR as a time of suffering loss and repression because we were occupied by it, but many Russians want it back because they want to regain the power and glory they once had as a country
A lot of people in Russia still praise Lenin and Stalin
It's crazy
Yes, I was raised to change when getting home, I buy fleece jackets and sweatpants for this
Anything that is not past Russia's Europe to the East
Helsinki
My girlfriend lives there
Hoping to go there already next week (if travel restrictions are lifted)
As for other locations, Vienna
Beautiful city, and want some sort of vacation this year
Copenhagen, I was there just before they closed the borders on an exchange program, I met a new friend there, but our time was cut short, so I would like to visit her
I also really want to explore the city more, I felt like it was a place for me
We just say "et", so there isn't a fun meaning behind it
Same in Latvian
Never hear of anything other than at
Also means nothing
If Latvia get kicked out of hockey I cheer for either Canada because I have family there, or Finland because one of my best friends is Finnish
It's always fun to rub it in his face when Dinamo beat Jokerit, but still, Finland doing well is inevitable
Aside from San Marino, they're all mega expensive as destinations to visit, and not really worth the money - as someone who's visited every country in Europe
Cool places to say you've been to, but easily as travel destinations you'll have a more enjoyable time in almost any other European country
Politically, well, I dislike tax havens that essentially survive and thrive on the basis of fucking over the rest of us economically, but, they don't seem to be going anywhere
I'd like to see them join the EU to be held to the same standards as other countries and contribute their fair share instead of just reaping the benefits of Schengen, also
Russia who else
Russia, obviously
russia
At least we can sit down in the bar and share our love for ice hockey with you
I wasn't expecting Australian inquisition
We have one chain called Lido which kinda does that thing, they aren't so cheap as they used to be
Business lunches are pretty popular, especially in central Riga, and that's normally some cheap Latvian dish for like €3 a portion or something
Also we have places called "kafejnīca" which is kinda somewhere that's a cafe in the daytime, and a bar in the evening
Or like a mix of the two
Yeah, it's our Latvian fast food chain
Any of them
I mean any one in our language, not that they're all great and catchy
Ohh Ich liebe beide Major Tom-Versionen, und Der Komissar
Ich hab' sie beide gehört lang bevor Ich dieses Post geöffnet hatte
Erwartete nicht diese Lieder hier zu sehen, doch es war eine angenehme Überraschung
(I'm still learnig German, sorry for grammatical mistakes)
Anything from brainstorm
Famous worldwide
The question was never gona be famous
And of course we loaned the German word and have turned it into "špikot" - to cheat/copy and "špikeris" - the cheat sheet
As far as I can tell, these words have no other meaning for us
Latvian is full of Germanisms, at least colloquially
So that's where we got "Špikeris"!
Same here
The noun is "špikeris" and the verb is "špikot".
One that comes to mind is "riktīgs" (Latvian meaning true, proper), coming from *richtig*. You could say
Viņš ir riktīgs latvietis - He's a proper/true Latvian
It's more of an old people thing to say, but I use it quite often in sentences like "riktīgi forši" ("really cool")
There are quite a few German loan words in literary language as well
I'm not that great at remembering things off the top of my head, but here are some I found online: Amats (Amt), bomis (Baum), brilles (Brille), dienests (Dienst), ēvele (Hövel), flīģelis (Flügel), glazūra (Glasur), glāze (Glas), kaste (Kasten), klucis (Kloz), krogs (Krõgh), kleita (Kleid), ķirsis (Kirsche), panna (Pfanne), pudele (Buddel), pīpe (Pipe), spainis (Span), stārķis (Storch), smēre (Schmiere), spēle (Spiel), stunda (Stunde), telts (Telt), zāģis (Säge), ziepes (Seife)
Zapte means jam (the preserve), špannungs - electricity, šlāgeris - old people music
Our school did have lockers before renovation started and 1st graders still do, but otherwise we have a cloakroom and carry our books with us
The lockers weren't owned by the school tho, so if you wanted a locker or finished the school you had to find somebody who wants to sell/buy yours
One year I squatted in a locker, because there were many that were unused
I wanted to buy a lock to lock it but it took too long to arrive and the next year they got rid of them
One of the smallest countries in Europe and we've also got a really old flag
The third oldest in the whole world, actually
Fifth fastest internet in the world

So much singing, we have a festival for that every 5 years
Live fast, die young
Bosnia and Herzegovina definetly isn't the most corrupt country in Europe so not fully true
And the finno-ugric languages :
-Hungarian
-Estonian
-Finnish
-Saami
I'm not sure
Gibt es etwas (Außer dem Autobahn) das Deutschland macht besser als die anderen
Ich immer noch lerne die Sprache, und will in der Zukunft da leben
Well by almost every metric Russia is the most corrupt country in Europe, and then after that it's pretty much Ukraine, Moldova
And they are noticeably more corrupt than the next 4 countries which are about equally corrupt with Albania and Bosnia & Herzegovina being a little more corrupt than the other 2 which are North Macedonia and Kosovo
I made that a little too confusing, basically the most corrupt countries in Europe go like this:
Russia,
(Slight gap in corruption level)
Ukraine,
Moldova,
(Medium gap in corruption level)
Albania,
Bosnia and Herzegovina,
North Macedonia,
Kosovo
Thank you for that, I did not know there was still such a wide variety of finno-ugric languages left
Nah I love the Autobahn
That's half the reason I'm moving to Germany
But if you don't like it, of course, that's also fine
I love the pretty much free education tho
That's really awesome
Yeah, all of those mentioned are good countries
This is one source that I could give you, it's not perfect though, but it gives a somewhat realistic picture of how corrupt each country is
Some countries corruption levels arent accurate in my opinion, for example from what I've heard I would put Bosnia and herzegovina a bit lower down maybe closer to Moldovas level, though not at that level, and my own country of Latvia I would put a bit lower at probably the high 40s instead of 56
Russia I imagine could be even more corrupt than what it portrayed as in that index, Ukraine maybe same thing
"It is every Germans' contitutional right to go on a family trip in a VW van at the speed of a cruise missile"
This is the best paragraph in the Constitution imo
Only longer distance busses (inter-city) and only when exiting through the front door
No, only times you should talk to a driver in public transport if you need a ticket or if there is an emergency
Why would You do that
Cram through all the bus to get to the front for a "thank You" to a bus driver, who doesn't even care
Who yells through all the bus a quick thanks
We dont do that here
Fuck blizzard
Once I'm out of my sick bed, I'll uninstall overwatch and their launcher too
Spineless fuckers
They and other xi dick sucking corporations are clear remainders that rich people doesn't give a fuck about regimes as long as they are good
Corps should be regulated harder and CEOs and major shareholders should be put on trial for shit they pull
Probably one of the biggest fuck ups company could do
This just gives Chinese influence here even bigger power here and if we all are going to act like those spineless fuckers at Blizzard the Chinese will take over
Seriously fuck Blizzard, fuck their games, fuck the people in charge
In fact, I'm entirely boycotting them (alongside a bunch of other companies for their pro-Beijing bullshit)
I will
I would be quite happy to pay a bit more for components made in Europe, fyi
China only punishes wealthy people who steps out of line or embarrasses Chinese rule
While here in the west, nearly all of them gets away with all that bullshit
They're testing us again to see how we'll react
They need to be locked out of NATO and other alliances because this kind of behaviour is unacceptable
We have nolikt karoti which means to put down the spoon
Y'all greet each other on a forest trail
Even in apartment buildings people mostly don't greet each other, except for maybe in villages where everybody knows everybody
Other than that in Latvia we have something similar - when someone is working outside, you say to them "God helps" ("Dievs palīdz
"), but you have to be at least acquainted to them to say that, too
How do you say the "Strength needed" part in Eesti keel
I have to disagree
We also have an independence day and restoration of independence
And we celebrate our freedom fighters on 11th November
Same shit man
Yes
And Estonians also celebrate independance and regaining of independence
It is a common trait in Baltics

at least in terms of space, furniture and architecture as that way you have a better grasp on their size comparatively to your body, that sort of thing
For math or physics it does complicate things a little bit
In Latvia, it's Latgale (Lettigallia), mostly because russians are in majority there
Latgale
They have their own language/dialect, most even more of the population is Russian than in Riga, and basically their own music, arts, cultural scene as well
Plus barely any Latgalians move to other parts of the country, even Riga
Every time I visit Daugavpils I feel like I'm in Irkutsk or Chelyabinsk, not in Latvia
Latgale / Letigallia
They speak a dialect that's barely intelligible and are predominately Russian Orthodox
Also, at the time of the Russian empire, they were more integrated within Russia being a part of the Pskov region
Plus they’re catholic unlike the rest of Latvia
Such a weird place
I did the same except I was leaving via Romania and they warned me in Transnistria that the guards on that border get funny about not having an entry stamp, so we went to Chisinau airport and explained to the first security guard we saw that we needed a stamp, and he took us back to the head of security's office; he then had to call the foreign ministry to get permission to give us stamps for coming in through Transnistria
Really weird experience
Or, as many outside of Finland say, Finland doesn't exist at all
But they have a right to bring their children up in Lithuania speaking only Russian and not Lithuanian, right
Same shit in Latvia
Same in Latvia
There was actually a burger restaurant (can't remember the name but I think you have a few of them
) Owned by Lithuanians that opened up in Riga last summer, but instead of hiring local staff they brought up staff from Vilnius and ended up getting a load of fines because customers complained to police that staff could only speak Russian or English, not Latvian
We used to have ministry of E-affairs, which ultimatelly was merged into, along with other things
The ministry of enviorment and regional development, VARAM for short, which just happens to stand for "we can" in Latvian, they're website  lists everything they can on the right hand side, but suffice to say, you might never have expected that you would need to call for tech support to ministry of the enviroment, which is curently very busy with redrawing borders of our regions
Also I find it funny that one of our spy agencies is called Constitution Protection Bureau
Whenever i went to žalgiris basketball games i’d be amazed at how everyone would sing the anthem at the start
Like usually 5-7
Sour and green ones
Cheap ones
Red and big ones, one costs almost euro
I think it's some kind of overcompensation
The Russians I know who are really bad at English tend to omit articles way too much
So I suppose that when they get better at English they compensate by overdoing it
More like
do sex
Yes we do it's called "pupiņu valoda" or "bean language" in english and it's pretty much the same as youre  "bird language" except instead of V we use the letter P
Example ka iet
(how's it going)--->kapa iepiet
(hopo's' ipit gopoiping)
Exactly the same here, idk why
We call it "bean language" (bean = pupa in Latvian
I wish the Nazis and Soviets would have respected my country’s neutrality in WW2, historians estimate about ⅛-1/6 of Latvia’s population was lost
Also this would mean there would be no Soviet occupation, and so Latvia would have kept its prosperity and wealth, and wouldn’t be just a post soviet mediocre country
Ich will in der Zukunft in Deutschland leben
Ich immer noch lerne die Sprache, und deshalb mache viele Fehler
Aber kannst du bitte mir beschreiben, wie es ist, dort zu Leben
Wealthfare model from the Nordic countries and a stable nordic government with no corruption and a vision for the future
I'm disappointed brialukai
EE food > Southern European food
Kyllä! Unfortunately Latvia is still too corrupt and poor for that
In Latvia it’s definitely [Riga Black Balsam]
Rīgas balzāms, its a balsam, as the name suggests and many say it tastes like cough syrup
It's called balsam here
It's a herbal liquor that's quite bitter, but sugary at the same time
A couple of years ago black currant and cranberry flavored variations came out
Personally, I dislike it, however it's good to "spice up" mulled wine during the winter season
Black balsam, I would recommend the black currant one, it's amazing
I once drank pinecone gin and it did taste like pinecone and grass
As I began to study and understand it from a young age, it seems very simple to me, but I definitely understand people, who find it difficult to learn
In school, we also study German, and I don’t understand a single word
As far as languages go, it's the easiest
It may be hard if you try to build on what you know already, apply the logic and structures of your native language but that only makes it harder
If you treat it as its own thing which does mean different sentence structures, different word order at times, etc
and don't try to force it into something it's not, it's not hard
Plus, it can take so much abuse before it becomes unintelligible and most people are already used to various accents so even if you're bad, at least you'll be understood, even if all you know are a handful of nouns and present tense verbs
My native language is Russian and I consider English to be by far the easiest language to learn out of all languages that I encountered
It has very simple grammar (no gender, no cases, fixed word order), and that allows anyone with a dictionary and time to understand everything
And understanding language is the only way that languages are learned
Elon Musk is an African American
Ķelne (Latvian) = Cologne
Country is called UK
Nationality is called British
These are the official terms used by Govt
People from N.Ireland are British, and live in UK
1€ 1L of milk
Price varies 0,7-1,3 depending on brand and a shop
10€ A good meal in a bistro (self service) type restaurant
If there's no fish then also plus a peace of cake
Or 2 meals at Mac Donald's.
100€ Diesel fuel for a car full tank
60-70€. Car insurance 30€ for 1-3 moths depending on experience, points etc
I bet you can buy at least a day's worth in Finland, too; more if you're frugal
Lunch buffet implies eating out
At first they were blocky all-caps printed letters, while you learned to actually read
Then it was only cursive
Imo, cursive is so much more faster to write
We learned to write in cursive
That being said, school was the only place where I used that skill
I went to a school with all sorts of European languages, but I attended the French courses, and they taught us cursive as our first way of writing, I write in cursive by default, it’s actually quite hard to write in “printed-like” for me
Cursive, I don't think they ever taught block letters, I learned myself from my mom's writing style
We learnt cursive and then moved to the UK and no one could read my handwriting because they cnt read cursive
I find that in the current year, learning cursive is pointless for most people
Education is one of the very few areas where people still routinely write by hand (and I consider that a waste of time)
Once I graduated college, I haven't written a single full sentence on paper, all I ever did was fill and sign forms
99% of text I write is on a keyboard
I don't like typing on touchscreens, though that'll do in a pinch
>So you never scribble down notes in a meeting
If I had to regularly attend meetings, I'd bring a laptop for that
>or write a shopping list
Most of the time I order groceries online since I hate walking around supermarkets searching for stuff I need
If I need to make a shopping list, I'll write one in google keep when I'm on PC and then look at it from my phone
>or pen a message to your mum
If I need some information relayed by text, I'll send her a whatsapp message
>or put some talking points on a whiteboard
Print letters seem more appropriate for that case
Besides, whiteboards are more useful for drawing diagrams than bullet points
I have always hated writing and reading cursive, and I will avoid it in all cases where there are viable alternatives
I can't think of any instance where cursive is actually better for any useful purpose besides instances where you are forced to write on paper due to some archaic processes that can't be done electronically
I might have had a different opinion if not for the seething hate for cursive I acquired due to being forced to write useless shit in school
This was around 20 years ago, but our Italian tour guide told us to avoid the restaurants that were packed with Japanese and American tourists
Could be
Lots in Latvia as well so I assume places like Rome and Florence must be absolutely flooded with tourists
By the way, that advice brought us down two blocks and to a small family place where the wife/mother cooked and brought us dishes in her slippers
Awesome meal
I find the idea kinda repulsing
Like the long tentacles with the suction cups and their mushy, wobbly heads
ugh no, thanks
But then again I squirm at the idea of most seafood
I do like regular fish but eating stuff like shellfish, octopus/squid etc
for some reason seems disgusting to me
Japanese takoyaki (something like fried dumplings with octopus inside) are the best
Shame that in Latvia it is impossible to find octopus of the same quality
If I was offered a job in the US with high income net of living expenses, I'd be willing to work for 5-10 years and then use the money to retire in Europe
I would not more to US permanently, because there are way too many dealbreakers and annoyances
Well, we call all countries differently in out language, at least with a different pronunciation, but here are some of the most different ones that come to mind
Finland - Somija
United States of America - Amerikas savienotās valstis
Germany - Vācija
Estonia - *cough* Igaunija *cough*
Russia - Krievija
New Zealand - Jaunzēlande
Belarus - Baltkrievija
Croatia - Horvātija
Sweden - Zviedrija
Switzerland - Šveice
Hungary - Ungārija
Germany--Tyskland
WTF
How did Latvia became THAT
Putting flags next to country named : Cool
Putting Latvian flag instead of Austrian flag :
I'm pretty sure that Lituanie is Lithuania and Latvia is Letonie
We've altered it a bit more - it's Somija
That's interesting
Thank you for the info
cough cough because I've always found it weird how we call Estonia Igaunija
I believe we took the name  Igaunija from [Ugannians]
I really don't know either
I've checked this [wiki] which might explain a bit, but it seems that there's an unclear origin
How do you call Latvia in Finnish
It is indeed surprising
I assumed the Russians have their own equivalent of Bureau International des Poids et Mesures, except with all measurements based not on a block of cesium but on a 700ml bottle of vodka
I suppose [Lāčplēsis] slayer) is the national epic that every one knows  and has to read it and is important to Latvian culture
Less availability of a varied amount of things to grow in the cold weather
However, I'd also say there's an East/West divide there too, a great part of that reason being that the Nazis and Soviets tried to stamp a lot of it out and exterminated the arts and culture scene in a lot of areas - cooking included
Latvian: Svētā Romas impērija
Russian: Священная Римская империя
Kārlis Ulmanis here
And then some of us say that we love democracy and dictatorship is shit
Smh
Yup
Climate change denial and belief in homeopathy seem to be the biggest recurring themes, though the "5G gives you cancer" made a big splash a couple months ago
Latvians are pretty superstitious in general so any bs like this has pretty fertile ground to grow in
Antivaxx I haven't heared here but some individuals there will be always
There is one latvian guy who is almost in every comment section science related, talking about flat earth
He also has a lot of content on youtube about it
But I don't think there are more like him
Almost no one denies climat change
But we have a lot of people against 5g internet
There are huge latvian facebook groups about it
Well, WWI enabled us to have foreign relations, and WWII disabled that particular feature for 50 years, so yeah
I'm sure it did, we didn't.
Voice pitch gets higher for some reason
Yes
It's easier to be funny
Our flexible word order and declension/conjugation grammar leaves very little room for language based jokes, e.g. puns, homonyms, unexpected word order, etc
Also, it's easier to put a finer point on things
There's a larger vocabulary in English so you can be more precise with your choice of words
Well, language that has different concepts that your own about very general and common things may change something about the way we express and reflect on our own points (we don't think "in a language", but once we involve speaking into analysis of thoughts), like in this example:  [
Little, but has and depends on personality :) Some people do depend on the feedback and perception of others, so, if such person use more gestures and and other non-verbal things speaking another language, they  may receive another feedback and start reflect on themselves differently
Basically, most national and ethnic traditions/culture are common because they based on the same concepts shared by common language
Think of it as of "national personality" and it's part of every member
Once this member has to replace the first language with another it does affect the way person behaves in its own brain at list
The world is theater and men and women are merely players
We have specific language and behavior codes for home, work, friends, authorities, etc
It may be tiny, but still affects identity and personality
We may even have different concepts about what does make a personality and what shall be considered as a change to it :)  Let's just assume you have independent and stiff personality
You definitely have some stiffness, that's making talking to you a pleasure, btw
Ok, maybe you started talking English in early age and it's feels more natural to you
Or something else
I feel like I'm playing some unexpected guessing game for some reason
Which one is deep fried Mars bars
My step sister did the same thing - moved to France after higschool
She lives next to Paris and has 2 kids with a french guy, so no way she will ever return back to LV
But, atleast I got to see Paris, while visiting her few years ago
κάτι τρέχει στα γύφτικα
In german: Du bist eine kleine schweine
In Estonian: Sittu ruttu, karu tuleb
The meaning should be "S*it faster, the bear is coming

Holy shit, I remember these
It was like driving in fridge during winter
We still have them

[This] guy who had the audacity to perform a song in russian for Latvia
He himself isn't even russian, and the song is not that good
I don't remember which year this was but I'm still mad and fail to see the reasoning behind this decision
Such an embarassment
Yeah but we don't really identify with the russians or the russian language, there's just a lot of "latvian-on-paper" russians due to historical reasons
So I still think it's at least a little bit disrespectful
I have nothing against russians as an ethnic group (russophobia), I just find it a little offensive when russians, born and raised in Latvia, don't speak a word in latvian, act like they own the place and get angry at me for not understanding russian
So sorry, if I'm taking the act discussed above a little personally
At first latvia fought for the Russian empire against the Germans, since the eastern front was pretty much right next to Latvia, so it was a defending the homeland type of thing, but then the Soviets started their revolution, and then Latvia fought for its independence
So now we celebrate the soldiers whose lives were thrown into the meat grinder (by the tsar) that was the eastern front of WW1, and we celebrate the soldiers that defended Latvias newfound independence from Germans and Russians
But I don’t think we use poppies to do that
In Latvian it was already called Čehija, Czechia is no different
So I shouldn't mind it at all
But I do, I can't get myself to day Czechia at all
Same for Latvian
Everyone just says Čehija, not Čehijas Republika
I prefer LSSR flag
looks like the flag of the united baltic duchy
In Latvian envy is skaudība and jealousy - greizsirdība (literally crooked-heartedness)
Finance/legal/accounting - London
Theatre/Opera/Orchestra - London
Paldies (LV), Paļdis (Latgalian), Ačiu (Lithuanian), Спасибо (Russian), Kiitos (Finnish), Tak (Danish/Swedish/Norwegian), Dankeschön (German), Denk u val (Dutch), Merci (French/Romanian), Gracias (Spanish), Obrigado (Portuguese), Grazie (Italian), Hvala (Croatian/Slovenian/Bosnian/Serbian/Montenegro), Я благодарю (Bulgarian), Köszönom (Hungarian), Džekuje (Polish/Slovakian/Czech)
That’s 26 including English I think
I’m not sure on Belarus or Ukraine, and I don’t know in Estonian, Albanian, Luxembourgish, Turkish or Greek - or a lot of the smaller regional languages
And before anyone wants to get pedantic - I know Finnish, Hungarian, Turkish, and Estonian aren’t “technically” European languages
Included them because of geography
English, Estonian, French, German, Latvian, Lithuanian, Russian, Ukrainian
Could recognize “thanks” in a few more but don’t know by heart
Ah madloba, I remember that one now
A music group called "Singapūras satīns" from my country
Investing in Eastern Poland
Complaining that whoever’s cooking on the barbecue is doing it wrong
It’s like a national summer pastime
We have "Who owns the state".
It's really weird, cuz before elections they were leading un polls, but now they're smallest party supported just by 1%.
Turkey probably
No, we dont have these
But to be fair, most people dont talk or make much noise in their commute anyways
So, there is not really a need for it
Also our trains are quite loud themselves when accelerating and braking
honestly for me (Latvian) the favourite city for me would be Pļaviņas cause it just has such a lovely atmosphere
Riga, but to be more specific, the Pardaugava part of the city
(Riga is geographically separated in two parts by the Daugava river
Hence Pardaugava means “over the Daugava river”)
Cēsis or Kuldīga for me
Some of the most funny memes I have seen in my life were Latvian
The one popular with non natives are the potato memes
Honestly they aren't funny, at least for latvians
We have kind of weird, cursed memes, often very dark humor
But sometimes its low quality, shit joke, bad grammar, etc
(almost r/okbuddyretard shit
But unironical
) We have a lot of "cursed"(mostly bad) boomer humor that is shared on facebook or local social network for boomers -draugiem
I don't think the ingredients are much of a problem, most of them can be found everywhere these days
What really irks me is the measurements - not even ounces and pounds, those can be converted but fucking cups as a measurement
Is it weight, is it volume
Is it the mythical "standard" cup, or just a mug you have laying around somewhere
Over here oyster sauce is widely available in the Asian section in any semi-decent store
For me, it was at 4th grade when we first went to Aiport of Riga (RIX) and after that, we went to  Līvu aquapark in Jurmala forest of the day (4 or 5 hours I reckon)
And after that, we went to McDonald's or some pizza restaurant (I don't remember it well)
The school but the kids probably learn stuff from friends before that
The fact that the closest linguistic relatives to your language are Finns and Estonians is a little more outlandish
> In 1933 Bukh publicly expressed his allegiance to the National Socialist cause and its aim of improving the health of the Aryan race through gymnastics
He really puts the Aryan in yoga
I consider myself to be Latvian who just happened to get Russian as my first language
If my ancestors ended up in a bit different place before the end of WW2, it is possible I'd speak either German or Finnish as my first language, so I don't feel tied to Russia in any way
People there are nice tho, at least the ones I've met
And fantasy books written by Russian authors are so good
It's a shame many of them don't have English translation
On 31 December 1600, the Queen granted a Royal Charter to "George, Earl of Cumberland, and 215 Knights, Aldermen, and Burgesses" under the name, Governor and Company of Merchants of London trading with the East Indies
Later became the Honourable East India Company
Maybe Poland would take it
Not all of these are cities and towns per se but here it goes
Nereta
Akenstaka
Mercendarbe
Raiskums (also others ending with "-ums" such as "Tukums", "Ķegums")
Koknese (Translates to "Wood bearer")
Lielvārde (Translates to "Great name", its historic name: "Rembate")
Kolka (Name derives from Livonian "Kūolka" which means "corner")
Rēzekne (I prefer the sound of Russian: Режица)
Ludza (I prefer the sound of Russian: Люцин)
Ramata
Trikāta
Tiskādi (these 3 have a hard sound to them which sort of encapsulates the essence of Latvian language)
Kūkas (literally: "cakes", however, in a dialect it means "spirits of the bog")
Kaldabruņa (to me this name sounds like the name of an old lady)
Eķengrāve
Ēdole
Vīgante (aka Staburags)
Olaine
Stāmeriena
Jersika
Normally these names are written in English the same way, sometimes the diacritic marks are dropped
This is sometimes anecdotal, as is the case with the town of "Ogre".
Quite popular in New Zealand
And fair interest in Australia
Also smaller countries eg Fiji
not popular here at all
we have to learn basically every sport in school pe but we don't have to learn rugby
i have never met a person who knows how to play it
Yes, milk definetly would go bad faster in warmer conditions, not sure about eggs
Maybe France mainly has UHT milk that has no bacteria that could spoil it in it while unopen
Depends
If one buys fresh milk or non UHT, you have to put it in a fridge and drink fast
I always buy both one fresh and one UHT
Big family
But I refridgarate both, it's conveniet
Everything in one palce
The same for eggs
I can buy washed (expensive) or not washed (cheaper)
I refridgerate both
It's conveniet, everything in one place
QWERTY & ЙЦУКЕН
EN - LV - RU
QWERTY
If you want to type a special character, press ' before typing the normal letter - typing in 'c results in č, for example
if you want a ' then press space after typing it in
In latvia, we have the regular qwerty keyboard, but for letters like ā, š or ļ ect
by pressing either ' or ` before a, s or l ect
All other Romes were run by little girls
Wait 15 languages
Fluently
How does she maintain practice in so many
Well, does she speak Latvian
I mean, idk, depends on situation how I would compliment my girlfriend and nothing springs to mind
I guess "ej tu skaista meitene" is a popular one, meaning "hey you beautiful girl", but it's a line from a really famous Latvian punk song (think Latvia's version of The Clash) so it might be a bit weird if she doesn't know the song, lol
I don't know how to explain it in english  but my city's mayor did some stuff he wasn't supposed to do so like half the politicians are against him
Most of his accounts are blocked and everyone is trying to get him to like step down from mayor but can't because he has good connections
I love this comment
I've never seen anyone consider it "not-healthy", but I've never seen anyone consider it "healthy" either
2 - Struve Geodic arc and old town of Riga
Not much, but  the old town is really something
From Latvia to Lettland, since we were called like that before WW2
And it does sound more westernic not with slavic -ia ending
It's Horvātija in Latvian
Romania sounds like a mania of ro, whatever ro is
Which one
We get really confused with Lithuania which has ia ending either
Yeah, Lettland and Estland, but then people'd get confused
Why do Finns calls Lietuua just like in Latvia expect we call Lietuva
In Latvian too
Exactly the same for my husband
Whenever news hit that Germans are, for example, not so willing to have their vaccine my husband stares at TV in disbelief saying - not the Germans too, they are the most civil country and even they are turning
yeah, the system is very chaotic but i think the most popular surnames end with -iņš -iņa (diminutive) and are weirdly very nature based
Lithuania: We're brothers
Estonia: The kid who came to play with us at the playground and pretends we're still friends
Belarus: It's easy to forget they border us
I have no idea what goes on in there
Russia: The most threatening, but I doubt that they'll do anything to us, because we're in NATO
I apolagise about this, I don't know what our government is thinking
Course we are, it just seems you crush on Finland a bit too much
They claimed they love potatoes more than us, we couldn't just not do anything
(Actually though it was a joke, Latvia and Belaurs; and the people of these 2 nations are very chill with each other)
12-13th century, during the northern crusade
Many wars were fought between the Baltic tribes and the German crusaders, and I think it could be very interesting
Or WW1 when Latvia fought for its independence from first the Russian empire, then the Germans, then the Soviets, and then the remnants of the destroyed German army, all in the span of 2 years
Or WW2 when Latvia was invaded By Soviets, and then Nazis, and then Soviets again, all the while partisan groups fought against both of them, I think if an AC game were to happen then, the assassin would be a forest brother partisan
In Latvia it would be interesting to take place during the singing revolution, 1986 - 1991
It would probably be about fighting against the soviets to make Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia independent again
YES, it's like the advent but instead of lighting a candle each Sunday we watch Home Alone each Friday
Yes has been for many years now
>all 3
There are five
Just wanted to mention the same here haha
I agree, I haven't even watched 4 and 5, still if someone thinks there are 3, there are 5
We have [Urlas]
Also gopniks, and 12 year old gangsters going around with scooters
Some words are the same but mostly i dont understand the other languages
I can understand maybe one in 10 words in Lithuanian
Russians
Pretty common here
A lot of schools before a few years ago taught primarily in Russian, until they passed a law declaring all schools had to be at least 50% in Latvian
It’s pretty common for a few subjects to be taught in English outside of English or American school, and in my fiancées school she even had a few subjects in French also
Plus when I went to school in UK I noticed that the resources for teaching languages are extremely limited because of the tendency to rely on people speaking English
For example, I was taught “wo ist die Bahnhopf bitte
” but not how to understand where the train station is
And I went to a school that taught 5 languages as options, so I can’t imagine how bad it must be in a school that can barely source a French teacher
I’m pretty sure there’s an island in Estonia almost exclusively populated by the Sàmi
Castle and palace both translate to "pils".
The only oned i can think of At the top of my head is “Mēnesis” which means both moon and month, And “bise” which is  supposed to mean shotgun, but I’ve heard people use it to mean rifle
Jauns means both new and young
But they don't really just use "owl" to refer to both animals, each is a different kind of owl, e.g. a horned owl or a wood owl, it's just that there's a single base name for the whole order of animals
In comparison we have not just two but three different base words for owl species - apogs, ūpis un pūce (apogs would be a kind of buho in Spanish
That's in a lot of languages
Same here, Pūce, Ūpis, Apogs; Krauklis un Vārna
The Baltic countries also speak English very well, that is people who are native speakers, not Russians
I think this is mainly due to the reason that there's not much information or entertainment in our own languages, so you have to learn English
This is definitely where I got my English skills from
A friend of mine pronounced queue as "kveevoo".
Ireland
Songs, music, beer, drinking, potatoes, emigration, oppression by a neighboring empire and its yoke thrown off in 1918, and a bloody struggle to do it
There's Ogre, Ape and Madona
We have a town called Ogre
Very unfortunate name for such a beautiful place
Ogre
Just Ogre
[Serious] What is the worst tragedy to happen in your country because of human error or just because someone ignored simple safety rules
Colapse of Maxima supermarket in Riga
It was a tragedy, that happened on 21
November 2013
The roof of the store colapsed killing 54 people
I was in Wales a month ago for a wedding
The bride's father was going to that school, and was ill at the time
An entire generation lost like that is a fucking mess
Especially in Wales, where, from what I've been told, everyone in the valleys know each other
So the entire southern Wales knew someone whose kid died in that
The train crash really pissed me off "Oh we'll be three minutes and few people will be angry
I know
Let's go 160 mph instead of 80
What could possibly go wrong
Isn't this the same fire where that Romanian rock band died
Eh, Hindenburg hardly had a choice from what I understand
Honestly I'll never forget where I was and what was I doing when I first heard the news about it
Goes like this mostly: " so you live in Russia
" Or "Your capital is Vilnus right
Either “what is that
” Or “is that in Russia
Do you speak Russian
Literally always happens
In Latvia 3 times: somewhere in November, then on 1st of December (we had hope that snowy winter have started) and on 2nd of January a little bit
We still have hope, because for the last 10 years winter kinda shifted for 1-2 month for us
Some years February - April were very snowy
Even once or twice we had snow in May
We had like 3 separate days/nights of snow
IT'S NOT ENOUGH, very weird this year
Well i did see some snow but no longer than half a day
At like early November there were a few places with a bit of snow but soon after it vanished
barely, a bit in december and exactly one night this month (and it melted in less than a day)
we had more snow in november than december and january combined
It's been around
Personaly something showing up in TV shop is strong reason to never consider buying it - everything in those ads seems so gimmicky, stupid and overpriced
Hoping for that Olympics bronze medal at midnight
Are we considered
Territory is the same as Ireland, but more than twice as less in population
And that's basically the main advantage and disadvantage in the same time
I really don't know, but I really like how Estonian sound
Our prime minister was born in US, but he is latvian iirc
History teacher said that Prussia existed before 16th century
We call it the star day and it's the last day to get your Christmas tree out of the house
Nothing else is celebrated
Why fireworks were forbidden
Glad that the Irish didn't understand him as well :D
What about that Michiel de Ruyter film
I know it's not current, and it probably doesn't count as a foreign movie about the Netherlands but it seemed somewhat international, production-wise
There is a TV show, though - [Patriot] It's quite good, if you're into that kind of black humor and comedy of errors
Also, I think it was fairly honest about foreign locales, with comedic exaggerations, of course
It does exist
To the best of my knowledge, Welshmen want to eat people's livers with fava beans and Chianti
Oh, and sing about pussycats
Mine, too, and I'm not even any of the nationalities portrayed
Completely agree about Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, one of the rare cases where Hollywood gets it right; The Girl in the Spider's Web (movie) was straight up trash, though
(To be honest, in my opinion, the post-Larsson books are, too, Spider's Web especially, like some shitty Tom Clancy fanfiction set in Sweden
5th and 6th aren't as bad
Well, there’s also a small man in a box
Well I don't know why for many it's viewed as cheap
Look  at other stores
You can definitely buy cheaper furniture in other stores
For sure I can name overpriced stuff
Beds and kitchen systems are way too expensive and doesn't justify prices
IKEA for me is a place where I can go safely with my kids and shop at the same time, and a place where I can get everything for home without running around other 50 stores in my city
Pretty much the same here, except it’s more the go-to for furniture and supplies but not luxury, and we have only one in the country
If Eesti can be of Scandinavia, what abouts Latvias
As long as base is used for NATO operations I'm fine, apart from that I would not want them anywhere near
Awww yis Latvia represent
Nope
And most of "polish groceries" here are called "local groceries".
Poland is like China of Europe when it comes to groceries, as such it's usually branded goods by multinational cooperations or unprocessed agricultural products that are imported from Poland without advertising the fact much (there was a funny video several years ago, where salespeople at market claim everyone has Polish strawberies, except for them)
We don't have Polish cuisine products usually
There's polish sections in tesco evert ere and there's many Polish shops
And Heroes, too
Actually, this is one of rare cases where the audiobook version is preferable - it's Stephen Fry himself reading, and he could read a phonebook and make it engrossing, let alone these books
Mid 1930s, the golden age of latvia before WW2, or 1200, to witness the northern crusades and to see if I can understand any of the languages spoken by the Latvian tribes
Learned Swedish anthem inspired by a Volvo ad starring Zlatan, but the main motivation behind it was to get 10 in my uni class
Also know parts of USSR/Russian anthem due to the fact that it's so catchy
By having more than 2 potatoes
In Latvia it’s the opposite but I grew up in UK where they do it the same as you, so I use them interchangeably without realising it, to the annoyance of everyone else
I use a comma for decimal separators and a space as a thousand separator but I don't know if that's a widespread practice :D
My favourite joke goes like this: (it's not about the current leader tho, haven't heard any about him)
When Vaira Vīķe-Freiberga (first female president) was elected people thought: Ohh, look, a female can be a president too
When Valdis Zatlers (a doctor by profession) was elected people thought: Look, anyone can be a president
When Andris Bērziņš was elected people though: Ohh, we don't even need a president
Or a dog
It's Budapešta in Latvian, so with *sh* (since that's what *š* is) :)
In Latvian it’s ‘Budapešta’. The caron above the ‘s’ makes it an sh sound
Ok so I already know 2 languages fluently so I would definitely want to learn German, Korean and Japanese
German cause I am learning it at school and that would make it way easier for me, Korean cause I like K-pop and want to move to Korea or at least visit Korea at some point in my life and japanese cause I want to move there as well and also cause one of my friends is learning Japanese and I would be able to help him
We removed all USSR monuments as fast as we got our independence
It's all right, wouldn't say it's anything great, in Ventspils
Most of the sidewalks have bike lanes, but they're not really designed around the bike, more put there because there was a sidewalk, so it got widened and a bike lane added
My mum's been getting by on the bike and hasn't been run over by a car yet, so that's good
Really wholesome, until one of my drunk uncles brings up politics
Well, all my grandparents are dead and I don't have any uncles/aunts/cousins/siblings, so family gathering is whenever I visit my mom, I guess
It's pretty chill, we might drink a glass of wine or whip up some cocktail and talk about stuff or watch something together (unless I'm there to help her out with, say, renovations and alike)
(I do have a few not-so-close relatives, but I haven't met them in more than a decade, tbh)
~~Four twenty nineteen~~ Four twenty ten nine

Krišjānis Valdemārs (one of the starters and leader for the young Latvian movement (first Latvian awakening) )
Krišjānis Barons (one do the starters for the young Latvian movement and know as "Father of dainas"(Dainu tēvs) organized and systemized pretty much all dainas in Latvia hence the name)
Juris Alunāns ( one of the starters of the young Latvian movement  created the foundation for modern latvian, created new Latvian words and degermanized the language)
Jānis Čakste (first president of Latvia)
Zigfrīds Anna Meierovics (first foreign minister and second prime minister of Latvia)
Kārlis Ulmanis (leader of the provisional government , prime minister and dictator of Latvia and last leader pre ww2)
Now historical figures who aren't Latvian but are still widely known in the nation
Jēkabs Ketlers (duke of Kurzeme and Zemgale established colonies and knew Latvian)
Gabriel Merkel (prominent esto and latvophile wrote the book "latvietis")
For Latvia:

* [Jacob Kettler]
* [Jānis Čakste]
* [Aspazija]

You need to add a double line break (press Enter twice) for reddit to actually move it to the next line
Reddit's formatting is weird
You could also put a " * " before each name (after a double line break) and it would look like this:

* Item 2
Yea  sorry about that wrote that on my phone, thanks
No, over here they're generally famous for peeing on every public landmark and monument
Nope but they've been known to piss on Monument of Freedom, running around drunk and naked, and starting fights in McDonald's in Latvia
"Oh, it's nothing special," our then finance minister in 2008 about the deepening Great Recession
Such a great country, loved your montains, it's so cheap, it was 50 Euros for a 5 star hotel for 1 night, absolutely astounding, although you did have lots of power lines, like SO MANY
It's also really hot and you have 24/7 stores everywhere
It's amazing
They're illegal in my country
Yes, this, absolutely this
You know, I don't remember it that vividly but I can still relate even if it wasn't that specific spot
A castle built by the Knights of the Livonian Order overlooking the port of Ventspils
My town of Dobele, Latvia has a castle ruins either
Currently it's under construction since they're building museum in it

It's Āmurs
Might be used as a way describing an idiot
Latvian it's "āmurs" for the normal ones and for the big ones it's "veseris"
Interesting
In Latvian it's "veseris" for a large hammer
Latvian, too
But there is also “veseris,” probably from the same root, which does mean a large hammer
To be fair I think the history teachers are a bit biased, they do teach us to hate Russians in a way
Don't get me wrong, the things they did are unforgivable, we're still recovering as a country, an economy and probably will be for the next 100 years or more
I do get the hate Russians receive
That said, I believe we can co-exist with the right laws in place in our country, like learning Latvian mandatory
My grandma is very nostalgic but she is also not a very bright person, the Soviet era taught her how to survive without anything and how to preserve the food you've got
She likes how she lives, if I was her I would be miserable
Ah, fuck I could write down contents of history book as others have allready tried - if you care to know an entire year is dedicated to 20th century in elementery and then again in high school in a very analytical, matter of fact way - but the truth is that "Soviet" stands for everything that ever could be wrong with the world, even if someone has found memories about some features, they would never want that era to return and if someone actually does they're going to be an outcast in our society
I get your Grandma thing
My mom (in her mid 60's) has a serious hording problem
And most of the stuff she hoards is old Soviet junk nobody will ever use again - old, but never used sheets (that once used to be white, but now are yellowish), old plates, glasses and God knows what else are in those cupboards, that has not seen the daylight in more than a decade
Me and the brothers are always trying to convince her to throw out or give away at least some of that junk
But no - what if someone some day might need it
She somehow doesent get the concept, that it is really easy to get hold of those things nowdays and there is literally no reason to cluter your apartment for "mabey someday".
It's not as cheap and filled with strip clubs and prostitutes as it was 5-10 years ago
There is actually a rest of the country that is worth seeing outside of Rīga
Or Soviet Russia for us
It's not gay if the balls don't touch
First time I heard of a spelling bee was probably on Simpsons or some other kids’ show
In high school I actually participated in one
It was in English, however, because Latvian is a relatively phonetic language
Everyone seemed to have a lot of fun
No such thing needed in Latvia, as every single word in Latvian is pronounced as it's written
We look at comments on the local news sites and the one with the most vile and hateful author is chosen as the de facto brown cardinal who occupies the mind of anyone living here
Even if you disagree with such garbage, you still get influenced by it in every day life
Officially, the 100 nerds assembled from a public popular vote pick a president then vote him in with a 51%. Then the president proposes a prime minister
Then the prime minister has the most de facto power
*It just works*
Kurzeme: Forests everywhere
Latgale: mini Russia in Latvia
Zemgale: do you even exist
Are you sure you're a real region
Vidzeme: 90% of the land is taken by national parks
Riga: First of all stop acting like you're a real region
Two, you're of fucking dicks
Bidet showers
Should be a law mandating those in every toilet
I'm more inclined to answer none
Habits are changing, yes
30 years after USSR i feel like Latvian traditions have become only stronger
For Latvia I would say that "Saule, Pērkons, Daugava" , this song is essentially our unofficial second anthem, some people prefer it to the anthem
Agreed
Was looking whether someone had already posted this
Yeah, but that was direct action from the central government, I'd bet that it's not an action that the federal government of the EU would take
The federalisation itself is not in question right now, this is a discussion that came up from some people's arguments against it
As for independence, what is it exactly
Yes, with the exception of language
Languages strongly influence how we think, and understanding a language is a necessary step to understanding the person speaking it, and are absolutely something worth preserving and studying
I think I love you
Would you care to elaborate
Your region, whichever one it is, has almost certainly been a country at some point
The dukes of France had almost as much independence as sovereign states, with the French king being the "first among equals", until eventually centralising around Paris
What is it I'm supposed to value more
Are we independent now
The existence of UKIP implies a lack of independence within the EU for the UK, and we're even deeper in it
Will the UK be independent after Brexit
True independence is impossible, because it would require a national self sufficiency
Only half of British food is made in the UK, according to [this chart
] Probably that percentage would increase, but not by that much
Is being dependent on other countries for your basic needs independence
u/stevothepedo Ireland does not have the resources for its 5 million people to be self sustaining, not without massive rebuilding of the entire country and losing a lot of the comforts that the people currently experience
The difference between being in a federal EU and a British empire, is that the EU sees you as an equal participant, not an unruly subject with the wrong religion, and is willing to provide aid should it be necessary
As well as having an actual say in what's going on, and the knowledge that you chose to enter the agreement without a foreign army knocking on your front door
I'm saying that independence is a meaningless word on its own
Context is needed

I believe it's called threshing barn in English and probaly it was pretty common, except maybe in hotter climates where they might have simply worked outside, it's just forgoten, because not all have special word for it and interest in historical heritage
Oh man o remember going mushroom picking with my grandmother and then making mushroom stew and sauce
What the hell is wrong with you
In Latvian, it's called "rija".
Come visit
You might be surprised
Different sorts of rye and wheat breads, as well some weirder stuff like oat bread
Though we maek our "sour bread" with honey and call it sweet-sour bread
> not fried here, it’s raw
Right
I'm out
Haven't seen anything like that, but Foogling it brings up some results
Fiskars mostly sells Garden tools here, though, I'd expect to buy them at construction and/or gardening supply store, not pharmacy
Not these exact scissors but most of my gardening tools are made by Fiskars
It has always been considered a staple of quality here
Here I've seen only kitchen scissors (my family has them) and special ones for gardening
I have exact same one, but in white colour
I just guess franca would really be lingua franca then
The Freedom Monument for sure is the symbol of Latvija
If a monument doesn’t count and it has to be a building, then probably the National Library is the only other really famous building we have, or Riga Central Market
Most people who come here would remember the Freedom Monument first though
As a foreigner who last visited Vienna 6 years ago, and other Austrian cities even longer ago than that, I would say the Hofburg or Karlskirche were the two buildings I associate most with Austria
I personally ride a road bike, I like that the bike is narrow, light (great for putting it on your shoulder when you need to climb stairs) and, most importantly, I think I look cool riding it
Unlike in Denmark or the Netherlands, bikes here are very varied, some people ride classic city bikes, some old and new road bikes or tourism bikes but quite a lot of people choose to ride a mountain bike, maybe due to our horrible roads
In Riga only daredevils ride on the road, or sometimes you just don't have another option, so we don't weave traffic and if you do you're seen as an asshole lawbreaker because cyclists are supposed to ride close to the edge of the road (with some exceptions)
Overall people ride on sidewalks, which is actually illegal, but as a cyclist I can say that most people are just too scared to ride on the road
Sadly, cyclist culture is not very developed here and somewhat looked down on, people see cyclists as annoying, the infrastructure is bad and not thought through
Really hope things will change because I think its a great way to move around and would fix many problems
Twice for Latvia:
1918-1040 - Independence from Russia after WW1
1991- now - The Soviet Union collapsing
I still have that image of Paris in my mind and I’m not going to Paris to keep it that way
True, as usual with the French, the liaison is hard to prevent
They must have mixed you up with Switzerland
We have the state police doing all the serious stuff everywhere + road traffic policing; and then in the cities there's municipal police taking care of drunks, minor hooligans, parking, stuff like that
There is a military police but it only handles matters internal to the military
We take it bit by bit
We have to learn Latvian and World history till 9th grade and then we repeat everything and go more in depth in high school
Came here to write exactly this
Not disappointed someone beat me to it
Let's also not forget that most countries only learn their own history as a nation state, and possibly in Europe medieval states as well
Nowhere in the world does any great depth of history in high school
Kids are too young and curriculums are too limited
Goddamit, turns out my Persian cat is actually Russian
Austria has this weird rule where a vignette purchased online can be valid only after 18 days (based on the EU rule that online purchases can be cancelled within 14 day period)
Why not use the digital purchase exceptions where a product/service can be provided during the cancellation period if the user is informed and agrees to opt-out of the 14 day cancellation period
I think he refers to safety requirements on the roads regarding using lights in the daytime
I doubt it's written down in any regulations, more like if you are polite towards the police officer, they're likely to let you off with a warning, in part maybe that it's more of a hassle writing up a ~~foreigner~~ fellow EU citizen for something trivial
Schuko does have grounding, it's the Europlug that has only two wires
You might be thinking of the fuse in the plug that Euro plugs don't have because of the breaker box

I guess the etymology is simile to pierogi but we bake them and they’re usually made with speck, onions, and lardons
I guess we also have pelmeņi, which are technically Russian, but we have our own variations which are, honestly, as good if not better than any пельмени I’ve had in Russia
It's a different kind of cheesecake, made with cottage cheese, drier and more crumbly
A good one is good on its own but in a bad one the raisins actually help to break up the texture and make it less dry

That being said, I would prefer one system of issue for all member states

For a bit there I wasn't really sure if you meant Mussolini or Berlusconi
Honestly, I'm still not completely sure
It's amazing how even Turks hate him and yet sadly there's nothing you can do about it
Probably Ivars Godmanis or Ainars Šlesers
The former was PM of the only parliament that has been dismissed by the President, and the latter's crimes and the parliaments refusal to permit a search of his property were the reason for said dismissal
Geez I remember watch the speech on TV where he dismissed the parliament and sitting in stun silence for good two minutes after it ended

It was like living on planned economics and common being over personal, if you're from a city or a town you were born most likely in maternity unit, went to nearest childrengarden, then in school, in USSR 2nd graders would be organized into Octobrist organization, from like fifth you'd be taken to Pioneers Youth organization with some ideological rituals, about 8th-10th grade you'd be proposed to enter Komsomol organization, which had specific requirements for your morals and deeds
If you had shown yourself as reliable comrade you'd be proposed to enter to the Communist party
For others it could be a specialization college or an Institute / University after which you'd be proposed with a job position sometimes even in another part of USSR
There was no unemployed people, moreover if you were caught in a working day on the street doing nothing  - you'd be checked for skipping the duties
After several skips you might get administrative due - money fine or public works
For kids it was fun at some point - we never knew anything different, toys, cartoons were the same for everyone from Baltics to China borders, parents were always employed, health care and education was for free, that is if we talk about 60s and beyond
I remember a story my uncle told me about how he sneaked all kinds of illegal items into USSR (Coke, Pepsi, Snickers, Twix) and risked the safety of this entire family because you could actually go to jail at that time if police found those items in your house
Or, if they actually did something, once faced with Western technology, standards and requirements, suddenly realized how useless all of their education or experience is
We had ketchup, but after like 1986
Before that we had tomato paste
Yeah, everybody had a shit job, shit housing, shit food and a small amount of useless money
Of course Mao was a big friend first, but later USSR slowly drifted from him, especially after demolishing personal cult of Stalin by Khrushchev in 60s.
Atrocities and death toll due to famine in China and near regions were huge and there were gossips in USSR about it, but that wasn't a topic for a small talk with friends
Such things usually were discussed whispering somewhere far from anyone and anything
Plus there were no reliable information sources, just some occasional radiotransmissions from the West and rare cases of individual contacts with Chinese who would want to share anything about it
Official position was "Unbreakable Chinese brothers are bravely fighting against exploitators and all types of degradation of humanity for our common enlighten future in Communism".
There were aspects that were maybe even good - much lower inequality, free education and healthcare, jobs for everyone - at the much too high cost of everything else
A large reason for low inequality was that no one had shit, education and healthcare was free and available to anyone, and also equally bad for anyone, and the economy was ultimately unsustainable
It was the same ideological system, while being Octobrist I was chosen as a head of our "star" (group of 5 kids, allusion to 5-pointed soviet red star - I tell you it was just like a sect from your day 1) and my duty was to organize our group to collect, store and pass money for the starving kids in African countries
We were writing letters to youngsters in another ideological-friendly countries (never had a chance to write to GDR, though) and even receiving replies
A bunch of activities and even more after becoming the pioneer: activity groups of any kind - sports, nature patrol, helping workers and farmers, building radio out of a pencil, wire and a couple of transistors, granade throwing, hikes to god knows where
I also was a school newspaper guy at some point, but for a couple of months only
Jesus, it was crazy
> it wasn't any kind of Stalinist oppression
Because it wasn't. When people think about communism, they think the USSR or Warsaw Pact, and compared to that, Yugoslavia was a paradise
That part of older generation that looks back on it fondly do it because that's when they were young and everything is better when you're young
Sometimes, it just a habit now

There are lots, but my favourite is:"Sit dirsu pret zemi
" It basically means hit your ass against the ground and is said in situations when a person doesnt want to eat or wear something
For example
Person 1:"Here i made you an omelette". Person 2: "I dont want it
" Person 1: "Tad sit dirsu pret zemi
Haha that's dope

Riga
The city center is completely safe
The large commie block outskirts might be a different story, but the most you'd risk there would be a mugging
Yes, the trejdeksnis, as portrayed in the comedy TV series Community episode "Conspiracy Theories and Interior Design":
According to wikipedia, that appearance is also about its only claim to international fame:
"Ass" which means "sharp"
"Nazis" which means "knife"
so a "sharp knife" is "ass nazis"
There one that comes to mind
Just means feel
Glāze : cup
Ass in Latvian means sharp or axis
Hate
I love'em
Here in Latvia you could get a luxury apartment the size of a regular house in an exclusive living area, a nice ~250-400 square meters house in a fancy area, or a semi run down ~900 m2 house in an average/shabbier area
You could get a building roughly 400 m2 in size in the very center of the town
You can probably buy the whole town with that kind of money where I'm from
Ofc those 900m2 houses are, for the most part, without any furniture, technologies, other furnishings, there's often no running water or electricity, the walls or floors may be caving in in some rooms etc
So yeah, they're basically like those abandoned houses people would go to explore, and it would probably cost 3x as much to make it livable (and most likely already was/would be turned into an apartment building)
In Latvian the ladybug is usually called bizbizmārīte, which could be literally translated as 'buzz buzz little Mary

Gender reassignment surgery
Latvia and dark bluejeans
Jeans and ,not sure if this counts, the Christmas tree
The guy who invented jeans moved to America and invented them with the help of some American dude
Jeans and the Christmas tree
Well, not in Latvia, but Latvian-born immigrant Jacob Davis invented jeans and then partnered with Levi Strauss to mass produce them
But that was already in America
Does it count
Jeans and citric-acid
also JEANS
One of the biggest rivers in Latvia is called "Lielupe" - big River
It flows into the sea next to a city called "Jūrmala" - seaside
Don't forget Newport
Wait, actually, do forget Newport
I would also add some places that have jaun- (new) added to the names
For example there is Mārupe and Jaunmārupe
Jaunpils is the weirdest of those for me
I have a few friends around South Wales, mostly Merthyr
They all say Newport should be avoided like the plague
in resturants yes
at home no because we don't have any
Knowing how crazy pizza gets in France, Sweden and even Italy, we have very traditional pizza with nothing special added and no dipping sauces
I'm guessing Iceland
That con is why I love Germany
No need to waste time beating around the bush, when you could just be direct
If you think they're assholes you're weak, they're simply efficient
Blackout curtains
Even IKEA has a wide selection
I know
Just like Germans
I like it
It's efficient
It's better
There's nothing bad about it
Yes, I know quite well what it's like, we're on the same latitude as South of Sweden
To be honest, as a late riser, I quite like it but I see why some might not
Not having those dark winters would be even better, though
Yeah, I also really like the Russian anthem musically
It’s not something Latvians would shout about though, for obvious reasons
Geopathology and dowsing is a big thing here
Like I've seen even supposedly rational people back that shit
Something like ley lines but that there's water in them and that it radiates some mystical energy that is bad; but ordinary streams of water and plumbing don't, and you really shouldn't sleep on top of it
Also, just about the most dangerous thing you can do is supposed to be sitting in a draft (as in wind) indoors
Actual wind outside, nah, fine; stuffy air, CO and CO2 poisoning inside, also fine but god forbid there's air moving inside, you can get all kinds of ailments from it
Whistling indoors is bad luck
Always make the sign of the cross when you pass a church (mostly only old ladies believe this one)
If you go to sleep before dawn on the summer solstice you’ll have a year of bad luck
If you are unmarried and sit on the corner of the table you are not going to get married for the next 7 years
We have the first two as well
> Looking at your cards before your entire hand has been dealt when playing 25
That sounds more like a game rule than a superstition
We have this thing (but I think many do) that you don't gift knives or other sharp things, period
If you want to give a knife to someone, they pay you, even if it's just a single cent
wow you guys have draft, too
I always thought it was our own special brand of stupid
I didn't use any folders and nothing was colour-coded
This thread has been very confusing and/or enlightening
I graduated in 2001, and I just used regular notebooks of varying thickness, one for each subject
We also had these very thin notebooks for homework
Granted, that was some 20 years ago, so some things might have changed (probably less notebooks and homework being done via internet and all that), but I still haven't heard anything about things being colour-coded
We'll talk again in June
I don't see how it's an issue with capitalism
When there's a shortage of housing, capitalists solve the problem by building more and selling it for profit
If they can't build more, it means there's someone preventing them from doing it
I think you need to float your island farther south then
Otherwise, you're missing out on the joy of having only 3 hours of daylight/darkness
Rent seeking happens under every economic system
The government's job is to minimize it
If it allows it to happen or is complicit in it, that's a failure of a specific government, not the economic system
I personally think that zoning laws are fundamentally a bad idea and have caused way more problems than they prevented
>Any economic system that eschews private property makes rent-seeking impossible by definition
You can have an economic system that eschews private property and still have a government awarding unearned resources to some people
>This power distribution, and the way it is supported, is what defines capitalism
When you define things like this, you can say that starvation defines socialism

Software developer communities are generally not localized
We all learn in english, share code and knowledge with documentation, tutorials, books
Why would anyone ever limit the future of a software project to only an arbitrary subset of the global talent pool
There is no good reason
Even for a small personal project, you never know when it could grow into something more that you share on GitHub
Maybe it's different in some countries (Germany comes to mind)
I've been working in international companies all my life, and my friend groups have also been international
No idea because there STILL isnt one here
At least they are working on it
Yeah, of course
Bit it depends on age, I guess

founded on the 18th of November, 1918 :)
101 years old
Or 819 years old if you count the creations of the Livonian order (an order of crusaders) who were the first form of government in the territory
happy independence day
I wouldn’t say so, they were a government composed of the German aristocratic ruling class, ruling over the Latvian and Estonian peasantry
The Livonian order was however, the earliest known organized government in Latvia, especially after it collapsed and gave way to the Duchy of Kurland, which was still unfortunately dominated by a German ruling class
Exact same situation here, too
Similar idea here
To me Sydney “felt” a lot like California (so did Vladivostok in Russia for that matter, another big Pacific city)
New Zealand, on the other hand, felt very British
The rural countryside had a lot of similarities, and the cities felt a lot like large English towns or small cities
It surprised me how much central Wellington resembled Birmingham or Manchester
There was absolutely nothing of the sort
Only for girls through 5th to 7th grade
Boys kad to learn woodcutting and carpentry instead
Yes, it was a minor feature in housekeeping class, a subject I really hated
It was only well after finishing school that I learned that at least now you apparently can learn more fun stuff with boys instead, if you push for it, apparently it now vounts as single subject with 'textile' or 'woodworking' group choice, instead of being stright up sexist
Nah man, cooking is so rare that it inly happens 1/2 a year

I think it's already a requirement for citizenship by naturalization
I didn't study art, however, studies  involved other kinds of projects that could be copyrighted and we were asked to sign copyrights over for work done during the studies
They did provide the equipment and software needed, plus for most part we had group works anyway

Russian is a Slavic language, is it not
Well I suppose if you meant as in the name isnt common in all Slavic languages, then I misunderstood you, I apologize
Brooklyn Nine-Nine has an episode named "Captain Latvia" where one of the characters and Boyle speak Latvian for a bit, though I cannot understand most of what they are saying
Potatoes and Russians aren't everywhere you see here
Before WW2, our army’s main insignia was the swastika (represented thunder or power in Latvian mythology) so when the Soviets occupied Latvia, they mistook our planes for German planes, and so there was a lot of friendly fire at the beginning, until the swastikas were painted over
After that, during operation Barbarossa
No, before WW2, the latvian army was very barebones, purely defensive, and what i meant was, when latvia was invaded, and later attacked by the germans, the small amount of planes we had, were called into battle, but some of them experienced friendly fire, due to their insignia being similar to german insignia
It's not my recent discovery but from times I was a teenager
Turned out Novuss, very popular game in Latvia is in fact Latvian-Estonian invention (similar games known in some other Nothern European countries though) and hardly ever heard anywhere else
It's not crazy popular (I blame the bland kindergarten/school lunches) but it's quite common here
Well in Latvia we do eat buckwheat, so atleast one third of Balts is covered
Really
Novuss is Latvian-Estonian invention
No wonder it is so popular here
We even have a table in our university
A sandwich
Only the Dutch have sandwiches
It's invention / interpretation, lots of games have square table and pockets on the corners
But this exact variant was shaped in Estonia and Latvia
In Latvia it became huge
In the 80's, you could see a novuss table in every yard during summer
Boys from the same neighborhood usually was saving many together to buy one table for themselves
Those who had personal - were everybody's friend
Boric acid easily available and cheap in any pharmacy in that time was used to polish the table
But in mid-end of 90's it was banned or something and seems like it affected the popularity of the game
It's really sucks to play unpolished table, but substitutes for the acid were kinda lame and really hard to find at least for a few years
Oh, certainly, no arguing that
It's just that a fair bit of people I know hate it because of past experience
When you cook it properly at home, it's actually quite good
But, to be honest, not something I would want to eat *every* day
From some googling it doesn't seem so but even then, open face sandwiches are not that unique
It's the default mode of sandwich where I live, for example
Seeing some of my coworkers' lunches and the state of the prepackaged sandwich shelves in shops, I beg to disagree
I mean, sure, it's not the only or even the absolute majority of lunches but still

We have mulled wine (Gluhwein) though
Some conquerors are better than others, though
We still remember the Swedes fondly, compared to the Germans, Poles, and Russians
Players of Sid Meiers's Civilization series - rise to the occasion
I would argue that it is Tatjana Ždanoka, co-chairwoman of the Latvian Russian Union party
This woman does whatever she can to promote a "let's fight for the good old days" rhetoric among the Russian-speaking populace in Latvia
She does not encourage the integration of minorities within Latvian society, but rather a conquest for "Russian rights" - Russian language as a state language, state funding for education entirely in Russian, and whatever else can be thought of
Every time there is some sort of agitation or claim about "discrimination against Russians in Latvia", this demon of a woman is at the forefront of it all
She has compared Latvia to Nazi Germany in international press in an attempt to gain support
All the while, she is known to make regular trips to Moscow, which often includes meeting Mr
Putin himself
Worst of all, she represents Latvia in the European Parliament
She is essentially a Russian agent making decisions for the European Union, and we're just letting that happen to us
TLDR: Pro-Russian woman that denounces Latvia as a fascist state
Represents Latvia in the European Parliament
It's either Artuss Kaimiņš or Aldis Gobzems
Artuss Kaimiņš - he's hipocritical and has a very high ego
When corona just started in Latvia, he got sick but continued going to work, although he had symptoms and lied to doctors about meeting someone infected and being abroad
He has also gotten in bar fights and is very disrespectful
Aldis Gobzems - terrorises other politicians during work and posts everything on his tik tok
He also tells young people to fuck off and read a book for once
Also was once caught eating his boogers
Both are dicks and think that they can get their message through by terrorising others and posting it on social media
Yes I love them

It's funny how the more conservative a region is, the more they tout their women's virtues as a point of pride for the whole country
Almost as if women were property, like a prize pig

I don't like potatoes
Like I love potato pancakes and mashed potatoes but I just can't stand boiled potatoes, fried potatoes (expect deep fried) and I especially hate potato salad and potato soup
From what I’ve gleaned so far, I strongly suspect no one really likes ouzo very much, they’ve just been keeping up appearances as a point of national pride, and hoping for someone to finally come out and say it

Albert Heijn in the Netherlands used to sell/give away a special key chain with an AH coin that fits in their carts
The key chain had a carabiner (or what's it called) to unclip the coin from the rest of the key chain
That was pretty cool since I random carried actual euro coins around
They're heavy and puff-up your wallet so much

Oh god, I remember now
When I was in school around 02-03, cockroaches were a regular occurrence, but I've not encountered one in the last 10 years
Oh, I remember how much of them we had
My family had big cd/casette music player and there was a place for big 6 x 9V batteries (we used wire to play music) and once I opened the cover
And about 10 of big red/orange cockroaches came out of there
Brr
Anyway, I say one at my new place 2 years ago
So they still exist somewhere
i legit don't think i've ever seen a cockroach
EDIT: I live in Latvia, not UK, now
In Latvia, the public transport system relies on these people that I call the "Ticket gestapo".
Rather than paying the bus driver, you can just hop on the bus here with no walking past the driver, or anything
You're meant to buy a card somewhere in the city, top it up, and scan it when you enter the bus
But most pedestrians just hop on for a stop or two and jump off
The weird way that Riga city has handled this, is to employ officers with scanner guns to come onto the bus randomly and check if you've scanned your pass, which is impossible to buy on the bus itself
If you haven't scanned, you get 30eur fine on the spot
I think to actually to that job you have to be a sociopath
It's such a backwards way of charging for public transport

What legal that should be illegal
I heard that advertising towards kids was illegal in Sweden and Finland
You're right, we should just ban all vices that I don't like, that worked out so well every time it's happened before
Better yet, we should just tax the fuck out of them so that all vices are just for the rich and powerful
After all, the rest of us are just here to work for them and make them money
Yes, that's indeed, normal
The European ones have normal sugar, not HFCS
Other things could also impact perception of sweetness like lower acid level or whatever
TIL we don’t have a binge drinking culture
We have them here as well, though it's hard to be "in the middle of nowhere" in Latvia, so they're mostly near some nature trail or nature park
ngl the potato jokes are getting a "bit" old at this point
We have 6 toes
Potatoes
The stereotype where we get compared to Slavic drunks
Our Baltic neighbours call us ice-cream bc we love it so much and Lithuanians believe that we have 6 toes

I thought you all just sat silently brooding in the sauna, listening to heavy metal and chainsmoking
Mostly just the introduction of the Euro
Difficult to go pro-East when the East is waging a war
Not OP but we also joined the Eurozone ~~at the same time~~ a year earlier
The Latvian lat was more expensive than the Euro, so everything seemed more expensive at the start, and people, including myself, were confused about the costs of a few things
Helped that at the start, for like a year, the prices of everything were written in both the Euro and the Lat
Eventually, you just get used to it, and when you go to other countries, you realise how nice it is to not have to bother with exchanging currency
We introduced the euro a year earlier
I remember driving through Lithuania in 2014 and they still had Litas
My bad, I assumed they were also 2014
Duh
Everyone knows that Latvia is the only legitimate successor of Roman Empire
Technically, we also didn't become communist
The interwar Republic of Latvia had a government in exile and the current republic is considered a direct continuation of the prewar state
The Latvian SSR was a different country established in 1945 and ended in 1991

What stupid games did you play when you were kids
Some examples from my childhood:
knuckles - one kid would put his fist on a table and another would flick a coin along the table at their knuckles
They would take turns flicking the coin until one gave up
We did this in 3rd and 4th grade until a rumor that someone got AIDS this way scared us off
palm slap - two kids would hold out their hands palm down
One kids hands would be over the others
Then the one whose hands are on the bottom would try to slap the top of the other kids hands before they can react
Again taking turns until one gives up
A more hardcore version was holding your hands in fists and rapping the knuckles
break the line - we'd split up in two groups, line up against each other holding hands, and then one kid from each team would run at the other line and try to break through the held hands
Often resulted in clotheslining, especially for shorter kids
shoulders - take turns punching each other in the shoulder until one gives up
What about “blackout”? Someone does couple of squats and then someone else takes a scarf or a jacket sleeve and applies moderate pressure to their neck area untill they pass out
We played this under the names kazaki-razboiņiki (cossaks and criminals) or indians and cowboys
>not really games but we sniffed bolero (soda powder) and huffed technocol rapid (instant glue) in school
Is that the origin of your username
We'd put a kid between two matresses and walk over him, called it the massage
We started off with this one, but it quickly devolved in to a pain tolerance contest
We played this too, when it was only boys the penalty for missing a catch was a kick in the ass
You mean put salt on your skin and rub it with an ice cube
Sounds like a good way to get cold burns
>Nobody ever won, we got bored and stopped after a few weeks when we realised hurting each other is dumb
Did you go to a school for gifted children
That reminded me - we played "the corpse", where you float face down for as long as possible, "the axe", where you try to sink to the bottom of the sea and stay as long as possible (we'd do this in shallow water), and "the moonrise", where you dive, do a somersault underwater while pulling down your pants, and then surface naked ass-first
We also did the sticker slapping game, but mostly used the wrappers from the ["Love is" chewing gum]
Austrija- Ungārija or Austrijas-Ungārijas impērija or Austroungāru impērija
So basically same just with little changes that comes with the language
Austroungārijas impērija
Can you explain why it is like that
I mean you have a healthy country with good income and everything seems to be fine
Vāvere
Pronounced the way it's written, the "ā" is like "a" in "water" but longer
Vāvere
I don't think it would be that hard for non-native speakers
Vāvere
Vaaverae
The language is Latvian
As for the origin, not sure - perhaps it has something to do with the latin word "viverra", meaning "ferret".
Fridge
I don't think I've ever seen anyone I know not keeping them in the fridge
Maybe unless the person has no fridge and eats the eggs straight away

Brits are officially metric, have been for quite a while now
I had a tricycle and later a bicycle with a helper wheels as a kid, but I never learned how to ride it without the helper wheels
Eventually I outgrew that bike and for obvious reasons didn't get a new one (there wasn't really any need for me to have a bicycle anyway), so at least as a kid and teen I never learned
I finally did learn in my early thirties, but I pretty much never use it anyway
No real need for it, I prefer to go for a walk
Learnt to ride at the of 5ish on a Soviet bike that had the frontal brakes on the right side of the handlebar
Did a couple of carthwheels while braking before my father loosened the tension wires
Did a couple of carthwheels when I got my first MTB, due to that one having the frontal brakes on the left side and the rear brakes on the right side
Got myself deep into mountain biking at around 15 and almost broke a couple of bones before getting older/smarter and moving on to other, safer activities, like drinking and going clubbing
Started biking again seriously after I moved to the Netherlands, nearly 10 years later
I don't really know anyone that can't at least keep their balance on a bike while on a straight road, though some of my (foreign) study mates came close
I learnt it only at 20 y. o. and I'm very proud of it
Next thing to learn — now to swim
I kinda can do it, but for the little distance/time, because I have a fear of a depth
No, I really wanted a bicycle as a kid, because my cousin had one (but wouldn't let me ride)
When I was in teens and had allready lost interest I won a bicycle in lottery, learned to ride somewhat, but didn't keep doing it since I thought it was illegal to ride it without licence after 12 and I didn't feel I was good enough to pass any test
I decided to try again last year and I can't

In movie form, that was what the crazy never made sequel to Gladiator was intended to be
We have brāļukas for lithuanians, and lithuanians have braliukai for us
Both are diminutive for brothers
Lithuanians as brāļi, literally brothers, because of the shared history, similar cultures and languages, etc
I guess Estonians would be the weird brothers too haha
Not the Welsh though
Leek-eating sheep shaggers
That's interesting, didn't know it, thanks
Jums arī!
I was studying during USSR falling apart, so it was very interesting mix of views :) But mainly we studied prerequisites, invasion to Poland and whole Eastern front in details
Allies and their actions were only high-level touched in school programs, most of attention out of Eastern front was given to partisan wars on occupied territories and concentration camps
Japan actions also were usually mentioned just briefly
Yours, actually
Period under Swedish Empire were concidered better than most foreign empires that ruled here, but serfdom was never abolished in territories of Latvia
They're everywhere here
Latgaliešu (Latgalian)
I don't know the language as it's not an official one, but I live in Latgale
It's sounds like a mix between old Latvian and Russian
Some people in my family, as well as some of my classmates speak it very well
Kurzeme (Kurland) also has their own dialect, which is pretty cool
Latgalian
Some people call it a dialect but it's a lot too different for that
Regular Latvians from outside of Latgale region understand it only a little better than Lithuanian
Also Livonian, which is related to Estonian and Finnish
The last native speaker died a while back but there have been efforts to revive it recently
I think around 100 people maybe speak it to a reasonable degree
I think the concensus about Letigallian is that it's also just a dialect of Latvian, rather than it's own language
In Courland, we do also have our own dialect, but again, still Latvian
The only thing from the dialect of Letigallia that I've heard is a song, "Vysskaistuokajai meitiņai". Spelling might not be right
Also Scots
A language that split off from Middle English and is pretty similar to English, but still distinct
Yeah, I know, it's sad
Must've been a pretty cool language tho
Well, my dad spoke to a few linguists, and they've said that Latgalian is a language, where as Kurdish (Kurzeme) is still a dialect
I'm not really passionate about either region, I'm just repeating what linguists have told me
Well there's also [this song] it's become a bit of a meme
I also don't know the spelling, but the meaning of the title is sweet
You're probably right then, I vaguely remember it from, I think, my Latvian teacher who's a linguist and from that neck of the woods
Kurdish is not something used for Kur/Courland, Kurdish is an Iranic language spoken by the Kurds in Turkey/Syria/Iran
Courland/Couronian is what I use that causes no confusion
Yeah, linguists probably know what constitutes as a language better than use haha
I've just remembered that Kurdish really is a middle east language, not one spoken in Kurzeme
I had forgotten that, thanks for reminding me, seriously
I'll now remember to call Kurzeme's dialect Couronian
Yeah, also the song's pretty sweet
I don't have a license and walk to work
Public transport gets me to any part of the city in less than an hour, but I rarely need it
The Balkans are first of all a peninsula, so the border ought to be between the extreme northern points of the Adriatic Sea and the Black Sea forming a line roughly between Odesa in Ukraine and Trieste in Italy
In Latvia, there is still a good chance to stumble to something
From as recent period of WW2 to pre crusades
It is still possible to stumble in forests to remains of wartime equipment and in same forest to stumble on rock formation predating crusades (my ex-wife found some German and soviet helmets half buried right next to rock pile from much older times), rarer is to find money deposits
I grew up in country side which used to belong to some German baron, but later land was split between Latvian freedom fighters
As a kid I found deposit of Latvian interwar coins buried near the tree and polish-lithaunian coin from 1666 while digging in vegetable harden
In my city there is free public transport for those who live here
It started as free transport for schoolchildren and seniors, and now it is free for everyone
We have those contactless "Jurmala resident card" which you need to swipe on terminal in the bus
When I need to go to another city you can use train or intercity bus
For both of them you can buy tickets in mobile apps and then show them from phone screen
Of course you can buy it in old-fashioned way too
Intercity buses generally have contactless payment terminals, so you can just pay with your card or phone with NFC when you are getting in the bus
In Riga (capital city) we have contacless RFID tickets called e-talons
Even for 1 ride you need to buy e-talons
You can buy paper ticket from driver, I believe, but I've never seen someone doing it
You can buy them in in small shops (kiosks) called Narvesen or in some big shops info centres
You buy them, get on the bus (or something else), touch terminal with it and voila -  your ride is registered
Terminal will show how many rides are left on your e-talons
If you need to use Riga public transport more often, then you can get personalised e-talons
This thing can be refilled, and you can load more advanced tickets to it, for example, month ticket
There are terminals where you can refill them (but I'm not sure if you can buy one-time tickets in them)
One ride cost is 1
15 euro, but I'm a student, and my personalised e-talons have student discount so I can buy rides for 0
27 euro
In Riga we have RFID chip card of three kinds - single use yellow that is preloaded with a number of tickets and blue with or without id that you can load tickets on
Besides one-ride tickets, you can also buy tickets for a period of time for different types of transportation
You can also purchase paper ticket for one ride from the driver (and IIRC at places where you'd normally buy or load cards as well)
Other cities have different public transportation systems, for example, I recsntly heard Ventspils relies on minibuses that have different price on each route
Some smaller towns likely don't have their own systems and people use intercity transport, which probably still has paper tickets that you buy beforehand or from the driver
In Rīga there’s an electronic card for all public transports-‘E-Talons’.In my city Rēzekne there’s so called ‘Rēzeknieša karte’which is basically the same thing
Both cards are given only to registered residents of the city,thou in Riga you can buy a small amount of these cards,even if you are not a resident of the city
You can also pay in cash,if you want
We are building a new solar collector array to provide hot water (and/ or central heating) for at least part of our town Salaspils

For Latvia, it would be Ice Hockey, and actually, Latvia and Finland are the only countries in Europe where Hockey is more popular than football
Every May annually Latvia goes crazy about our hockey team and the IIHF world championship
Probably get our food and go the living room to play video games with Lithuania, Estonia and anyone else who'd join us
Meanwhile Estonia is trying to crash your party and we're constantly dragging him away so he don't embarrass himself even more
Not unless Gordon Ramsey is cooking and is the head chef
Until the Nordics bartender cuts them off and suddenly they're the ones crashing our table where the booze flows freely

Yes, for government employees it's a day off
To lessen government spending and not loose efficiency of this day
They will have to work on 2021-05-08 (Saturday)
For private companies it's a company's free choise
Depends on business model and who your major clients are generally
Also a recommendation is that this day should be a holiday and work should be done on 2021-05-08 (Saturday)
Yes, but only because tomorrow is our 2nd independance day and they just moved today to a saturday
It is a day off, since 4th of May (independence restoration day) is free and so there would not be a weird gap we have 4 days free (1st to 4th)
Because of it we will have to work the following Saturday
> Do clean the scissors thoroughly before and after use
You don't want to contaminate food with dirty leftovers from in between the mechanism
There are kitchen scissors that can be taken apart easily, just open them far enough and the joint can be separated, then you can wash each side just like a knife

Every album from [Skyforger] is more or less really high quality
This particular song because you asked of a national instrument - the strings you hear at the beginning is one of our traditional instruments [kokle] (pronounced kuokle)
They sing mostly in Latvian but have songs in English and Lithuanian as well, would recommend to anyone interested in folk rock/metal
For Latvia it would be the

In Latvian it's just "paldies". After it, you can add pronouns for whom the thank you is intended, but the word itself doesn't change
Uhh, I have no idea how to explain it
Dreary national literature from the 19th century national awakening and the interwar period that, without exception, is chosen to inflict on the children that a Latvian's life is one of suffering and pain, and if anything good happens to one, they'll pay for it later, with interest
For example, one of the mainstays of the curriculum, if I recall correctly, read in about 6th or 7th grade, is called "In the shadow of death" and it is basically a story about fishermen on an ice floe slowly succumbing to death
I mean it probably works if one's ultimate goal is to prepare the kids to be resilient when their land is ravaged by one side or another every generation or so; it's mightily depressing if you want to have well-adjusted people in the peacetime
Any foreign books, like Hamlet, Macbeth, Dante, Kafka, Erich Maria Remarque, and J. D. Salinger, regardless of the subject, were the *fun* parts in literature classes
Latvian language is full of Germanisms
7 centuries under german rule have not gone unnoticed
Our language is basically what you get if you take the ancient proto-indo-european and replace roughly two thirds of the vocabulary with German
Dievlūdzējs - "diev(s)" meaning "God" and "lūdzējs" meaning "(someone who) prays".
[Saule, Pekons, Daugava - Sun, Thunder, Daugava]
Funny how people use to consider Germany discount Austria
- So where are you from
- Latvia
- Do you mean Lithuania
Stranger : where are you from
Me : Latvia
Stranger : Oh so you’re like Russian right
It’s probably around seven
thousand
At least a solid 2
* Private health insurance
* Free internet (I work for an ISP)
* Discounted phone plan (~80% off compared to regular price for that carrier)
The word "ieairē" which would translate as "[you] row it in" was the first that came to mind
Although I guess I'm cheating by using a prefix "ie"
We don't really have a _colonized_ version of latvian but we do have latgalian which is a dialect
For me I'd say that written latgalian is mostly understandable but spoken is like 90% complete gibberish
I guess it be the [first awakening] considering it basically created the idea of a Latvian state
And the war of independence and ww1 as well
Most of our food comes from Russia (dishes that are popular, at least) and honestly
sorry to any Russians here but I find most of them absolutely vile, so any family gatherings/weddings/events usually leave me hungry
Though the first thing that comes to mind is that thing where it's meat inside a jelly that's made from beef stock, and people like to dip it in vinegar
It's so disgusting my brain can't even register it as food
Spekmaizes
It’s literally pig fat - not the good bits, just the fat which is supposed to be slow cooked away - served cold on rye bread
Usually served with vodka diluted with the briny pickle juice straight from the can
Which part of that is supposed to sound appealing
Stop ruining my vodka you psychopath fucks
Cold beet root soup
It's basically beets, potato, sausage, eggs and spices with this thing called kefir
Thankfully both me and my husband hate it
The whole country loves it during the summer
2 or 3, all in Rīga (capital)
Opened recently (first one was in like 2016)
And since I love eating chicken, it quickly became my favorite fast food restaurant
Hope they make more and closer to me
Edit: since everyone was comparing  the count with Burger King's and McDonald's we have like 12 McDonalds and none of Burger Kings, although at least 2 are opening very soon this year
We have literally just one KFC in Latvia
I've been there once maybe
Didn't think much of it
KFC is the last fast food joint I'll go
Fake chicken
Burgers suck
I say the same about McDonalds
Can't eat there anymore
Hesburger's the only place we frequent
However I'm not found of new products, it feels they tryin to give less for more by masking it with NEW
I'd say not that much
My wife didn't know how to cook when I met her
After years and years of me cooking in front of her eyes, she knows a lot now
But we could literally go out now and buy a relatively good takeaway food for competitive price in 7 to 10 minutes
Cooking's more like a family day together doing stuff etc
Pretty much everywhere in EU, but probably Finland and Sweden most of all
Maybe also Ukraine
First two because we get a lot of visitors from Finland, especially for hockey games because the tickets and beer are a lot cheaper in Latvia
Sweden because it's just across the Baltic Sea and there's 2 boats per day; most Latvians have done it a few times and it's like a rite of passage as a teenager to take the party boat to Stockholm
Also because of Vikings and more recently Swedish Empire there's a lot of words in modern Latvian that are borrowed from Swedish
Ukraine because there's a lot of Russians in Latvia with Ukrainian heritage, and a lot of Latvians with Ukrainian heritage for that matter
A lot of Ukrainians moved to Latvia after Chernobyl and whatnot
I mean, it's only got Belarus being a visa-requiring douche country in the way otherwise it'd be only a little bit longer a drive than Poland
Sweden
I live closer to Gotland than I do to Riga, I use a Swedish bank, half of our media are owned by Swedish companies, and I think our internet comes from across the Baltic in Sweden
I’d say that it would be Sweden
I’d have put Sweden (and Germany) down for this question
But we kinda share a sea border if exclusive economic sea zones count
Anyway, a fair bit of shared history, assistance during the restoration of independence, even though these days our most notable link with Sweden is enriching your bank shareholders
Italians and French are natural enemies
Just like Spanish and French, English and French, Germans and French, French and other French
**Estonia:**
Had a great weekend in Weeknd Baltic, paid some bus driver to stop for alcohol, lmao
**Lithuania:**
2 cities had the same address, so I was about 150km off my original address
**Denmark:**
Was sleeping on the streets, almost froze to death
**Belgium:**
Tasted many many beers, they are so good
**Germany:**
Saw some street artists playing drums, but drums are plastic barrels
Realistically none
But if Putin's looking for recommendations it would probably be the Latgale region it has its own language and culture plus it houses the largest Russian minority outside of Riga I believe
I love rye bread sandwiches with meat, cucumber, cheese, ketchup and mayonnaise
I have one sandwich i feel guilty for liking because it's really unhealthy
It's white bread, with butter and lots of sugar sprinkled on top
To add to this, the relatively recently appointed Latvian PM (Krišjānis Kariņš) and the very recently elected President (Egils Levits) both seem to be honorable and reasonable persons so that gives me hope that the direction of our country is a good one
Similar developments are taking place in the very powerful Riga municipality, where the rather corrupt mayor has been ousted (funnily enough, the former mayor has now lost a court case against an oposition politician who had called him the face of corruption)
This circus is still in progress though, many people are waiting for the current interim situation to expire so that new election could be held in Riga municipality
The Latvian Naval forces are headquartered in Liepāja, I think everything else is in Riga
Ei vittu saatanaa
If anything, that’s a Swedish thing
1 channel lost its position a decade ago
Nowadays it's TV 3 but it account only for like 9% of all viewers, and it's news, a couple of shows and stuff for kids mainly
We have developed internet platforms
TV boxes and alternative platforms are really popular
I'd say among my generation there's probably no one watching TV channels except occasional news
Commas
The language has a bunch of rules and is extremely complex, but most people trip on incorrect commas
Prescriptivism, people shouldn't really be questioning what the rules for using words in their native language is (oviously doesn't apply to using too many loans and/or words in a way that deviates entirely from socially agreed meaning snd such, but for example, insisting that sensitive can be used only for enotions and you should say s**a**nsitive for phisical sensations, when nobody does that IRL)
I don't think so

Only one that comes to my mind is Brainstorm

We have many more great artists, most simply stay local :)
Oggy and the cockroaches is also french
man what a language trip that is
Or Iceland
I guess German
Not sure why, I just like it
Russian is cool too, it has a gigantic vocabulary
Gorbachev in his time it seems
The Pope's Swiss guards are pretty well known in general
the current one, almost everything before that fucking sucked lol
Could you please clarify the difference in meaning of those two Czech words
Thanks
Only one that was opened only 2 years ago
Everyone agrees we are Baltics
Everyone disagrees if Baltics are Eastern or Northern Europe
I’m fine with the label of all three
People call Finland Nordic or Scandinavian when the language and history is completely different from vikings
We’re Northern compared to a lot of Europe, but we did used to be in the Eastern Bloc
Northern, Eastern, who gives a shit what label anyone wants to put on it, we’re here on the map, done
And if I’m in a place where no one knows where Latvia is, I’m still gonna say “next to Russia” anyway
That’s another one - I spent most of my childhood in UK and it seriously confused me the first time anyone called it Northern Europe
I’ve always considered it Western Europe
Er, well that part surely isn’t open to interpretation
UK and Ireland are part of the continent of Europe (but maybe not continental Europe, if you see what I mean)
Scandi + Nordic
Not at all
The languages are closely related but not mutually intelligible
Isn’t there a difference between Nordic and Northern
I thought Nordic was for viking countries ie Scandinavia plus Iceland
Classifications that put the Baltics in Northern Europe:
- UNESCO
- EuroVoc
- National Geographic Society
- Committee for International Cooperation in National Research in Demography
- STW Thesaurus for Economics
Classifications that put the Baltics in Eastern Europe:
- CIA World Factbook
Yes that’s true, but for me Brexit is “only” about membership of the EU
They can’t change geography with a referendum, UK will always be part of Europe, no one can take that away
There is no reasonable way to split all European countries into simple North South East West groups
In your model, Denmark is in North, but Latvia which is almost entirely north of Denmark is in East
And you’ve split the Baltic States between North and East, when they are lined up directly North South of each other
Whichever way you do it, someone will disagree
Best to stick with known clusters eg Baltics, Nordics, Scandi, British Isles, Gallia, Benelux, etc
I guess a little bit in a joking way
More so that Latvians and Lithuanians are brāļi (brothers) together with our weird northern cousin (Estonia)
Latvia is better at hockey and when Latvians and Lithuanians start to have a drinking contest, that shit can end dangerously :D
We have pine forests and kippers in Surrey !
Exactly that kind of thing - all the Baltic peoples have eachother’s backs and we recognise that we’re all in pretty similar positions after the history of the last 100 years or so
So, we all get on and stick together and have fun with it I suppose
Yes, of course
Guests do the same
Why would I want to track dirt all over my apartment
And if not that, it's just more comfortable without shoes
(It's pretty common to wear slippers indoors, though, but well, those are strictly indoor footwear and are usually very comfy)

It’s kinda very patriotic and symbolises independence from Soviet Union
There’s a video from Latvian song and dance festival
You can buy rabbit meat in supermarkets here
We have special shops for will boar, deer, etc
And those are expensive
But yeah, we eat that sometimes
When Prisma still was open here, they had packaged farmed deer and moose meat
It was pretty similar in price to beef, if I recall correctly
I'm guessing those specialty shops have hunted wild meat, that's why it's more expensive (well, that, and the obligatory Latvian small business practice of *varka*.)
Varka
Couldn't tell you
Never been to one of those shops
But it you look at canned meats, canned deer is twice as expensive, as good quality canned beef
Rabbit, however, is about the same as beef
There are some expensive cuts of steak that are more expensive, and there are cheap cuts of beef that are less expensive than rabbit, so I'm roughly averaging here
The practice that, when establishing a small to medium business you must first get yourself a BMW X5, Audi Q7 or a Porsche Cayenne; get a mortgage for a decent house somewhere on the better outskirts of Riga; and set aside a tidy sum for yourself for future travels and other personal expenses - only then you can afford to think of such measly things as employee salaries, taxes and settling invoices with subcontractors
Estonia and Latvia
If it's dark as the original tale then yes
kebab and burgers

You've missed a couple of steps there, pal

I swear in the future there will be a comedy series about Brexit and it's aftermath
Good question
I think Theresa May can be played by that women from Devil wear's Prada I forgot her name
"Man pie dirsas" - By my ass
"Tas mani nerausta" - It's not tuggin / pulling me
I guess “man pohuj” is used a lot
Man = me
Pohuj = coming from Russian but the literal translation would be something like “by a dick”
During the economic crisis of 2008 there was firm in Latvia that would give 1000 USD in exchange for customers souls
yep
Same here in Latvia

When I was a teenager I dreamed of becomming a president
These days I need to read comments of some news article to realize that I don't want to represent everyone
This man gets it, he is reasonable
I express my sympathy in him having to deal with idiots
I use Apple products everyday, but It will be funny if they don’t include european charger and you need to buy it for 39

Does this include laptops
I wish i could have my car back
11 minutes of comfy driving is hell of a lot better than freezing my nuts off waiting 30 minutes for a bus thats packed and smells like old people
Could use a bike but i'd get run over, and if i didnt someone would steal it
Great job
When I went to Poland I was really surprised of why there were billboarda everywhere
Beautiful countryside with mountains, forests and rivers and 15 advertisement signs in front of it all
The government decides how much to pay teachers, they don't decide on footballers
There is a key difference between the two: there are very few athletes who earn lots of money while there are significantly more scientists
If the sport stars' money was taxed and split amongs scientists they probably wouldn't see the difference
Also you can't blame the fans for supporting their team, buying merchandise and tickets for games
Its just what they do
whats with all the dickheads in the comments
I mean, both are in Europe so that is enough for me
Abortation shouldnt even exist, they must think of that before sex
( go ahead, downvote liberals)
if you wanna get rid of Catholics, first start with those pesky Muslims
Yes and
You are probably pro-choice femi-commie
Most of abortations is done due not wanting to keep you legs shut
Abortation is something to thing about in country level, not individual thing
God save Poland
Its countrys business

I remember reading a story that they packed shotguns in case of meeting bears after landing
*Napalm has left the chat*
Seriously though, I was horrified thinking about those windows last night
Well there were at least two sources for the news to go by: the firemen stated that they didn't know how much if anything they could save, and I seem to recall that the curch representatives came out with some pretty grim predictions
The latter could be seen as going into panic mode (but still understandable, seeing how it was obviously an emotional moment), but the former was just an honest reply at the time when the fire was the biggest and they didn't know if they could even contaminate it
Mind you that the North tower actually did catch fire for a time
Doesn't UK have any procedure for citizens to call a referendum
Arcanum anyone
I was surprised Latvia isn't in the average category, and same for Romania and Hungary, At least when looking at what countries are in the average category
I wouldn't say worrying for any of us though, Hungary or any of the countries I mentioned aren't in the same category as Russia for sure
But is that comparable to Russia still
Not really, no
And this says most data maps results, not a measure of democracy
Being that bad in 1 category and meh in most others doesn't put Hungary on par with Russia if Russia scores that bad in a multitude of categories and not really above meh in any category for the most part, with a lot of just bad scores
And I mean I bet you Hungary has some of the most trans accepting people in Eastern/Central Europe, this is more important than not being able to legally change your gender for trans peoples wellbeing
Fuuck I just want normal snow again

Those are new cars, and electric cars last less and replacing the battery is quite expensive and in older ones even impossible
Idk how it is with modern cars but i had an older electric car with only about 100km battery range when i got it and half a year later it became only about 50 kilometres
The combined powers of aquaduct and viaduct

is latvian the most handsome or does it seem like that only because I am latvian myself
The title is wrong
USSR didn't have police, but militia
Also word "race" was not used by militia, but nationality (национальност)
Race term existed but was only used in scientific/biological sense
Here are more anthropological types of USSR population from Criminality research institute of Interior ministry of USSR

everyone recognized the joke, problem is, the joke is so played out that it is not funny in the slightest my guy
>Aren’t Latvians and Lithuanians closely related though
They look very different here
The ancestors of Latvians and Lithuanians were cut off during Northern Crusades, and generally for the next 600 years were part of different countries
As opposed to ancestors of Latvians and Estonians who for around 700 years partially or completely have lived in the same country
More than half a millennia is a lot of time for people to change
I have absolutely no objections to this
theres not actually a lot of blondes here
2020 definitely does not have an anticlimactic ending to be sure
In Latvia this winter we had no snow
Awesome, I hate cold :D
I love being able to bicycle everywhere in February
Climate change is totally a hoax

If He stayed abroad, they probably would have kept sending assassins after him, now that he’s in Russian custody though, if he dies, that’s like Putin admitting he murders opposition leaders
And even if they do, he will become hopefully something of a martyr

Navalny wants Western prosperity and Russian imperialism
He supports Putin's aggressive foreign policy and thinks that Crimea belongs to Russia
He still doesn't understand that the annexation of Crimea and his imprisonment have the same roots
Democracy and Krimnashism aren't compatible - pick one or the other
It's like 2 mobsters having a power struggle to become the next boss of their mafia family
Yup - and still thinks that Crimea belongs to Russia
It's obviously Cologne

The Polish Government is messed up
SARS immunity was at most 6 months after recovery
Even if that was the case, a considerable portion of recovered COVID patients have bad side effects like diminished lung capacity after recovery
Plus there's a possibility that the virus will mutate into something new by the next season - why do you think flu and the common cold keep coming back every year
Have you read his last tweets
All that "I am winning" whining is hilarious

Never, because this is a common design issued by all the eurozone for some EU anniversary and many people probably wouldn't like the childish aesthetic of it enogh to pay for looks

This is equivalent to cutting out people's tongues in the middle ages
It just shows that the state is afraid of what they have to say
This "protest" is just a reason for kids to skip school
The leader has no clue what she is talking about and has no real suggestions for the governing bodies rather than "reeeeee".
Spez-----
Have you people actually listened to the kid
She answered the question of "What is wrong with the climate" with "Everything". She literally has no fucking idea what she wants
Go maybe protest China and their lack of efforts for minimizing the climate change
Nope what
Maybe I have missed some memo where it's written up what her suggestions/demands are
How the hell is it acceptable for a leader of a movement to not have an answer or solution to a problem the movement is protesting
By saying that you are implying that it's not really her problem, but the problem of the state
She just "raises awareness"? I have enough of awareness raised, I don't need kids skipping school to make me understand that climate change exists
I, too, like to speak a million sentences without actually saying anything
You answered your question in the very same comment
They don't have any understanding of climate change, and very certainly a lot less than your average governing body
All I am saying is don't fucking protest for a cause of you don't have a solution for
You said that it's an intricate matter, and I won't deny it, it's not as easy as "lol wind power now".
Don't expect some suits to figure out a way to fix your life just because you bitched about it a bit on a Friday afternoon and held a sign with a funny punchline
Balkan nationalism is the most idiotic ever
Most of you speak the same language
So here's a village that's inhabited by people who look like us and speak the same language
So we should exterminate every single of them and put them in a mass grave

Balkan nationalist logic is incomprehensible to me
its times like these when I wonder
how stupid must you be to do such a thing
Steam and other services made stealing obsolete
It's actually ephebophilia
Yeah, I've heard this bullshit before
It's stealing and you know it
Everyone knows it
Stop pretending
People pirate, because they want to get shit without paying
I know - I did it as well when I was younger and stupider
No, they didn't. Pirates are pieces of shit
No it isn't easier
Stop lying
In the age of steam sales you can have 1000 games in your steam library that you don't even play
Thieves have no excuse these days
It's still taking shit without paying
I work in software development and want to get paid
If you still steal in the era of Steam sales, Spotify, Netflix and Youtube, then you're a horrible piece of shit
Get a job and get out of your parent's basement for once

Libertarianism is an idiotic ideology
We can already see how it (doesn't) work in darknet and crypto markets
Turns out that without government regulation scams and thievery run rampant
>With the exception of recently released blockbusters, **there is no evidence to support the idea that online copyright infringement displaces sales
So there's actual evidence that piracy negatively affects sales
This is why Denuvo and other DRM solutions are used
To prevent piracy in the first few months or weeks
It doesn't muddy anything
Piracy is using something without paying
Sure - it's more comparable to sneaking into cinema or concert hall without paying
But it's still just as wrong as stealing
Average day in Denmark
here is a good video about this subject
short story : Soviets treated their disabled people like total fucking garbage, even their WW2 veterans
So much for the ''glorious victor nation'' indeed
Nothing has changed since then
Russians chose Putin for the same reason
*In early September it came, a war unknown to the world
Lmao
On 9th of May Russia and several other post-soviet states celebrate Victory day, which was heavily popularized in USSR by Breznem (I think), thus the reason for sudden surge of Soviet military posts
Well maybe we delayed a climate change just a little bit
*Sorts by controversial*
This is where the fun begins
One aspect of that I've seen talked about is basically that, even if we talk about USSR, we're talking about seven decades, while the part where the Soviet Communist implementation of the ideology was compareable to Nazism was really under one leader
Not that the other times were good as such in the Soviet Union, but they were certainly not AS bad, or bad in a different sense (civil war, for example)
This is a problem because, for example, if you look at a decade like the 60s where USSR was doing nothing worse than sending people to work camps, torturing them in KGB basements and arresting people for listening to rock'n'roll, and claim that it was as bad Nazis - well, it just wasn't, the amount of people killed, tortured and put in camps was much lower
Which kinda discredits the idea of likening the two regimes

Please tell me what where the material benefits for UK and France from the Munich deal as opposed to what the Soviets gained from Molotov Ribentrop act
Might as well compare paying protection money with extorting protection money
Will you just randomly post more replies to my comment
Regarding the benefits Germany received
After the pact with Soviets Germany received more than half of Europe and strategic war resources from Soviets, which landed Germans at the actual height of their power
>Saving them from war
Soviets invaded Poland, so what you are saying is blatantly false

This is why countries exist, because we each have our own values and traditions
This is why I am against immigration from outside Europe because I don't trust government to properly assimilate these immigrants
You dont have to tell me that, we have like 40% russian population
Also i said outside europe, we in europe kinda get each other to some extent

I can't imagine what it takes for Russians to be out on the streets of Moscow protesting
They're fully aware of the brutality of the Kremlin and yet they proceed
Now that's courage
Why
No matter who rules over Russia - they all think that Latvia must be annexed to Russia
When Stalin died Khruschev didn't give us independence
Even if they overthrow Putin - whatever replaces him will still think that we are Nazis and Crimea will not be returned to Ukraine
And they might give that control to someone worse than Putin
So - no thanks
Why
Their so-called opposition still thinks that Crimea belongs to Russia and that Baltic states are a bunch of russophobic nazis who should also be reeducated and annexed to Russia
Nemtsov was different, but they killed him
Existing situation when Russia is ruled by FSB is one of the worst possible
There always is a hope that Russia will no go in circles in it's  politics in the future
People in Russia definitely aren't  bad only part of them is influenced by one sided propaganda
If they overthrow Putin - whatever replaces him will not be much better
Even "liberal" Navalny doesn't want to return Crimea
Russia always goes in circles
100 years ago they had a revolution where they overthrew their Tsar
Yeah, he was a tyrant and not a good guy
But what did come after
Liberal democracy
Equality and civil rights for all
No - a much worse regime that started the worst war in history and murdered millions
In the 90s that regime collapsed under its own weight
And what came after that
Liberal democracy
Nope - a bad joke of a president, oligarchs and mafia running the country and then the economy collapsed
And what did the Russians learn from all that
They put another dictator in power in 2000 and he's been running the country ever since
So what makes anyone think that after getting rid of this dictator there finally be liberal democracy in Russia and not something much worse than Putin
Even Navalny doesn't want to return Crimea
No one Russian politician would return Crimea to Ukraine soon
It would be political suicide
But there are many thing that could be done to improve the situation
Free movement of people and sea traffic to Azov sea , economic agreements etc
Any protester who just wants the government to steal a bit less and be a bit less corrupt, but otherwise agrees with its foreign policy - deserves his beating, because he still hasn't learned anything
And recognising Soviet occupation and giving back Abrene will also be political suicides
That's why I don't really give a shit who's in power in Russia - they're all bad
At least Putin is somewhat predictable and it's unlikely that he's going to attempt an invasion into a NATO country
WTF
Why did she moved to East
That's admirable and incredibly stupid at the same time
Not anymore
I got a speeding ticket in Estonia for going 56 in 50, I am still salty about it
You still should get supplements even if you get enough sun all year long
Love the little "oh" from Latvia and Lithuania after Estonia explains his black line
"Damn, Estonia just out-depressed us both with that one
Green for swampforest
Ornaments historical
Wrong shade of red tho
Maybe it represents the giant epic mining trucks they make there

Eh, it's meme even outside the Internet - the flag was modeled after a one-line description in a Medieval chronicle that doesn't explain the colors
The only explanation for our (Latvian) flag I ever heard was this legend about a tribe chief being laid on a white sheet and bleeding out - it was stained with blood on the sides and stayed white where the body was
The sheet was used as a flag in the next battle which they won
because Suomi > Finland
and Finland < Funland
I'm scrolling through reddit, wanting to find something about Latvia, my country
Found something
Not what I wanted/expected tho ;-;
I think this bodes well with general law of 'not being a dickhead'.
I don't know where that screenshot is from in your second link but even if (especially if) it's from some official source, it says that a sticker alone isn't enough to charge with petty hooliganism
> If such a word is placed on a car, and isn't otherwise promoted, for example, by shouting or otherwise expressing, such writing isn't suitable basis for sanctioning
It is much more likely that he got the hooliganism charge for something else
Also, the punishment for that is a monetary fine, instead of roadside alterations to one's vehicle
This looks rather like the officer's interpretation of letting him off easy
They charged him with hooliganism and not wearing a seat-belt
His GF got fine for leaving the car without permission
They cannot explicitly force you to do it, nor is it forbidden by law to have such a sticker
However, 1) the police officer might not be a law scholar and is overstepping his bounds or 2) is letting him off easy and not charging him for something else
None law
There doesn't exist such a thing in the law here
It is also a non-existent law
We got worse food y'know
Like the bread soup
Or the watermelon milk
Ew, don't get me started on the watermelon milk
It's terrible thoo ;-;
Haha, most of the people I meet online don't even know what Latvia is
It feels nice hearing all your stories from times you've been in Latvia or just these thoughts
Pretty cool that you even know what it is XD
Someone stole my bicycle and the police immediately sent 2 patrol cars to search for it in the direction where this moron drove
They found the guy like after 15 minutes
Honestly, love our police, can't say anything bad about them, so probably murican dream
He's just living the murican dream
Honestly, I once drive with my parents and the police stopped us
We were supposed to pay a fine of 50 euros, because we were driving 90 kph when we were supposed to drive 80
well since it was late and everyone was tired, that police guy actually let us go, and just said that he won't let us go next time
I love the cops here XD
You gonna diss our bean salad
Your country fucked us in two wars
I thought our national food was gray peas, but here we are, talking about bean salad ;-;
What
WHAT
Germany is always associated with Hitler anyways
What's that bad about A GODDAMN BEAN SALAD
Puts things into perspective
Well done
Of course the irony is that Turkey is not there, even though Turks have actually attacked and killed Russian soldiers and their allies in the last few years, and multiple times at that
But instead of Turks we have the real threat of Russia at full display here : the scary scary Latvia, with its 2 million population
It should be renamed ''list of countries that are convenient to hate for Putin at this moment, might change every 5 minutes depending on circumstances and corruption''
It feels good to be here
Right
Yaaawn
I guess the guys in front of the screen obscure a "Page 1 of 22" message
And the list definitely includes Russia
Damn Russians
They ruined Russia
*Sees latvia on the list*
*Chuckles* I'm in danger
lmao ofc most occupied countries made it
they even were so nice to include all the baltics
What did Georgia do to piss Russians off
UK flag says “Great Britain”, so Northern Ireland doged the bullet
Welcome to the club
Indeed
lol I live here in Latvia, and I have been to Turkey myself too
I really really dont think its worse here than over there
By what metric do you base your statement
It wasn't the current Russians that did that
The current Russia is a successor of those states, though
Should you be though
Last thing I heard just 2 days ago your minister of economics pleaded how building of NS2 should not be politicised
It's a bit more than I'd like, but then I remember the -20 we're probably going to get in January and all of a sudden I'm good with this
Technological factors will prevent dropping gas or other fosilie fuels from providing the district heating needs
Mostly because in winter, cogeneration is extremely useful, the infrastructure is there and it's very expensive to replace
District heating with hot water is a very very good source of heating for high-density populated ares, the technology is robust and adaptable
It's way cheaper than electricity and for now also than low temperature district heating, which is achieved with wasted heat and heat pumps, which comes with its own challanges
Like it's not easy to make hot tap water with low temperature district heating, which raises risk of water-born patogens
Heck, heat pumps just now reached long term cost parity with gas, for the price of making 1 kwh, but still require substantially more initial investment, and have problems with winters below -15C.
So yeah, gas is here to stay, all we can do is diversify, insulate and renovate buildings, make hybrid systems
But gas will still be there in 20, 30, even 50 years, just hopefully at a smaller role
Yeah, geothermal is a godsend as far as becoming non-reliant on fossil fuels goes
Most other places can hope for low-temperature district heating at best by using a hybrid of heat pumps and solar arrays, with some electric and fossil backup
It's actually not easy at all, without a titanic investment and holistic approach which are not favored in modern market economies
It's first and foremost an economic problem
Let me explain why this is such a huge technological problem
Switch to electricity as the main source of heat will require the revamp of all electrical grids, in many cases a complete replacement will be required
Not just grids, most housing is not designed with electric consumption levels that accommodate heating
In some older buildings having a water boiler, an electric kettle and an oven on at hte same time could lead to a local black-out, and having electric heating is like adding an equivalent of 4-8 extra always-on kettles
Switch to electric heating will require systems that seasonally should be able to give out upwards to x10 (probably more) the nominal power consumption, specially in extra cold weather
This means that we will need that much more raw electric power during winter
I am not talking about the already existing day/nigh electrical use disparity which will become even more evident
No only that, but accommodating this disparity will lead to more energy loss in transfer
Mitigating these fluctuations is a very tough problem now, and will become even greater problem in the future
We will need to build pump storage or find a way to balance the grids
That's just one of the reasons why a total switch to electricity, when compare to the circulating insulated hot water systems, has huge technological challenges, and why some form of burning fuel will always be desired
There's also other kinds of civil engineering and industrial systems whose MO heavily relies on the existence of hot water district heating
As I mentioned it, the far more likely scenario is the switch to low temp systems, and there are some pilot projects being built rightn ow all across the world with some positive and some mixed results
Time will tell
This view is nothing to be proud of
So what ? Execute who needs to be executed, but this was good old medieval type display to satisfy the crowd
Government might have not got it
I've only seen them at the riga marathon
East German communists and their friends being afraid of losing their power and privileges I presume (which of course they did)
You have a Christmas market this year
A day trip to Tallinn, an overnight stay in Latvia or a two night trip (or an exhausting overnight trip) to Lithuania, you do the math
Oh, that's nice
We don't have one and I'm afraid a Christmas market here would be an uncontrollable experience
Stay safe
biggest economy, and so it also has the biggest interest for its nearby countries to not fucking die and go bankrupt since thats German markets where they make money
Would the solution be *final*?
This is pretty dank, if I do say so myself
Okay what kind of shitposting is this now
Please stop it, get some help

I'm more baffled that one of my country's representatives voted No on the directive but at the same time voted No on possible amendments
Why
I'm sure several people voted like that and overall the result of the first vote could be different
There's no way they are stopping a rebellion the size of the internet tho
TBH, 5 million is around 1% of EUs population

Not necessarily corrupt
50+ something old dudes and ladies are hardly experts on anything that involves IT, they have old fashion law degrees, and don't understand a single internet nuance
In other words, they aren't automatically corrupt, most likely they tech-dumb and their opinions are stuck in the 80-90s pre-internet era, with a pinch of shills among them to wave their fists at the internet
Fun fact: 11
November 1919 was a turning point in Latvian independence fights
So, today we celebrate this turning point, while the end of WWI is put in the background
Keep fighting at least the world will know in the worst case

Sometimes it feels like people driving cars think that they are still sitting in those carnival bumper cars instead of piloting a ton of steel at a speed that can kill
Not that the rest of the traffic participants are any better
God, I can't wait for automated cars to become mandatory
> Well, sometimes bikers seem to feel like THEY are the ones sitting in a 2 ton truck, industructible by human means
Oh, I completely agree
The things I have seen cyclists do (high speed corner cutting without knowing what is behind the corner; having no concept of what the specific traffic sign means while being completely sure they are in the right; driving in the opposite direction of the traffic etc
That is why I said that nihilism exhibited by certain drivers can also be observed in other traffic participants
It is not like cyclists/drivers/pedestrians come from different parts of society
As a cyclist myself I have come to the conclusion that following all the traffic rules is not the best way how to drive
The preferable method is by minimizing all possible contacts/conflicts with other people on the road (no matter if you are in the right or not)
ez kid, fat dub
Then there's Russia with roughly the same population as Japan

A lot of the places have contitution that says marriage is a union between man and a woman
And it's often controversial to propose major changes to it so issues like these are not addressed
Some places opt for some form of legal route that doesn't label it as marriage
But marriage on its own is pretty aged tradition and the way I see it, it should be a secondary term anyway as generally religious institutions practice it - I wouldn't force any religous institution to unify anyone they don't want as their whole process is based on opinions and traditions
Adults, however, should be able to legally form unions as they please but if we stray too far then where do we set boundaries - up to how many people can legally be in a union
At one point we will find people just making unions for legal reasons alone
For example back in Sovet Union, at some point, newly weds would get x amount of boxes of vodka from government so my dad's first student "marriage" was to just get free stuff
It's a shame to know my country doesn't allow gay marriage
Latvia and Lithuania soon will be in the light blue column
And thanks to western woke leftists - it's going to stay that way
If you marry elsewhere, it will be legally recognized, however, gay couples cannot marry in any form
But long will sun-light day last on 17th of January
So it's gonna be what a 5 minute day
Dont want to be nitpicky, but this isnt a castle
Its just a walled town
A castle would have a central keep of sorts
Baltic states escaped this fate in the chaos of 1990's, Baltic politicians of that era were quick enough in grabbing the opportunity to brake away while Russia was busy with their own problems
we too had Russian military bases here with a shit load of Russians soldiers just like Crimea, but using the disarray of recent USSR collapse and help from Balts living in USA, our politicians were able to make deals with Bill Clinton and Yeltsin that made sure Russians would leave, permanently, and would have no influence over those 3 little countries by military means
Ukraine failed to do it, they allowed Russian bases in Crimea to stay and didn't set clear goals for what their future will look like
and is now, 25 years later, they are paying the grim consequences of that
Sad of course, but then again it was sort of expected
There is no way Russia would allow Ukraine (or any other former USSR republic) to stay neutral while sitting in between NATO and Russia, Baltic leaders knew that already in 1991 and did what they could to make sure they wouldn't be caught in the crossfire
Ukraine, did not
I still can’t believe I live in this timeline
This shit sometimes feels absurd
Hope this shit closes mink farms for good
Poor little guys but I can imagine they already have pretty shitty lifes

Latvia is mostly green :)
Poland looks like coal paradise
Well, one should also take into account the market and sources
If you import electricity, you can import it from renewable sources at a different tariff, giving buying priority to green energy
having authoritarian leader who is not wanted by the people tends to have similar results across the board
aww man
It's much darker in Sweden than US
Sweden has less annual sunlight hours than Alaska does, much less continental USA
Light requires electricity
if it didnt happen where do they think all the jews went
Are those the  same 1,120 people
Also iit would be interesting to know how it was done
Oh jeez, I feel you
It was around +27C here today, our AC at work hasn't been installed yet, and the whole work day was like one long sauna session
I hiked along the entire Latvian-Estonian border line a couple of years ago (~350 km) and within that border alone there were plenty of tiny "international" bridges in all shapes and conditions
Basically every time a road crosses a border, since most of the border line is marked by a ditch
That's what she said
Whatever it is, it can't be worth it
Making a personal embargo to Poland
It'll be like 3 extra seconds per item in the supermarket just to check if it's not made in Poland, or designed in Poland, but until the ruling party changes, I'm willing to make that sacrifice
I once read some *very serious business* meme that -%sales and having the lowest price isn't a viable business strategy
Oh my how wrong that memer was

I've been there, beautiful city
I was getting rather insulted until I saw Papal States
Kingdom of Heaven FTW
I'm okay with this
Haha, tbh, I am kind of honoured you'd put Latvia's name there instead of alternatives . What did we do
Sidenote: as always the best thing about these posts is reading through comments of Scandinavians insulting each other

Who gives the most aid to Serbia
Eu has given 1 billion 800 million dollars
Kosovo is not a part of Serbia
>How about they pay for the damage they caused in 1999
you mean for the wars Serbs started and refused to end and then had the audacity to attack and kill UN peacekeepers
I think its them who should pay , not the other way around
> but that's just like your opinion dude
There's always two sides in every conflict
yes, sure
Nazis also had some good points then
>I'm staying not everything is exactly like your media made you believe
there is no excuse for this , this is in line with what Nazis did, pure and simple
Motives and justification same as Serbian crime, just the numbers are different
Not sure how this helps your view there
Want to say ''We Nazis is oke because 70 years ago other Nazis did it too
>I'll help you
Thousands
8,372 killed by execution and rape in Srebrenica
NATO bombing : Human Rights Watch estimate: 489–528 civilians
yea try again mate , not even close
And NATO action did actually end the war and put a end to all this
What did Serbian actions did
Ahh right, try to ethnically cleanse whole regions of people they didn't like
You seriously going to compare the 2
It doesnt look to good now does it
> Human rights watch is biased
right, and glorious Serbian authoritarian dictatorship of that time is not
Sure , those guys were the truthful ones
It's located in former East Germany
Everything is cheaper
Isn't that technically an arrest, albeit made in an oppressive dictatorship, rather than abduction
But is it like semi-legal arrest of someone who perhaps does not like Lukashenko's government or do they e.g. take random persons from streets to woods for no reason connected to being police/regime other than it giving them more ability to do so
There are different implications between the two
No, but your regime probably does, so if it's an arrest then it indicates that something is wrong with the country, not just criminal activity, plus if it is criminal activity by police force that is not sanctioned/controled by the regime then maybe things have gone even worse than before
What is going on right now
There were protests with reports of pretty wild police violence, but now have they managed to oppress most of protests
Is it still the same with protests going on and the regime policing around
Is it worse

Norway and Switzerland are in a far different relationship with EU than UK now is
they are almost members of EU formally since they abide by most of its laws (especially Switzerland, whos economy is very much tied with EU as this point), UK said it didn't want to abide any of them
So no, UK is not even the same group
> The UK is continuing to abide by many EU regulations
its a very wide and varied group and no you cant just bunch them together
UK right now towards EU has the same kind of relationship as Canada, and no its not ''continuing to abide by many EU regulations'', thats just flat out not true
Norway and Switzerland have all of them (these 15 at least)
So no, UK is not like them, not even anything near it
i love old European style architecture
Are those Bauhaus style buildings
I believe at least in Latvia's case its due to open borders and emigration

There's no difference between the USSR and Nazi Germany
What happened there
Road broke
I've heard that in Belgium some parents ask rent from their kids once they turn 18
I've seen this said a few times and every time I think - ah, there's the difference in mentality
To me, contributing to household expenses means buying some groceries and household items, covering other costs when it makes sense (when you're near a shop anyway, when you have more time, when you have ready cash and parents don't etc
It's all flexible and nobody keeps track, you go by feeling
It's never (and my parents would consider it crazy to ask) a set amount every month
Because when you expect a certain amount at a certain day every week/month, then I call it "rent" no matter where the money goes after
Of course, some kids can be assholes and this "sense of duty" based system won't work for everyone
But I've never met anyone in my country who would be charged rent (a specific amount of money) by their parents
I wasn't arguing that it's a lot of money or not fair
I'm just saying that in different countries you look at these things differently - we would call these €2-300 "rent", and it doesn't happen a lot
We would most likely contribute by buying goods instead of transferring money
It's just a different approach, I was pointing *that* out
So they created a bit of fake news just to create outrage at Russia over nothing

And a very tasty one
I put on some 4 kilos in 2 weeks while there despite doing a lots of walking up and down the hills in merciless heat most of the time

I still am amazed how I got back home alive
An insane explosion happened right across the street from my house, Latvia
[More] [footage]  here's [another angle] from the building right by it
I tried posting mine but sadly instagram links get removed here
It was insane, my whole house shook to the core and ears were ringing
I live about 100meters from that building so yeah, first time experiencing something so crazy and unexpected, considering it happened at 1:20am
It's been about 7 hours since this happened and things are finally calm, no firefighters or medics outside and just people taking care of the rubble
There's no official cause yet, but people suspect a gas leak explosion
[It's all over news] but obviously they're [in latvian] so yall probably wont get too much info out of it
So far only 1 person has been confirmed dead and about 8 injured, but it's hard to imagine the number is that small considering a huge chunk of a building straight up vanished
People are already saying that 2020 isn't giving up till the last second
Imagine that there probably was a family ready to celebrate new years in one of those apartments
*Edit:* Apparantly the newest info from experts is that it wasn't a gas explosion, which is very curious
A criminal investigation has begun
Here's [a local news source in English
The final numbers are lucky since many apartments in that building were thankfully empty
1 dead and 6 injured, 2 with minor wounds
Would you say the emergency response was fast and sufficient
> People are already saying that 2020 isn't giving up till the last second
We also had a record Covid case number and record positive test rate today
We'll probably soon be near the top in Europe per capita
And people are still planning NY parties even with the curfew in effect
The gas company says it's not gas
In that house had only one apartment connected to the gas, and that apartment was on the other side of the house and the gas infrastructure doesn't seem to be damaged
That doesn't exclude the possibility that the apartment had their own portable gas cylinder
Investigation is ongoing
Melnsila 2
Well it's actually our capital Riga, which is run-down as well, particularly thanks to the 10 year reign of the party Saskaņa. The cities in regions are usually better-maintained and more aesthetically pleasing than our own capital
But with the new mayor, I hope the situation will change
I don't know, apart from the graffiti and the obvious pile of debris and destruction it doesn't look all that run down
The lighting is really bad but it just looks like any random pre-war building
Looking at it in streetview, it could probably do with a thorough cleaning and a coat of paint but I've seen buildings of similar (and worse) decrepitude in many major European capitals
Riga
Oh for sure, there were emergency services, firefighters and cops all around
Definitely more than enough
The only thing I could mention is that while watching it all happen from my window, firefighters came in last
Cops and medics where there almost instantly it seemed like
Gas ovens and stoves are the best
We have frequent power outages and people like to be able to cook or boil water in such cases
Not in Riga
There power outages are a rare thing
Growing up in an apartment in Purvciems I dont remember having any power outages
Real reason why most people still use gas stoves is because gas is way cheaper than electricity
For cooking
Bruh, tell Warsaw it be lookin hella fine lately
Terrible disgrace for Dutch soldiers
I get that they where outnumbered and outgunned and its easy for me to be all righteous sitting in my cozy office job, but in this occasion there was no alternative to courage, just shame
Survivors guilt is a real thing even for helpless civilians, but what if you are armed soldier with a task to protect the people being slaughtered
This is fucked up
We haven't learned this because it was new stuff at the time
News, not history
Which is one of the problems with learning history in school, your are in 5th grade, learning stuff that happened 15 years ago, or whatever book you government approved most recently, but since you don't delve into politics on your free time - everything that happened after that flies above your head until you are older and take an interest
I agree, but then again standards for soldiers are a bit higher then for middle aged professional whos a bit on the chubby side
How dare I expect sense of duty, courage and integrity from soldiers
Dying while protecting civilians who you are tasked to protect is not death for nothing
Also an argument could be made that some ragtag militia form backwater bumblefuck would not even dare to attack if some determination to resist had been demonstrated
Right wing
You mean, like conservative leaning people or what exactly
Chill guys
There is a legitimate discussion buried under these insults, don't throw the baby out with the bathwater

Louis XIV once has said 'L'etat c'est moi' ('I am the state')
ahem, f*ck commies, f*ck soviets, f*ck stalin, f*ck the revolution
All of the occupied countries would be way, way better off without the sickness that the rabid communist dictators brought onto this world
nobudy says Baltic SS legions were "liberators" , and only the early units were volunteer based (which why they were very small in size, they grew into whole legions only after people were being forcefully conscripted)
And by the way, Nazi ideology is banned and attacked in Baltics just like the Communists, so I dont understand why people try to pose this view that somehow if Soviets are bad somewhere then Nazis must be good, no they are not both are shit on
He is arguing against you blatantly trying to derail this post
> These units were still ran by Nazis
nobudy has ever said it wasnt , it was part of SS of course it was
>many of the men sympathised with the Nazis
''many'' is the debatable part, if there is conscription there is no real way to prove if you are sympathizing or you are just doing what you are told so you dont get shot or sent to concentration camp as a deserter (which was common)
This is a totalitarian system that was desperate for any fighting men it could get at all costs by 1942 already
>I had some person earlier tell me how these SS units weren't Nazis
depends on what exactly you mean by it
You mean the overall organisation
Of course it was Nazi creation and commanded
But if you call all of its members ''Nazis'', that would not be correct since they didnt join it out of free choice
Thats like saying all Red army units and soldiers were ''Communists'', they were not for that same principle, you did as you are told and nobudy asked or cared if you ''believed in Lenin and his ideology''
> but I still feel that they weren't heroes
they are portrayed as ''heroes'' here, but as victims who for more than 50 years were judged guilty of things they had no influence over
Whats where the Latvian position stands . The ''Latvian legion day'' is not a celebration day, but a day of mourning
It seems thats something a lot of people seem to not understand
>Then we agree that they were Nazis since they fought for Nazi Germany
if you are forced to fight, are you also part of that philosophy
I dont think ''I am doing this so I dont die and my family doesnt die'' counts as ''I am a Nazi''. Nazi implies you are member and supported of their general philosophy and ideology
>I have no issues with agreeing that Latvians conscripted into the Red Army were Soviets
Soviets
not Communists then
Those words are not the same
Don't judge dude, he might be, he might not be
Not surprising my country out of all 3 would have the most porn stars, ofcourse we are the most depressed, we have the worst education system, and those Estonians and Lithuanians are saying their life is shit

Prostitution is legal
We should be proud
First of all I would like to see the list because I suspect bullshit
There's no reason for the difference to be so big among Baltic countries
It's not what these other guys are saying, it doesn't have anything to do with there being more Russians or us being poorer (we are not that far from Estonia and decently close to Estonia) it's that prostitution is legal in Latvia

Every new case we get in Latvia for the past week has been 100% people coming from Sweden
is this the kinda cabin Norwegians call hytta
Trust me, as a Latvian living in Scotland I've had the same issue - "Oh you're from Latvia
Vilnius is a beautiful city
Haha, that'd mean they know the difference between the 2 countries
The only 2 countries they know the locations of are UK and Spain
As a Latvian studying Lithuanian language I can say that the languages are really different and further than Dutch is to German
Latvian has the stress always on the first syllable while Lithuanian has a mobile stress system where it changes from word to word
There are tons of False friends in our languages and you just can't assume their meaning, for example:
palikt = to stay (in LV)
palikti = to leave (in LT)
lithuanian doesn't sound anything like russian to me

If you drive too fast in Malta, you can fly off of the island

What memo
Did The-Gateway-To-France send them any memo
Don't think so - they have enough regions which would like to break off :)
They have their own language that's actually being spoken by the people
I heard more Maltese during 2 weeks that I spent in Malta than Irish during 4 years that I spent in Ireland
Believe or not, but it's possible to keep your native language and still have English as an official language
But for some reason they teach Irish in every school
Not just in those that are located in the Gaeltacht
What's the point
I'm pretty sure they don't teach Basque in Paris and Madrid
In the exports section don’t forget about Adol
never mind, we don’t talk about that
No, not much
They robbed all the Central and Eastern European states after WW2 as ''reparations'', took anything that was valuable back to USSR and left their ''Warsaw pact allies'' with crap
Its more like they advance their own technology on the expense of their neighbors, not the there way around

Not as impressive as [this
There was a fire in a landfill in Latvia [last year] (link in latvian, at least there's a video), as it later turned out, it had some ''irregularities'' in regards to what and how much was stored there, everyone was quite panicked
If we had even a tenth of 73 fires/year, we would probably be stocking up on rations and gas masks

As I like to say, you can take Latvia out of Eastern Europe, but you can't take Eastern Europe out of Latvia
But ot be fair, due to centuries of living on the border and being under powers from north, east and west, it's a bit of everyhting
This map feels like a shitpost for people who think that the EU is going to evolve into a federal state
I don't know about Baltic states tho
Central, northern, easthern
Not really
I think the Baltic states being lumped in with Central Europe, but because they aren’t very similar to Northern or Eastern Europe, can’t you just call them North Eastern Europe
The Balkans are classified as south-eastern
right i've heard eastern, i've heard northern, i've heard north-eastern, this is a fucking new one wow
"Very very slowly"... I see what you did there
For the last 100 years we kinda are
thats why all our history books are from the perspective that germans were assholes that conquered our tribespeople for really no reason
Huh, I can't be only one disturbed by colour choice in this graph
It seems more like they try to portray themselves as true nation's Patriots and defenders against evil foreign things

We were, but since our disfunctional drug addict parents lost their rights on us, we were sepperated - you eventually moved to Mr
Polska house, while i moved to Ms
Deutschland house
It was
more or less fine
You had very rich upbringing and had great time, while i had strict, but in the end much better family than our previous one
But then Russian Family decided to kidnap us
Apparently they knew we were siblings, so decided they could get more money out of it
they never received any money and eventually forced us to be their children instead
Me, being 15, and you 17 it was very difficult time, since we werent easily susceptible children anymore
The beatings, shouting
then Ms
Deutshcla d, after 3 painful years finally found us
Who knew she was an agent after all these years i was with her
The next year was good, but then Russians came back
They killed Ms
Deutschland and kidnapped us again
Those were gruesome 10 months
living in that pit, with only bars covering us from the elements of outside

is that we
are back together again, yes, brother
Give me my infinite money to rewrite the history books, ffs already
Actually, I could never imagine Lithuania and Latvia in war against each other
2 years since we had a winter this cold
I dont have a problem with cold weather but my cars doors were frozen shut at -19C which is annoying
Also went to a self service car wash the other day and left with a thick layer of ice on my car because everything freezes almost instantly in this weather
This is unusual only because it’s like that now
It should’ve been like this in December/January
welcome global warming :D
they all look so happy :)

Also, I am not sure why you thought you need a precision to 3 decimal points there
</sarcasm>
Anyway, sounds like someone is trying to exaggerate the numbers (and thus damaging an actually decent cause)
The problem is that it can't be dealt with
There are some things which protesters are ignoring
Green energy is more expensive, so production plants, which are using much electricity or heat will loose competitiveness to other countries, which is no so green
They will bankrupt or will go abroad
That happened to only metallurgical plant in Latvia, which lose competitiveness to Chinese steel, because our tariff on electricity contain part which are used to support green energy and that was too much
The other thing is that green energy, due to fact that green energy producers are receiving subsidies, is a nice source of corruption itself
( Like a garbage business )
That happened in Latvia too, where rich families and previous politicians are doing both green energy and garbage business
The business is big, but produced part of the green energy -small
Yeah it can in places like Netherlands, Germany etc, but it can't be dealt in places like Eastern Europe, or even in 3rd world countries its worse
Only you need The World Illuminati government for that
Going on streets and protesting is always an option
And easy to accomplish
Not true

>The Schuman plan is one of the main reasons for the long peace, with the economic integration of Europe war is now unthinkable in Europe and the relations between Germany and France have never been higher
Aging societies don't fight wars

Should r/russia remain hardcore propoganda machine for kremlin or should anything be done
Like removing mods or something
They exist so that Putin can look reasonable compared to them
The problem is that brexiters don't want a deal that's similar to those of Norway or Switzerland
If they wanted that then there would not be any problems - the EU would sign that deal immediately
Unlike Norway and Switzerland the UK is not even in Schengen area, for example
But instead they want to crash out with no deal whatsoever
Even May's deal makes the UK less integrated with the EU than EEA/Switzerland
I don't mind them using a loophole if there is one
And reportedly it's already being fixed, so some of you that are angry about companies not paying taxes you want them to pay, soon they will have to find another loophole
expensive but itll be good
This kind of weather is very hard to bear
Not even the night gives respite
I hope most people have either stone homes or A/Cs
they can, but why should they if they can buy them from Germans and not deal with the problems
And I thought it was CS:GO reference lol
There is a map name "Lake" with a house similar to this
Eh, I don't know
A lot of people I know who would have been religious are instead into some weird esoteric stuff or a choose-your-own-adventure style of exploration into Eastern stuff, or some other random crap, like they're "not religious but spiritual," etc
Graphs like these don't signify the rise of logic and pure thought that you might want to see
People don't change that fast; I bet a lot of them are still into magical thinking
At least with religion and Christianity it's a familiar and predictable form of insanity
With the weird crap floating around today, who knows
Latvia — some weird mix between the two
\>Lithuania hardly became Christian voluntary, it took a full Crusade to "convince" them to convert
Although to be fair the same is true for northern Germany and the Netherlands and many areas of Europe
&#x200B;
And one of those 'many areas'  would happen to be Estonia (+Latvia=Livonia)
It's even exactly the same crusade
Crusade does not explain religious differences between very catholic Lithuania+Latgale and very agnostic rest of Latvia+Estonia
"Sasodīts" is what a Ned Flanders character would say, something along the lines of "gosh darn it". In no way is it similar to actual speech patterns of real people
Maybe some little old lady would say that in polite company when she's dropped her crocheting needles, although I suspect that she's seen more than you think and could outdo a drunken stevedore in profanity
"Sasodīts" is pretty pg, translated it means "damned". If you wanted to be more hip you'd definitely use something like "bļa" which as you might guess is just the translitered Russian "blyat". We use a lot of Russian swear words
Sameish for Latvia
If it's media or tv then sasodīts, if it's everyday, blyatj it is then

Making things space worthy is extremely valuable
In space *nothing* is easy
So you adapt - make electronics more resilient, create new medicine for astronauts, extreme resource conservation and recycling, literally be forced to invent new things
Innovation won’t take place just like that and space is a great way to stimulate it along
Just better be super sure that the Chinese, Indians, Russians, Americans are going to do it

This is giving me eurovision vibes
Welcome, Bulgaria
Is this a list of countries with common sense
Does Russia have a list with their client states as well
Germany and France would be top positions
Finland and Russia had horrible relations for most of the time Finland has existed as independent country (Soviet Moscow's view was that Finland as a state is a temporary mistake that will be fixed soon, just like the Baltic states), only reason it changed was Cold war made it risky for Soviets to keep this hostility and ''we want to destroy you, just you wait'' attitude due to fear that NATO could use that against them, so they pretended that they are on good terms
and even then, both sides kept battle ready armies at all times pointed at each other, all the way to modern day actually
Finland still maintains massive military, biggest artillery force in Northern Europe and full on conscription for all of its males age 18+, and its no secret towards who its all aimed at
''good neighbors'' don't do that
Russia keeps Finland alone now, because Finnish military has grown so strong in the last 30 years that Russia cant afford to bully them anymore how they used to
2008 war
I know, but again, they kind of had a special situation going on there that allowed them to be in that possiton
many other countries did not, such as Poland or Czechoslovakia, Soviets didn't even want to contemplate these places not being under iron fist of Moscow
So saying ''just be like Finland'' is naive, most simply even have such a choice
>You have to count in finlandization
I know what that is, but again, they kind of had a special situation going on there that allowed them to be in that possiton to begin with
many other countries did not, such as Poland or Czechoslovakia, Soviets didn't even want to contemplate these places not being under iron fist of Moscow and their occupation
So saying ''just be like Finland'' is naive, most simply dont have such a choice
Ukraine nowadays doesn't have either, for example (Russia didnt even try some sort of dialogue with Ukrainians before they annexed Crimea the way they did with Finland, they just forced their rule and thats it)
> So while the Baltic countries are eager to wave middle fingers at Russia because they believe in their friend United States
Baltic states do it, because Baltic states have no such luxery as what Finland has
I dont think many people know, but Baltic states also declared neutrality and expressed their desire to stay out of World war 2 and not pick sides exactly the same as Finland did
Soviets came and forced their rule anyway
Moscow never even wanted to negotiate such a thing as these countries not ''belong to them'', not then not now either
Only thing that kept them away was American pressure
>It doesn't mean Finlandization, but a constant converstation
There was a attempt of such a thing in 1990's between Baltic governments and Boris Yeltsin right after USSR collapsed
It didnt lead anymore, because frankly Russia didn't want it to lead anywhere, they didnt even want to remove their military bases from Baltic states until Americans straight up threaten them with economic embargo if they don't. There cant be a ''conversation'' if one side is not interested in any sort of compromise , its just naive
Its been an official and standard policy of Finnish state since its very creation more than 100 years ago (it has never been canceled since then)
So for most Finns it's just ''normal'' part of life and how it should be and how it always has been
In fact a lot of countries in this region (except mine lol, Latvia) have military conscription (Finland, Estonia also since creation of their state, Sweden, Norway, Lithuania too)
because, you know, Russia is right there and its such a ''good'' and ''friendly'' neighbor
There are even talks in Latvia now that maybe we should restart it back again, because we also had military conscription until 2007 when it was deemed unnecessary due to NATO membership
WHAT THE FUCK

The Yugoslav Wars were a series of separate but related ethnic conflicts, wars of independence and insurgencies fought in the former Yugoslavia from 1991 to 2001, which led to the breakup of the Yugoslav state
Its constituent republics declared independence, despite unresolved tensions between ethnic minorities in the new countries, fueling the wars
Also Estonia did Srebrenica

Jesus christ my country is red
Latvia need 2nd amendment :)
Latvian here: the story is similar to Russia - Russian speaking bums get super drunk and start beating each other, often resulting in death
So the cause to all of this is poverty and alchohol
That's because that number is wrong
Sort of
Every country calculates total homicides differently
There was a news story about this and at the and no one really knew why this number is so high and where it comes from
Poverty and alcohol
[Poverty] is very prevelant in Latvia, I speak from life experiences
And i knoe you are 100% bullshitting if you say you dont know anyone that is poor
Every single person in my village lived with what is called extreme material deficiency, and some of them couldnt even feed themselves without borrowing money
[Map] which points out Latvia is a hub for Russian organised crime into Europe
When it comes to minimum wage adjusted for prices in a given country(PPS), Latvia is at the bottom of the EU, so if you say there is not a lot of poverty in Latvia that is a complete and utter lie
[Proof for you, who] in denial]
Well maybe you grew up lucky not seeing poverty but trust me my friend poverty is much more common than wealth here, most people i know lived very poor since im from the countryside in Zemgale
Latvia is indeed one of the major Russian crime hubs outside of Russia, the mafia is still prevelant hete, murders happen
You know that Latvians and Russians often have a natural hatred between them, not me personally but most of my family hates Russians for example
London is literally the 1 place in the UK that is safer than Latvia, every other part of the UK is objectively much safer than Latvia
My house had been broken into a few times in Latvia, while living in a pretty safe area for Latvian standards, if you left your bike outside a store, or forgot your phone or something it is very likely they will get robbed, while in the Uk you dont have to really worry about this
Oh and my neighbour in Latvia was a convincted rapist and murderer, and not just for one case and he only got 15 years in prison and now freely walks my town and its pretty normal, I havent met anyone in the UK who has done more than petty crime
Source: Lived most of my life in the countryside of Zemgale, some in the outskirts of Riga and now in the UK for a few years
Ah I love getting downvoted for pointing out this man is clearly in denial about the state of Latvia, cause it clearly has poverty everywhere, and crime, and racism against Russians(and vice versa for Latvians)

There’s like one road, overtaking is tricky, and it’s lined with cops on the lookout for speeding tourists
By 2040 there will be 130 km/h autobahn from Lithuania's border to Estonias
Its 1200 km of autobahns
Highway here in Latvia is some road with 90 km/h limit
Ok I fucked up little bit
By 2040 there will be 1200 km of autobahns across all of Latvia
Highways - 90km/h limit
Autobahn - 130 km/h limit
In Latvia
I do miss Lats mainly because of sentimental values from growing up with them
But at the same time having Euro is so much more convenient

We have the same in Latvia
Each person can chop 1 tree for free
Is there an app for it or what
In Latvia anyone can chop down a singe tree for their home, if it's a state owned firest
Haven't heard that anyone would chop a bunch and go selling, besides, if you want to sell, you probably mustdeclare the origin
> You don't need any apps when you have Lembergs and Saskaņā to tell you how great things are

Yeah well Lembergs is not in a good situation now and Saskaņā-we'll see

Yes forests are total fault for this map
Not only Scandinavian, Baltic and Belarus forests are absent, but also there are not forests in the mountains of Carpats, Balkans and Caucasus
Russian TV Zvezda (former Soviet army TV channel) is so notorious for its false narrative, that it may be regarded as specializing in pure fiction
[Here on YouTube you can see a short video] highlighting some absurd claims in regards of a particular propaganda broadcast related to Latvia some years ago
It is in Russian, but has English subtitles on CC
The shamelessness of these evil clowns of the false Russian propaganda is astonishing
They went even as far as to claim that [the Latvian citizens murdered by Soviet secret police] after invasion of 1940 were actually victims of "Fascists".
I wonder if people who produce lies so cynical are mentally healthy
I guess that is just not possible
in Soviet Russia
you are always the Fashist
> since this is the original false flag that gave them the casus belli
Russians were doing a lot of strange things on their borders
In Latvia they [crossed the border just few days before invasion of 1940 and murdered some border guards and their family members] without any obvious reason
Unless intimidation was their reason
well surely if someone tries to resist peaceful and prefect Soviet union, they must be some kind of fahists sympathizers, there's just no other way someone with do such a thing  /s
STOP BEING FRIENDS WITH LATVIA and
Finland
and everyone else
because that's making us scared
Hey now
The plan was to quickly conquer tiny Russia and to use it's vast resources and huge army to fight against the Germans
Nobody in their right mind would pass such an opportunity

Does this mean cheaper PlayStations in the EU
In Latvia there are clases with 30 people and some with 10 in the same city
This is slightly misleading
In cities, average class size would be around 20-23, but we still have a lot of small rural schools (a vestige from soviet times), they bring the number down, since they barely can get a single class filled with 8-12 children

It is amazing how 1 person is destroying more than half a century long relationships between countries
And this is petty, but I almost would want for EU to start threatening USA with our own import taxes from USA, because they aren't building/creating it here
But that wouldn't be fair to the majority of the people who didn't want him
But USA really needs to check itself in a mirror and understand how did they manage to get a racist kid as the Free World leader
As long as you won't take UK and USA mantle of who can trumph who(no pun intended ), and do something stupid, like a Le Pen, we will be fine, hopefully
He is the next POTUS of course it is a big deal, he isn't some average Joe from the street, a person can't get to his position, unless majority of people want him there(not this time by a majority, but by an old system), so it wouldn't be incorrect for me to listen to him and be amazed, what stupid shit he thinks of today
And he didn't supposedly told just this time, but several times about these topics the same rhetoric
Well the Iraq invasion was sketchy at best
If the information would have been correct about WMD, then USA would see you as a friend who didn't believe him, and left him to fend for himself
Even if Germany would reduce their tax to the same as USA, you still couldn't import any vehicle made in USA
Because USA manufactured cars don't reach the minimum level of CO2 emissions, liter of fuel per 100 km, and overall they are to clunky for everyday use
That is why USA manufacturers have specific factories in EU, where you make editions of some models, which are compatible with the regulations
And guess what ? those cars don't have to pay import tax
Amen
Corruption and greed is a powerful enemy
You either die as a hero, or live long enough to become the villain
This I think is a great quote for the situation in USA right now
They are planning to team up with russia, a +- working health care system being trashed and being replaced by bigly words, racism, sexism, is going to be on a huge rise, + the incompetence of the police force there is amazing, religion fanatism still, for example abortion bans, even thought the republicans, pro-life don't give a shit about the kid when it is born, and overall bad education system has made all this shit possible

Grandpa was like that, when he dies we found he was stacking "just in case" non-perishables for years, well into break up of USSR, all because of the 32-33 famine in USSR
Also knew a woman who lived through Leningrad blockade, for her the only "sweet" thing she knew for many years were onions
Honestly, with how crap my uni experience was, and how crap most of my friends uni experience has been, I'm not even mad at Latvia being behind Lithuania and Estonia
So many useless degrees, or ones that you do just to get the paper saying you did them, not because of the knowledge you gain
By hottest you mean what
German is an official language there so it makes perfect sense
Way too high
Why
Yeah - this is why it's \~30% not 80-90+%.
Sounds about right to me
Similar to Italy, Romania, Portugal
Also - you mentioned Germany
When I was in Germany - I visited a cinema in Berlin
And the movie was in English
I expected German subtitles, but there weren't any
In my country all movies have subtitles in Latvian and Russian
But in some parts of Germany - it's apparently not necessary - why
I remember - that Cinema was in Sony Center Berlin
Maybe that's an anomaly, but apparently it can stay profitable even without dubbing or subtitling movies
The cinema was full of people when I was there
America's on the wrong side /s
Not sure about the competition but these are the prices in Latvia from the most well-known company [screenshot] .
They also provide TV
> Russians are slim fit and healthy people
except for drinking and smoking
Ööuklubi ^^
Here here
Love you guys also stop pissing on our monutments
I wish it wouldn't be this hot
I can barely work from home now
Please, don't curse it
I like it
I imagined that it will start to rain again here and felt sad
I want hot summer
Sorry, but I'm happy and can't believe it
It's a bot
TIL that 95% > 96%
Ok, one obviously does not build a bridge for a river over a river just for shits and giggles
But for the love of god, I can't imagine what is that reason
Is it to do with high-ground, as in a water reservoir would get emptied if both water way would get connected directly
Yes, but why build an aqueduct
Why not just dig a canal, which to me sounds a lot cheaper
Protestant master race
Ironically, the Swedish occupation in Latvia is regarded fondly and the Russian Empire is when it all went (back) to shit
I hope that was the last time we hit 37
8 degrees cause I’m so used to the cold weather that I’d die of heatstroke
Ive had up to 40 degrees in my yard but i guess we keep our recieds low to not harm other countries or something
I would be cooking if I would be outside and it is like 40°C or more and we are in countryside so cooling isn't the best, only ones that come up to mind are: we have 2 fans, I can go swimming or just cool off with that ¿thing what makes water to mist
Maybe they could call it Greenland
I suppose it is ever more shadowy organizations controlling the leaders of the previous organizations
I see no other way it could go if we follow this track of reasoning
The problem is that you can assert literally anything, as you do, and since you are asserting that there are specific organizations having specific influence I'm extrapolating to the only plausible conclusion
That saif organizations too have leaders that in turn need to keep their supporters loyal and would inevitably have to to turn to yet further organizations
Countries and their leaders are just another set of organizations so whatever applies to them applies down the line
In real world is often subtler than that, *influence* is easier and often more cost effective than some form of bribery and there's a myriad of ways to achieve that
Influence not the one way road you describe, it runs both ways and spans the world in an entanglement of both personal and organizational contacts
The notion that a leader is given a turnkey position with no say in it is so simplistic to be almost naive
They will bring their personal network, gain some of the network of their predecestor and the process will strengthen some of those connections and weaken others
The end result might be essentially the same, it may be changed a little or it may also result in significant change, for better or worse, down the line as that mess plays itself out
This, of course, applies to all of us
It's just that influencial people tend to have ties with other influencial people, meaning that politicians, almost invariably will not be strongly influenced by any given voter not on that list
Money too is both the game of influencial people as well as political campaigns
It's hardly surprising that is a significant part if the game
Nonetheless people are people, not economic automatons, so social and factual influence (NGOs, scientists, celebrities, etc
) also matters a great deal
TL;DR: It's not a figure head thing, start by avoiding politicians who only travel in circles you find questionable
Trump being a prime example of how it plays out when no one with any sense has any influence on a politician with no clue about anything
What on earth
Soon You may be able to photograph also the Baltics
Is there a version without captions
That’s a nice looking Christmas tree
Yes
Maps like these always spark interesting discussions
In Latvia we have the light version explaining maps like these
* Jānis is rich and eats only steaks
* Māris is poor and can afford to eat only cabbage
* Statistically they both are well off eating meat filled cabbage rolls (Kāpostu Tīteņi)
There of course is a better version of the story which includes wives of a village :)
As someone who has emigrated from Latvia to Netherlands, Norway and to C.America, would you believe me when I say that in a lot of cases, in poorer countries food and basics are actually more expensive than rich countries
Whats the other version :D
Latvia is pretty cool

Yaay, thanks a lot everyone for kind and heart warming words
Yay
I am happy to see that mycountry is in the front page of reddit
99th birthday
Thanks <3
Much love, cheers
Also important to note that Latvia turns 100 next year
Most of Latvia's renewable energy comes from hydroelectric dams
So the wind turbines and solar panels may be a bit misleading
Cheers
It's mostly due to hydropower though
One of the most beautiful riverside landscapes was destroyed and went underwater to power the expansion of the capital with ugly soviet block buildings for foreign soviet workers to live in under the USSR
Pretty sad
Thanks and let me improve that for you
"Laimīgu neatkarības dienu, Latvija
" :)
A (crappy) [picture] I took today of your lads
Was surprised as well
I was searching for this comment lol
It's really bad as it means we are dying out .
That made me laugh, thanks :D
(Also, yay, potato
Žmoğis te stāstīs par zirgu galvām... :D
Despite your positive comment, most Latvians actually consider us the  least improved country of the 3 Baltic states
We are always just below Lithuania's ratings and way below Estonia's.
There are few upsides, tho
So its not that bad after all
Latvians are still Latvians even if they're living in London, Dublin, or Stockholm
Cheers mate
Dude 1
70 rate means we are dying out even without emigration
While we sell Estonians cheap booze, we go to Lithuania and buy cheap(er) food, clothing and even cars
So that pretty much evens out
They buy from us building materials, but as far as I know that is definitely not that widespread
Maybe some Lithuanian redditor can tell us more
More of these kind of photos
