despite what /u/Thegreatflea says, foreign soldier graves are a long time problem with Russia
even the linked article above is from 6 months ago and it is about a recent journalist trip to see what is happening in Russia over years
Russia is clearly breaking the international treaty with us but the bones in a landfill are not a direct result of our removing the statue 2 weeks ago
Slovakia same, a garbage man
in Slovakia, garbage men are poor, often gypsies, of course also essential, but you don't want to become one either
Here in Czechia I have a McDo nearby and they announce an initial salary that I think I could live with
And if I and the wife had that salary we could probably live similar life that we do now, except for vacations abroad and retirement savings, I mean they make close to what we spend
sorry but that is not a definition of a tourist trap
in our tourist traps, you pay, but for fake shit that is nothing like the local culture
we have various museums of sex and spiders and torture and feed people "traditional old Czech" chimney cakes that nobody local ever seen
I enjoyed my 2 hours in the center of Pisa
a sandwich at a square, an espresso, walk to another square, rest in the shadow, take another street back
look at the restaurant fronts, think why they are offering sicilian dishes
:-)
thanks for writing this
to consider a whole city with people living there as a tourist trap or uninteresting is ignorant
we are not talking about some earthquake or communist stricken spot
we had a very enjoyable tour by a beefeater so the visit also doubled as a standup comedy
but still, at the time, for an eastern european salary it was a hit
I would say that Czech and Slovak language a re great answer to this question
After a bit of exposure you understand everything but when you try to speak the other language, it sounds like you're mad
most Czechs and Slovaks would claim that they speak the other language though
why don't you make your own
OK I live in Czechia but our bread is probably similar to the German one
my wife makes it ocassionaly with her own sourdough starter, it takes some time but really not much work goes in it
thanks Austria for great skiing resorts
especially this year it is a gift from heaven
and for the music
and a wienerschnitzel (sorry for not giving proper credit)
and taking in Czechoslovak immigrants
there's probably much more
but please keep your mozartkugeln
yeah fucking Iceland
Austria was with you for much longer than Slovakia
Polish mayo
is it a thing
Until the end of World War I, Liechtenstein was closely tied first to the Austrian Empire and later to Austria-Hungary; the ruling princes continued to derive much of their wealth from estates in the Habsburg territories, and spent much of their time at their two palaces in Vienna
The economic devastation caused by the war forced the country to conclude a customs and monetary union with its other neighbour, Switzerland
says wikipedia, not me
and a super expensive highway vignette
hm this week I may go to PL, I'll check it out
normally, I avoid everything that is not Hellman's... any other Polish food tips, outside of krowky
I remember that there was only a yearly one and that my colleagues planned crazy routes to circumvent it
Hopefully the Slovenes realized how jammed are their villages on the slow roads to Croatia and changed this policy
:-)) I am in tears with lost Czech (and surely also Slovak) tourists
having high price is smart from you, like a bridge toll
And I’d rather pay for the highway, these people don’t value their time (or you’re really expensive)
But I go to Italy
Are we talking about the australian beer now
remember Johnny Bravo
o LEGO vna
cool
As a Brit use any accent north of London
When I stayed in Scotland, it took me three days until I started to understand things and I was at C1 level
Also fuck Yorkshire accents
For some reason Scottish English sounded to me like pirate speech too, but then again, I am no accent expert, I just find them interesting
I, a Slovak, always understand when somebody insults me in Hungarian
It's enough to learn a couple of animal names and a word for dick
No, only one word but I would know it’s very vulgar
It makes me sad that with Hungarian you must really learn every word, there are no similarities and even knowledge of other languages doesn’t help
It is a turn
And in other languages, it is a turn in the conversation
But in Polish, it is a mandatory part of a sentence, at least for some
yeah sure
your village would bunga-bunga in one week
I was exactly same as you at exactly the same age
no difference
perhaps Friends instead of TBBT
after less than a year I didn't need the subtitles
after 2-3 good books it went faster
I never stopped reading English books, now I don't know which language was which book
talking is more complex, you need practice
but even here, reading and listening helps a lot
good luck
Rome
I feel cheated I can't go to summer vacations to Italy as planned and this should make up for it, I just replace the sea with Rome sights, restaurants, bookstores
lol courtesy phrases in other languages
I used them in Russia and I was immediately singled out as a tourist and had to pay 10x higher entrance fees
it got much better when I threw money on them and said Two
grabbed the tickets and left
> and got nothing in return
except strengthening of national safety by the US bases
you have a Czech flag
do you live in Poland or why are you speaking up
Poles were the third most active party in Iraq for a reason
commenting only so I can come back when rested and think if there is a hidden analogy with a penis or something else in play here
haha it must have taken a lot of work to find (in the respective native languages) which countries are the most triggered when called Eastern Europe
you seem to have gotten it right
late 90s. it was a year when the Americans left serious doubt about their driving
a jet fighter into your funicular, then some ship, then a.n U-boat resurfaced beneath a japanese fishing ship
CZ: every grocery is a Polish grocery
it is our popular passtime to complain about it
they produce everything, mostly in the exact quality that the shop management ordered
haha that's cute
and funny
but when her mouth and hands are full, she doesn't cause harm
memorials of soldiers who died on your soil are OK in my book
the discussion is more about all those Lenins and Stalins who are clearly devilish people who killed millions, damaged the Russian nation and many surrounding nations
I was born in Czechoslovak Socialist Republic
and when I hear about good old times, yes people were young and their boners solid but you were fine if you didn't object to what bad things were happening around you, weren't religious, your parents had good records and much more (greatparents not landowners, siblings/uncles not ran to the West) so you were permitted to study, didn't mind your income being 10-20%? of the same person behind line (not sure, but if you tried to cross that line, good chance is that you'd be killed)
we're all lucky this forum is for Europeans, otherwise any Chinese would have you all shut up with their "shi shi shi shi shi"...
> Är det det det är
especcialy this one :-) a tractor is starting
or a gay machine gun
but this flows pretty well even today, you immediately get it
"nikdo nezranen" on the other hand
I can't believe this can be used as described above
This sounds like a Saturday night in Czechia
Hello from Prague
&#x200B;
Also I am sure half of these people are French
Also a well-known youtuber started to cut the locks, I hope that this becomes a tradition too
05 here
I read a book on my way to work and back, so no opinion on the darkness/weather, I wear a warm jacket and dream of riding my bike again
s prehnanymi naroky
can't say it in one word either, also not specific to parents, just "entitled"
also - entitled is not what helicopter parents are, I'd say it means micro-managing
how about "stihacka" ? / a fighter jet ... she is behind your back and you have no rest as a child / a partner
Slovakia - sparsely populated forests, 2 -small and short-aged kingdoms, then Hungarian empire, then Austrian-Hungarian empire, then some confusion in the 20th century regarding our cohabitation with Czechs, Can be done in 5 classes :-)
Czech republic: boar stew - with rose hip sauce or with cabbage
(people don't eat it on a regular basis but the question has been made famous in the popular Hrabal/Menzel movie
I think people more discuss if they should have a regular or alcohol-free beer with their lunch
Hezky řečeno
My dad told me that he watched Star Wars in polish ( from Czechoslovakia ) so I guess they were hard to find in CZ
this one should be sainted or a capital renamed after him
and he should have been recognized immediately after war
is there some more complexity
demonstrations
at least
also: how does he like current US regime
he would fare worse if this happened in the US today
I am leaning to demonstrations against his imprisonment, but Wikileaks
this makes me sympathize a tiny bit less
Wow
Troll A - TIL
you got it
the best building in Bratislava
I was born across the street from that church
and went to the school that was built together with the church
I can't find a good photo though, people make shitty photos on internet
the buildings above are shitty, the bridge is a commie horror, built across a historical part and leads cars to the traffic jam in the old town
the radio building is a ruin together with its surroundings
you Bucharest guys spoilt my victory
before you came with your ugly truth I was happy to help OP with Hradec Kralove
Slovakia - Koliba (Studio Koliba) near the dominant hill Koliba with a TV transmitter in Bratislava
stolen in the 90s by the then-PM, an autocratic and stealing SoB and gifted to his daughter
Yea I just saw it in an article about the new James Bond movie
I'd say half bad
Private health insurance probably means that the public one is not that good
Benefits portal where you waste money for things you don't want because you don't like gym and cinema
I send it all to pension funds, so it is kinda like cash but with lot of fuzz
free fruits and drinks is couple tens EUR per year and the coffee is 100% terrible
even paid coffee is 99% terrible
what I am saying is not against Poland
I have almost exactly same benefits as described but I would like to get some money instead
if you like the points, that's good for you, but I don't like cinema, gym, food supplements, strange books and strange package tours
if I couldn't use it for pension funds I would let it fall through
most of my colleages and other people in /r/czech think similarily
tbh I know what I'd like for benefits
everything that saves time
I want a food delivery company to have a drop point at us
I want a post office or a chance to use the receptionists as my post office
a bike path to the office
healthy and quality food at premises, even for money
Everything from the Romantic era
I went to a school with focus on math and we had to turn off the brain for all those personal sufferings, natural disasters, fake history etc
Women eat apples
Moscow is Sagrada Famiglia and Turkey is Manhattan
Good point
I saw a ventilator once and the person was in induced coma so as not to fight the ventilator
He wouldn’t be able to give it up then
Respirator can be a breathing filter + a better mask, or an oxygene supply
Better explanation for both to be found on wikipedia, I just don’t see the coma thing
Maybe a good time for some bike show celebration
The actual Finnish birthday picture you’ve been waiting for
*gold
It is an honor to be on this list
I spent half a year in Slovenia and it felt much more like central Europe than the rest of Balkan
>German influence
German, Austrian, and Italian
Also, the "reason" you mentioned is an argument itself
We are not talking about languages here
I was obviously not talking about languages
Slovenian is, of course, closer to other South Slavic languages
I lived there, and learned the language, so I am very aware of that
I am talking about architecture, culture, etc
For example, Slovenia is much more industrialised than the rest of Balkans
It is a lot wealthier country, the living standard is clearly closer to Austria or Czechia than to Bosnia, Serbia, Montenegro, Romania or Bulgaria
The cities and villages also resemble the Austrian style, far away from what you see in the real Balkans
the difference is striking
Also, my personal observation is that Slovenians look a lot like Austrians, not like Bosnians, Serbians, Montenegrins, Romanians or Bulgarians
And as far as my experience, this is plain to see to anybody who has traveled through this region
He is absolutely right
You narrowed the discussion down to languages, and apparently you think others don't know there are language groups
We are talking about different aspects of the topic though
You missed the point
oPpOrTuNitY, sTaBiLiTy
MEPs which represent the people in the EP are directly elected
Your head of state who represents the UK's national interests in the European Council is indirectly elected
Your ministers who represent the UK's national interests in the Council of the EU are indirectly elected
As for commissioners at the EC (or judges at the ECJ), I haven't heard of any country where people elect technocrats to offices
BTW, those "imaginary numbers" are real money made from the "poor hard working falimiles" who work for those billionares
shut the up prazak
why are you proud of the industry exploiting vulnerable people who are desperate for money
why would you be proud of this
why are you proud of the stereotype of czechs being pornstars
Are you serious
The porn industry is exploiting vulnerable people who need money - and the people upset at the industry are the problem
Whenever any Cechia related stuff on reddit posted, some guy in comments writes YOU BETTER CZECH YOURSELF BEFORE YOU WRECK YOURSELF or some lame check/czech switcheroo
It is just
boring
At least Australians stereotypes is danger noodles + everything is trying to kill you & calling everyone cunt
We have a lame wordplay
From Lapland to Portugal without a single border stop
If you'd tell this to someone 70 years ago, they would laugh at you
We should be celebrating this every day
There were the Polish Armed Forces in the East w/ the Red Army
Although at that time they were a bit further south fighting in Saxony and for Prague
*Russia enemy gang is expanding*
[oh jeez]
o shit waddup
Is it beautiful so the architect can sell the plans to the king more easily or for the birds’  benefit or they had envisioned the planes and drones
Came for this
Thanks a lot
> qwant is the best engine right now
it won't find everything but for 90~95% of your searches, it will be good
As much as I want Qwant to succeed, the search results are absolute trash, even compared to DDG
Another "independent" search engine is Mojeek, also in trash phase currently
For people who are not in the know, this burn actually has additional layer — Slovakian people absolutely hate being called Hungarians (historically Huns occupied and lived on parts of today's Slovakia and Slovaks are still salty about the whole deal and whatnot)
And it is the Czech people who always crack this joke
He is called his mom a Hungarian Ho, so that is like double the points
