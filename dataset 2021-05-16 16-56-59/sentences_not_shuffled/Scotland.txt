The treaty of the union happened because Scottish politicians were bought
The East India Company in England wanted to maintain a monopoly on trade so they forced financial backers to withdraw from the Darien scheme and threatened legal action
When the colony failed the lowlands was left in financial ruin, including the members of the Scottish parliament, who recieved a financial payoff, land and power for helping to pass the act of the union
Finland, because nothing would change
Britain (after Scot Indy though ;) )
What would happen if I said England
Jk i don't have anything against England but Scotland would get more attention that way
UK here, we've already nuked ourselves out of the EU via stupidity
So us
Second choice France, because obviously
Can we take this opportunity to do England while we can
The Netherlands: in a decade they will have fully reclamed the area, and will probably be twice the size and thrice as awesome
England just England not Wales or Scotland just England
England
There used to be
You know
when France and the uk claimed north Africa
Perhaps, Scotland primarily voted to remain if I remember correctly, so then we may get to just say "hey Europe, we didn't want to leave, mainly England, so we're just gonna stay" and the EU would only leave behind a drowned, nationwide Atlantis
Nah, just let the whole thing burn, we're a stupid island
That's exactly the point of that comment
Wholeheartedly disagree on the former there pal
Scotland just became the first country to make tampons free for all that need them
What unique progressive laws does your country have
We haven't done that yet
The bill only passed it's first reading in parliament
Jesus, this is the third time I've had to explain this
Have they actually done it yet
I heard about it a while ago but I didn’t know it had been put in place yet
surely that’s being quite late to the party
The great retreat
Stalinism was a confusing time
In Scotland if a disabled person is hired, if a charity helped them apply for work, the government pays part of the wage
I guess kinda similar
Isn't more that you can't be punished with extra prison time if you escape because of the right to seek freedom
It's similar to once the bill goes for reading in the lords because the committees are weak they almost always pass the laws
But you are right it needs to go for more readings
What type of progressivism do we need then
>So hownis it fair and just to make something free that only 50% of the population need
You could put that towards anything
Imagine 50% of people in a country didn't have clean water
That would matter, wouldn't it
From my understanding it is available upon request, so for example, you ask at a pharmacy for it
What's your problem on helping other people
I worked it out and the law would only cost £9
26 per tax payer
I was told that that is less than what alot of women pay for sanitary products in a month
It's all for a greater cause
It means free **at the point of use**.
Generally this only needs to be explained to Americans
Slovenia's novelty was making privatisation of water unconstitutional
... and we're *well* behind Sweden
so they were the first but also the sixteenth
don’t get me wrong, it’s a great move
Many young girls miss school because of periods
If people miss school, then obviously unemployment rate goes up and overall poverty goes up, meaning more tax actually has to be payed in the long term to help these people
So actually, even for you (I presume your a libertarian), it's cheaper in the long term
It will cost £25 million a year in Scotland
That is only £9
25 per taxpayer per year
I've been told that is less than what alot of women pay in a month for sanitary products
Why do you think girls choose to skip school because of periods
They would really rather not
Actually I didn't, you edited your comment after you posted
I simply didn't see it
Women wouldn't choose to have periods if they could
But unfortunately, it's a natural process
Don't use the equality card here for a natural process
They shouldn't be punished for *being women
Periods decrease equality between genders, and by making tampons free and reducing the impact of periods, it actually closes the inequality gap
It means all young girls can go to school and enjoy life, just like men
Just to remind you it's only for the price of a Domino's pizza
Probably irrelevant, but I am saying this as a man
First of all, men have no such natural process
Women have a pretty hefty process to deal with
So naturally, there is an inequality
Then,
Remember, it's not just the West that exists
Although even if you count the West:
Big time bad fuckin news
I'm with you, OP
Hoping that this is the moment at which the balance tips finally and definitively towards Scottish independence
I fear for the damage he will do in the meantime, but frankly Hunt is just as bad
Rory Stewart being defeated before the final round was a loss to the UK, but perhaps a gain for Scotland
Yeah, um
Fuck
Though this might bring about a general election but honestly I don't think that would really solve anything as I doubt there will be any outright majority and I don't trust Jeremy Corbyn with Brexit either
As another Scot, I'm disappointed that another countryman would use a phrase such as 'low-key happy'
It doesn't mean anything
Low
Key
? What the fuck is that supposed to mean as an adverb or whatever the fuck it is
Also as a Scot I see your point
However I'm worried about the rest of the UK
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK
That sums it up
I support independence, but our closest neighbour setting itself on fire benefits no one
I can see him doing immense damage to vulnerable people throughout the UK before we're through with this shite
Fuck
Hope that’s stupid, fat, Tory bastard crashes and burns and makes the biggest mess he can for the same reasons as u and for Scotland to get their independence
She wasn't handed a shitty hand, she reached and desperately grasped the shitty hand, just so she could get her taste of power
She didn't cry at the Grenfell memorial, she didn't cry for the Windrush generation deported to die far from home in a country they'd never been to before, she didn't cry when it was revealed austerity measures and universal credit failings were literally killing people on our streets
She cried for herself when she finally lost her job though
Fuck her
I'm guessing the Belgian attitude was:
> Is the beer still flowing
Are the frites still frying
Are our football team half-decent
> Yes
Well then, no government, no problem

Well that's really bizzare, definitely didn't expect to learn about this
Also the Darien scheme was a bit of a bruh moment
Louisiana purchase was beneficial to both sides
If France had not sold it it would more than likely have been nicked from
Deep
This sounds rather familiar
Only country that ever lost its independence to an accounting error
I don't drink but uh sure
Quite a large percentage of people in this country live in poverty unfortunately
Poverty in Scotland means living in a shoddy 70s council flat on a sink estate in the central belt, working minimum wage which really isn’t nearly enough, being in debt, having to choose between essentials like food or heating, basically being fucked over by society in ever way, and having very poor health
My dad grew up very poor in the East end of Glasgow and both his parents died before 65, meanwhile my mum, who was raised
in the posh Edinburgh Southside has parents alive and well in their 90s...
Nothing that hasn't been said here already
You live in an ugly 70s flat, your friends probably just drink booze for recreation on your free time, your diet is shit and your parents are probably overweight due to it, etc
You get given £260 minimum every fortnight, and are given subsidies that help pay your rent for accommodation
You can get more for interview clothes, or if you have dependants
You use that money to buy designer clothes, cigarettes, and your favourite football teams latest top which looks suspiciously like their other ones
You then claim the government doesnt give you enough
Remember that documentary type thing ross kemp did with the guy whos toes rotted off
Some council houses and tenements are actually quite nice, believe it or not
Some of the council estates, like the ones in Dundee, were built about 100 years ago specifically to house the working classes, and they are actually alright
And even if you live in a big posh house with a mortgage, you won't escape the depressing effect of the climate
> overty could be not being able to afford quality health care
How does healthcare work in Finland
I'm surprised this is an issue
The UK has many issues with inequality, far worse than anything in Finland, but at least the NHS will never turn away anyone, regardless of their financial situation
Yes you are right
It’s called the ‘Glasgow Effect’. No one knows exactly why it happens but it’s probably just a result of many factors such as poor diet, poverty, high alcoholism, drugs, poor exercising, smoking, etc etc
Sorry what
His toes fell off and he kept them on top of his telly
(extreme world s2 e3)
That clears things up
That's kind of what it's like with the NHS in England (NHS Scotland is better imo)
You can use private insurance if you want to, and many people opt for that
67 is still shocking, but not quite 54
Yes
I couldn’t be happier with my accent
(Unless I was Irish, they’ve also got awesome accents)
No, it's kind of stuck half way between Scottish and Irish with a good bit of English mixed in
I've lived in too many places
I think about half the Spaniards I've met speaking English either have a fairly distinct accent and the other half are pretty much indistinguishable from UK locals
And yeah, accents don't really matter much tbh, there's really no need to alter them if people understand you (which matters far more on the quality of your English than the accent you have)
Given that there is no proper accent for English, basically so long as your English is understandable (and that typically depends more on better grasp of the language than accent unless you are grossly unlucky) it really doesn't matter
Given the spread of native English accents (plethora of UK, Australian, US, South African, Jamaican, etc accents) and accents from immigrant populations (Indian, Pakistani, Caribbean) no one is going to through a wobbly because you sound a bit German
Be a bit sterile and off if everyone spoke in the godawful RP accent
Eh, we have accents and dialects
Even dialling back local dialects (say, very Scots infused Glasweigin or lowland slang), you'll still have a distinct and different accent from say, someone from the North of England, or the South of England, or even the Highlands, all speaking Queen's English but sounding different
You can say all the same words but it'll come out different because your accents will make you pronounce them slightly differently (including stuff like whether your local accent is rhotic or not)
Given there isn't really a singular 'correct' English accent to aspire to and emulate (RP tried to be that, but I think most Northerners and Scots pretty distinctly hate it for sounding fake and unnatural), accents don't much indicate lack of mastery of the language (and indeed, I think the Germans I've met with the worst English tended to be the ones with a plain southern English accent that had clearly been bought at the expense of actual proficiency in the language)
Glasgow - It used to be a city of industry and was at the heart of the Scottish enlightenment
Nowadays it's just full of drug addicts, any of its former glory is long since gone and is now just a crime hub
They try to say that "people make Glasgow" but that's the kind of thing you say when your city is shit
If Towns were included then I'd say Falkirk is slightly worse, but since its Cities
It's probably Edinburgh, all the buildings and architecture are beautiful but it's got a reputation of having no culture
Not a city but a county
Fife, it’s not even really a bad place it’s just the place everyone in Scotland automatically thinks of when they want a place to bully
The think everyone always says about them is that they all have 3 toes and their mum is their sister
Or Edinburgh simply because it’s about 70% English people now and is the least scottish place is Scotland
Only one of these is a city but Scotland doesn’t have a lot of cities, just big towns
Edinburgh, Stevenson, paisley, ardrossan, Saltcoats, Irvine, kilwinning, FIFE, Kilmalcolm, Coatbridge, all of East Kilbride, Livingston and finally fucking port glasgow
Glasgow, Scotland
Full of alcoholism, heavy drug use, violence and homelessness
On top of all that its filthy
The amount of trash just laying around is shocking
I don't see why anyone would spend their money to come here, especially tourists
It's a shitehole
Gelsenkirchen was not an impressive place at all
I stopped in Malmö on the way back from visiting my friend in Lund
I stumbled open a "Scottish" bar - literally the only one I have ever seen outside of Scotland
I didn't know that was a *thing*, I'm just used to it always being Irish pubs
I thought Turku was rather pleasant when I was there, Valkeakoski was much more grim
That's ridiculous
Glasgow is so much more than a city full of drug addicts and a 'crime hub', I don't know how you are even claiming such a thing
There are bad parts sure but it's still a fantastic city to live in with much to see and do
Spoken like a true Edinburgh wanker
Glasgow cant be fixed no matter what they do, Aberdeen is boring I'll grant you but at least its safe and isnt dirty
I've only been to Paisley once, the centre seems alright but cant vouch for the rest
I have the misfortune of living rather near Falkirk so we have to see it ruining our views down the Forth Valley
We're each entitled to pur own opinions
I just find Glasgow drab, dirty, and full of undesirable people
Even the nightlife is pretty grim
I'm not saying its devoid of hope, but it's not somewhere I would recommend to someone visiting
I'm not from Edinburgh
Good
I dont want you to hate it
I'm glad you liked it
I'm not trying to dissuade anyone, just giving my personal opinion
I feel Scotland has alot to offer foreign visitors, but just personally dont think Glasgow shows our country in the best light
Alot of them put on an accent that isnt even remotely Scottish too, they think it makes them endearing but it's just really annoying
Apologies I didnt see the other comment, I found it interesting that Finland has lots of nice smaller towns and cities, maybe not scarred by immense industrialisation
Put on
Not remotely Scottish
Mate you need to expand on this because this is definitely a lot of shite
I have no trouble believing that, theres a reason the locals call it Mordor
When Glaswegians speak normally versus when they speak for an audience is completely different
Used to be "got stuck behind a tractor" when I lived in a more rural area, now that I live in Glasgow "trains were late/scotrail was as on time as ever" usually works a treat as our train system is late, always
A 5 minute delay minimum is pretty much standard
That’s why I prefer to bike to work
The really bad customer service thats screaming at englang for no apparent reason
Technically, none now

We started the company but left to go travelling
In most British accents "can't" sounds like "cahnt", "caant" or even "carnt" (with a soft 'r')
In most American accents it sounds like "cannt", or even "caint".
Brexit, this will probably change in the future but there's been surprisingly little discussion on whether we ought to ask for another extension after this is over

Wealthy Pro-ScotGov individuals can travel to their second homes whenever it suits them and it's no bother
The concept of league titles and fair competition in football has been rendered meaningless
Might not seem important right now but honestly its the thing that has me the most stressed
And before anyone says;
Football does fucking matter, to a great many people
No Im not a Rangers fan
What's happening with it
I've not been keeping up with the football
So there was meant to be another 8 games left in the season, but due to Covid they won't be played
Three facts are important here; Celtic didn't yet have enough points to win, Dundee Utd never had enough points to win the championship, and Hearts and Partick thistle both had more than enough of a chance to avoid relegation
All that being as it is, Dundee Utd have been given a league title they never won, and Partick have been relegated
In the coming days Celtic will be given a title they never won, and Hearts will be relegated
To me, the fact that Cetic and Dundee were "probably going to win" is irrelevant
As is the fact that Hearts etc were "probably going down". We might as well just give Celtic all the league titles for the rest of time and never play another game of football again
No reasonable person could possibly think this is fair, and all the clubs who voted for it are selfish bastards
Is that a challenge
Alba or Caledonia
Alba is the Gaelic word for Scotland, and I don’t know exactly how old it is but a brief skim of Wikipedia says it was in use around 1100 years ago
Caledonia was the Latin word for Scotland, and is still used as a kind of poetic name for the country
Dugald seems to have fallen out of fashion
Morag, or Eric
Fergus
It's a good name but it'll always make me think of some old, hairy, kilted highlander who spends too much time with his sheep
Dinnae bump into too many Angus's but
Fucking loved when we had an English teacher in who couldn’t pronounce the Irish and the Gaelic names
Especially when they badly mispronounced them
‘Is Raisin in today
‘It’s Roisin miss
Although maybe not as fun to have your name misspronounced all the time as just to watch from the sidelines but
Caledonia is such a beautiful word
A had a PE teacher called Angus when I was at School; only angus av ever encountered
Eamonn and Eireann are easy as fuck but what the fuck is Radharc
Yeah, that happens to me sometimes when I’m immersed in my Japanese
This is what it's like to hear a Scottish accent in a film
Scotland has three officially recognized languages: English, Scots and Scottish Gaelic
Scotland includes over 700 islands
Our national animal is a Unicorn
We have the highest proportion of redheads in the world
We invented golf
I'm gonna do Scotland because everyone knows about the UK
We have 3 languages
We managed to fight off the Romans
In the dark ages, we were basically a battle ground between the Gaels, the Picts, the Brythonic people, the English and the Norse
It is illegal to ride a cow whilst drunk in Scotland
We are currently colonised by W\*nkers (movie reference please don't get mad)
Albania also takes the most cocaine second one to Scotland
Yeah, English, Scots, Scottish Gaelic
(I can speak all of them)
Videogames are for kids
For some reason, a lot of people in my city tend to know little or none about videogames, my parents and many others in my city still call them 'computer games' like back in the 80's. I think it's because parents really only tend to see their kids playing videogames and never see anybody else beside their kids friends playing them, so they think games are like toys for kids just how Action Man or Barbie is
So when they see an adult on a bus with a Switch, it's like they seem them as a manchild
Don't get me started
I saw one that said that Scottish Independence supporters are anglophobic (hating of English people)
I have no problem with English people (that would be racism if I did) but it's the political system I hate
That our problems were caused by the EU and immigrants, not by shitty British governments that only cared about London and the top 10%.
Go to Glasgow and it's a crapfest, Politicians don't care about anywhere outside London
I love immigrants also btw, they deserve a chance to build a career and live here in Scotland
Immigrants aren't to blame for the decline of this country, it's those stupid politicians that don't care about the rest of the UK at all
My Doric is extremely rusty, so I’d love if somebody who still knows it and speaks it could answer this
This is my favourite one, the cadence is very tolkienesque
Yes, but it's unlikely to happen, there's too much money at stake
Also, the thought of wearing a kilt in the Gulf heat is nightmarish
But it's probably all moot - I don't think Scotland will qualify
Scotland is one step ahead on this, we probably won't even qualify just to be sure
Yeah I mean Scotland has been boycotting world cups for ages now
Qatar shouldn’t even have been able to bribe the judges in order to get the World Cup
No country should be allowing a country with their human rights records or working conditions to be allowed to participate on the world stage in this manner
John Mason (who is an idiot and needs deselection for the 2021 Scottish elections) questioned whether Skye was a real island because it had a bridge
That was like the Premier League's thing prior to the shutdown:
*The players must not shake hands prior to the game*
Players then proceed to shake hands and hug during a goal celebrations and at the end of the game
Ah, him
His latest effort has been to ask questions in Westminster about the mechanism for ending the SPFL season
Quite why this should matter to a Northern Irish MP, or why he should raise it in Westminster when culture and sport are devolved matters, is beyond me
Still, it's good to know that nothing more pressing is happening in the world right now

Catherine Calderwood, Scotland's Chief Medical Officer, so senior civil servant, rather than politician
Which makes it worse, as she was the one advising the government about lockdown
Maybe our CMO was just better at coming up with excuses
I mean, who needs to check on a house twice in one week
Everyone sobering up
Well you could attach some phones to a RC toy car, and build a straw man on top to protest with out you leaving the house
However you kinda have a mobile badly equipt army around french parliament so you risk become leader of France like every other time that's happened
Banning monarchy and becoming emperor is the one you have to top
> I mean, what are people supposed to do when not of wörkings
Well, given that people are panic buying toilet paper *and* my internet connection has slowed down massively today
I can take a pretty good guess
Aye, because they all have Three Stooges Syndrome like Mr Burns from The Simpsons
Well if the uk lost a third war with Iceland I think we'd neither be United or a Kingdom
Unless Holyrood becomes the only recognised competent government with northern Ireland deciding being part of greater Scotland is better than its other options
um, not really
It stands out more than other European countries for me, because its a relatively large island which sticks out
I'm disappointed no Icelandic people have said "yes" yet
So you go for your country's first then
Yeah ads for charities like water aid, and save the children
The ads do exist, though they aren't quite as frequent now as they perhaps once were
I wouldn't put them to blame as the reason for the widespread ignorance and misunderstandings regarding Africa, which probably lie in more deeply rooted cultural creations that have existed for at least a few centuries
Achebe's writing are pretty good on the whole debacle, usually using Conrad as an example of the propogandising of Africa to serve European imperialism and other ideologies (Said's Orientalism, using caricatures of non-European states and cultures to define and reinforce the self comes to mind as well)
Such a history of systemic and purposefully misinformation regardint Africa and Africans, plus a general apathy and ignorance to the continent in the present gives rise to the painful beliefs some have of the continent
Systemic propogandistion of the African other and the so called 'Dark Continent' so as to justify European slavery and colonisation likely did not help
Chinua Achebe and Edward Said would suggest this is something purposefully constructed a long time ago, and we see at present the unfortunate echoes of the past in how Africa is portrayed, influenced further by contemporary interests (spectacle in news hardly helps, where tragedy and suffering in Africa becomes all that is shown in many foreign news reporting, as that is what sparks interest in the viewers)
I’m a native English speaker but was very amused to learn the West Scottish word thunderplumps ie ‘it looks like thunderplumps later on’, meaning a heavy shower of rain is due

Well Sheumais (Pronounced Hamish) is just the lenited version of Seumas, so your name is still Seumas but you would say ‘Madainn mhath, a Sheumais’ (Good Morning, Seumas ) when speaking to Seumas

Saddly it is
My dad is very much a british nationalist, british for the british, fuck foreignors, kick everyone out except the whites - you get the idea
He goes on holiday abroad every year, to places like cyprus, turkey, greece, etc
He gets very annoyed when theres germans where he goes (you know
to holiday resort complexes
where everyone is allowed
) he always grumbles about them
He used to live there and speaks a little German so its really suprising to me that he still hates them so much
Bonus: he also thinks the Germans are still trying to take over the world but have learnt from previous tries, as in the world wars, that they cant do it by force
He thinks theyre slowly trying to taking over everything, making themselves the leaders of the EU to get into higher power then make themselves the leaders of europe than slowly evolve their piwer until they control everything
One example I remember clearly him using is while imitating the germans talking about how they were slowly taking over the wolrd he said: "lets create a universal language that everyone from all countries will learn to communicate and call it German". Like dad
we did that
English
Did you forget that
What the hell
Yeah my dad is a crazy bigot
Used to value him so much, lost all respect for him
Dont consider him my dad at all anymore
I love all people though
I dont think its fair to hold people from a country against what their country did years and years ago, most likely before they were even born
I dont want anyone to hold how England basically invaded everywhere and stole everyones stuff etc, so Im not gonna hold stuff a country did over someone who had no say in the matter at all (unless they agree with the bad things the country did, then its fuck them)
I can't say anything definitively
But I have heard some anti-German rhetoric with people who identify more with the UK, mainly football hooligans, who go on about the war and have to insert it into anything Germany-related
I was with extended family once, someone mentioned they were going on holiday to Germany and someone had to say "we won the war".
Most people don't have a strong opinion either way I feel
Kinda but also not at all
Some older people are less than fond of Germany and Germans in general, but anyone younger than 70 seems to have a pretty neutral to good opinion of Germans, unless they’re just xenophobic and don’t like any foreigners
I’d go so far as to suggest that Germany is probably one of the most well liked countries among the Scottish public
Non-existent in Scotland
In fact, people in Scotland are probably Germanphiles
Very little
Some older people I know don't trust them
I thought they where fine when I visited
Lol it's the same situation in England and Ireland
A quarter of England's population has Irish ancestry, and cities like Liverpool have probably 50%+ Irish descendant populations, but the two countries are still considered "enemies" because that's just how humans work I guess
That's rather ironic
The Swiss are stereotyped as being the Germans on steroids sometimes, "even more humour-less, harder workers, more anal about order and laws, etc
Because it was West Germany that England beat in the World Cup final in 1966
Yessir
Hope things look up dude
God bless
Tim Horton's is headquatered in Canada but mostly owned from Brazil
Rockstar North
Rockstar North Limited (formerly DMA Design Limited) is a British video game development company and a studio of Rockstar Games based in Edinburgh
... In 1997, DMA released Grand Theft Auto, which was a huge success; the game sparked a successful series
I thought it was primarily developed by Rockstar North, which was founded in Dundee and is now based in Edinburgh
Swindon
I spat my pepsi out reading that lol

Of course not but I could *never* imagine switching to the US system

Universal healthcare is amazing
October 2018 I ended up in the a&e at 1am with suspected water intoxication after I drank 10 pints of lime and soda way too quickly
I was seen in a&e right away and was admitted into the hospital at 4am when a bed freed up in the amu with the staff dropping by to make sure I was ok
I had diluted my blood so much that my sodium levels were dangerously low
I was released at 1pm that day after sleeping and my sodium levels returned to normal
My stupidity only cost me taxi fair to and from the hospital
Part of it was also that in the democratic countries, old parties had again been somewhat discredited and voters wanted change
The Liberal party died in the UK pretty much due to WWI, and WWII made parts of the British population want something different from continued Toryism
A total war inherently shakes up the political space, because it is some impactful and invasive to daily life
Scottish tap water became a bit of a meme earlier this year, it's pretty good
It does vary a bit from area to area, I find that Edinburgh's water isn't as nice as my own town's. For some reason my MiL only drinks the bottled stuff though
The tap water here is so good (at least in rural areas) that it is basically the same stuff they sell in bottles as luxury-branded 'Scottish mineral water'. If you are in the cities it's not as good, but still perfectly safe and good to drink - and most people do
it varies a lot over the UK - south and east tend to be hard water areas with poor tasting tapwater - Scotland and the North West of England are soft water with mostly decent tapwater
that's fair, it can be strong in places
How does that compare with NL
Do you guys chlorinate less
I get this weird enjoyment out of finding etymological similarities in words from different languages, and seeing the word “frekwencja” got me all giddy because it made me realise it’s like “frequency” in English, which is used similarly in so many other languages too
I - a native English speaker - have the same problem in Arabic
I can use Arabic fairly fluently to discuss summit meetings, peace talks, constitutional reforms, weapons of mass destruction, terrorist attacks and landmines
That's the professional language I've had to use in my work
But I'm stuck on the names of common vegetables, or how to ask for more pillows in a hotel
Calling people English
Calling them British, while factually correct and OK to some, is also a bit risky
As a Scottish person yeah this is true, don't

DEUX BAGUETTES
Shopkeeper: Bonjour Monsieur
Tourist: Bonjour Monsieur
Shopkeeper: See, it is not hard to be polite here in my shop
Two baguettes coming up
I’m gonna add a few:
Don’t call us Irish either
It is substantially better than calling us English, but it’s still annoying
Scottish culture has historically been mocked quite extensively in pop culture, so don’t do that
There’s a fair chance people will just take it as a joke and have a laugh, but it’s probably not worth the risk
Don’t try a Scottish accent
An awful lot of people, particularly Americans, seem to think they can pull it off
They can’t. It’s very annoying
Also, if you are planning on visiting the UK, particularly England, then I’m gonna offer you some advice and say don’t bring up the Empire
It probably won’t piss anyone off, but you’ve got like a 50/50 chance of running into one of those “Britannia rules the waves” people, and it’s honestly better to just save yourself the headache
This really gets me
I prefer being called Scottish, but I don't mind being called British (It's what I technically am)
Being called English though is just plain wrong and ignorant
It's the exact same as like calling a French person German
This has always confused me a bit
Like, I can understand why someone might get languages like Norwegian and Swedish confused with one another cause they sound similar, but you only have to listen to a five second clip of Portuguese to realise that Portuguese and Spanish are COMPLETELY different languages
I'm afraid that the most common term for Dutch people in some languages is "Hollander" (in Portuguese, "holandês"), so the confusion is pretty entrenched
This is the second time I’ve seen an Icelandic person on this thread talk about off road driving
Is it a common problem in Iceland
Lmao I’ve got a Ukrainian friend here in Scotland
Nothing, and I mean NOTHING pisses him off more than people calling him Russian
So naturally, we call him Russian at every opportunity
Guilty
To be fair, it does taste better (ducks for cover)
Well, that's just a lazy insult, I'm incredibly disappointed that this is the best he could come up with
That there
is fightin' talk :D
Cornwall is the only place I've heard someone stop themselves and deliberately refer to a black person as a "negro" because it *less* offensive than the word they'd partially said
If it makes you feel better about Cornwall, the current champion of their traditional annual street-brawl-turned-sport is the son of an Italian immigrant
>Dating back to before the 16th century, "Hurling the Silver Ball" is considered to be the county's official sport (alongside Cornish wrestling) and involves the Townsmen and Countrymen engaging in what's probably best described as a lawless game of street rugby
The objective is to place a specially made silver ball in one of the goals set two miles apart at opposing ends of the town
But as I'd garnered from a couple of pretty violent stories, it's never that simple
>Townsman Marco Ciarleglio, the 22-year-old son of a half-Italian fish and chip shop owner, was the reigning champion—the winner of the previous three events, in fact—and in no mood to relinquish his crown
As tradition dictates, he had "called up" hurling veteran and the 1977 titleholder Philip Tremain to do the honors
Being the champ is a big deal in these parts
I'm sorry to hear that mate, and genuinely surprised - but then again, I've never been to Cornwall so I wouldn't know how bad the racism is down there
> No one will get genuinely angry with you
That depends a lot on the Scot in question and how drunk they are at the time
But by and large, no, they wouldn't get pissed off unless you were being deliberately annoying
At this point I'm pretty sure nobody will see this but:
\-Tbh I'd react the same way if you called me Irish as if you called me Russian - it's simply not true
\-Yes
Especially yelling "Freedom
\-Yes
\-Yes, especially if you actually know the history of it all
"mate". It's just easier that way
(In general it's better to use the individual nation rather than British, but most people will let the wrong term slide or offer a polite correction - as it's obvious that's being done by mistake, rather than as a wind-up)
"People of the British isles" is the only way I can really think of since the BI include Ireland and you do NOT call them British
One thing I've come to appreciate over the years is beer with foam
I mean I love my ketchup as much as the next ketchup addicted person
But I would never, never, ever, ever put it on any pasta dish
That is pretty much a cardinal sin
It’s the generations of inbreeding
> "Ostküsten-Eliten" (east coast financial elites),
I don't think that's a dogwhistle for Jews
A lot of people in the US hate the old school Anglo-Saxon, Protestant politicians like George Bush Senior, and they're the epitome of "east coast elite".
Hating on the mainstream media isn't really a Nazi exclusive thing either
American Socialists and Communists have never trusted the New York Times, CNN, etc
If anything, a few years ago, distrusting the mainstream media was the Left's thing, since they always accused it of being a tool of the American government
Now listen here you little shit
I don't
Calling it a mess is the biggest understatement this century ahahaha
Ok since it's you I'll give it a go
Not all Welsh teams
And there is also 1 English team playing in Scotland
I read somewhere we are 2nd in the developed world for obesity so we've got to do much better to beat America
So according to that graph Scotland doesn't exist
Am I even real
r/antinatalism would be proud
Keep it up Portugal
More like 52% amirite
You guys have ads for tobacco products
Too right, the world needs less humans (and not through violent means)
350,000,000 is just a magic number

My German husband tends to roll his eyes when i (british/australian) counter his arguments for german superiority with "yer, but scoreboard"....
Do you really think the average English person knows nothing of the troubles
That's a bit of a strange assumption to make
We don't have a particularly strong opinion of him in either direction in Scotland
Not sure I'd say our head of state is particularly epic considering she's an inbred German living off the work of millions
Also drinking cultures
Scotland and Northern Ireland perform quite badly compared to England and Wales, largely due to this iirc
Probably influenced somewhat by the other factors you mentioned, but it definitely causes more strain on our systems, and I'd be surprised if this divide in the UK didn't play out betwren northern European countries and the south
We had a prank day which was our last day before exams, but teachers got really good at shutting it down after a kid was tied to a tree for around 3 hours
Our school had a massive staircase up to the dining hall, which had the later addition of a very sturdy bannister, as some enterprising 6th formers had manhandled a teacher's mini up there some years ago
We just superglued cds everywhere and catapulted water bombs into the school at random from the field outside
Did yous call it muck up day
I’m not sure if that was specific to my school or if it was across scotland
A first year got kidnapped by sixth years in a nearby school so their last day stuff got shut down, ours was shut down shortly after simply because the head teacher got fed up of the mess
6ths years 2 years ahead of me were pretty fucked up and hung a mannequin from a noose in a pretty hidden area, teacher spotted it and had a panic attack and called 999
Yeah muck up day was cancelled at least until I left
Wow, the south really *is* that uptight
Seriously like, chill oot lads and hae some fun
We did it in Scotland, the last day of lessons before exams
Our year had a massive waterfight through the school, one of the years above me had a whipped cream fight and the school stank for a week
We called it muck-up day
We called it muck up day as well, or just "last day"
Nah we called it prank day
I don't know anything about the landuage thing but I think the bows were supposed to have non metal heads so he couldn't use his ferrokinesis on them
Haven't heard much Gaelic in movies but I'd imagine it's not very good considering there's not many native speakers left
Scots in movies 99% always seems to be modern English in a bad Scottish accent with a couple of Scots words chucked in
Which would be fine if they were going for modern Scots, or used the Scots words properly
The dwarves from the Witcher 3 stand out in the right idea but nae clue category "I have them dinnae I not
(Scottish English or Scots)
My personal gripe is to do with SO MANY films and television shows casting Americans as Scottish people
The stereotypes, the bad accents, the use of Americanised slang and vocabulary in said bad Scottish accent are so jarring to the point of bbeing obnoxious and insulting
Like seriously, there are plenty of Scottish people about, even for voice acting roles
There are over 5 million of us - you could absolutely find one
Hell, I'm sure you could even find people willing to do it for free just to make the "OHH HIGHLUNDURRR GRR" nonsense stop
And it needs to stop
Immediately
Edward Richtofen is my favourite fake German
Aye thats Gàidhlig had a look there
It's not great but you can tell they've worked at it
Depends how busy, mountains like Ben Nevis have a constant stream of people you would be saying Hi every 20 secs
Yes
Often accompanied with a quip about the weather, or how the other person is looking fitter/faster/younger than you
it's not usually hi or hello here, it's more 'yalright'
On any country road really
I don't live in a particularly mountainous bit of Scotland
Yes
A very brief conversation about the weather or the route might also be acceptable
Nah they smell of sweat and spilled beer ever since the smoking ban
That's exactly what I do as well
To make matters worse for me, Lynx (Axe) body spray gives me very bad headaches, especially Africa
This gentleman in the loo, try to spray Lynx's Africa on me as I enter the loo
"Free sample" he called it
That was the end of my night
He certainly didn't get a tip from me

A very Merry Christmas to all who celebrate it and happy holidays and New Year to all
A dutch cap was a vaginal diaphragm too for a while
There's a story of my grandmother asking a clothes shopkeeper for "a dutch cap" with my mother and aunt and they were cringing and humiliated because said grandmother didn't know that it had that secondary meaning
And dutch cap, a ~~vaginal~~cervical  diaphragm
It now happens to be every single day
I'm an American by birth, emigrated to London in 2006
Lived until March in the Home Counties - just north of London
Post Covid we moved to Scotland
Wonderful place, wonderful people . . . BUT . . . I know technically they are speaking English
But for a certain set (usually 65 years or older) . . .god help me understand a single word
Living in england is this everyday
The amount of regional accents on one small island is a ridiculous amount
Im from the South West and trying to have a conversation from someone up North is very difficult sometimes, especially the likes of accents like the yorkshire accent, the scouse accent, its not up north but to some extent even the London accent is hard to understand
There are a lot of different London accents but theres one particularly (known as "the roadman accent") thats quite hard to understand, the language accent developed its accent with inspiration from african and jamaican roots, the langauge itself is filled with a lot of slang terms that arent widely used outside of the area where its spoken, so while theyre talking english a lot of the words they use will be completely new to you and like a whole new language
Overhearing a conversation in English at Changi airport between a Chinese Singaporean and a Malay Singaporean
It took me a while to realise that it really was English
It wasn't just the 'accent'; the intonation and rhythm of the England threw me off
Also, a conversation between a Tuvaluan and a Solomon Islander
Tenner says he's fae the Cotswolds or Oxford, sorry mate we'll speak "The Queen's English" for you from now on
/s but only for the last part
Scottish here, we don't get the Fife accent either
Fairly understandable with Hamilton
ML postcode accents are eh
tricky
Fucking hell, the diversity of London and
Well I can tell as a child you were not cool like me
I wanted to be a train driver, trains were cool
I had a train set too
Ok maybe you were a cool kid, I mean only cool kids had train sets right
Yes, although some will say "asshole" due to Americanisation from US media
That is very cool
We are not:

* A tribal society
* A drug fueled war zone
* England
American lady who thought Scotland was in England and England was in London
Scottish people dont hate the english - we hate being CALLED english
That we all wear kilts in the daily, and speak in stereotypical heavy accents
Honestly man
Onion
That is all
Which one's the president this year
I do think though that a lot of these ideologies are quite difficult to place on a conventional left - right spectrum
It's kind of like saying "feudalism is right wing", it's a complete anachronism in modern politics, it's its own thing
Tbf you were ruled by Spain from 1580 to 1640, so 1640 would be a reasonable response to when you got independent from Spain
I mean they kind of are but not in the way Americans think there are, there are parts of this country police typically wont go into but they're more in places like Derry
Your username is not helping that misconception
If it's not St Emillion or Châteauneuf du Pape he's an imposter
To be fair some Texans might actually do that
I've heard of it happening relatively recently (like 1990s) in Scotland because the roads were too bad for cars and and bits of Texas are way more rugged than Scotland
Fake *gnus
Probably because the French surrender in world war two really fucked over the UK
It was kind of a big deal that we had to fend of the Nazis basically by ourselves for a year
In many ways it's the most significant thing the French did in living memory that impacted the UK
Eh we're not meme level just depressing level
>British can be referred to collectively as the anglo-saxons
Oi bugger off swamp saxon
Did you have this conversation in English
That may have confused matters a bit
Anti vaxxers are attention seekers who risk the safety of everyone else so they can pretend to be smart
I support mandatory vaccination
I think the bodily autonomy of morons is still important and don't think vaccines should be mandatory at least until that's the last option
There's a level of unvaccinated people that society can cope with an maintain heard immunity
I think once that drops bellow a set level monetary incentives should be offered for vaccination, failing that harder but still soft methods should be used like requiring all children at school to be vaccinated or else not be able to attend school and finally start legally requiring people to have vaccines or face some type of consequence
Anti vaxxers are fuckin morons
Controversial I know
A tag team of someone with downs syndrome great at noticing stuff paired an autistic person who knows everything but wouldn't notice his head falling off unless pointed out to them would make a great feel good movie
I think it’s some old fashioned American term
I haven't seen anything about this but I really hope that it means things can change for you guys
There is so much potential for Kazakhstan, wishing you the best
If I had a Kazakh flag I'd put it up for you guys
It's one of my favourite flags too, nice colours
The thing about Ibiza is, if you go outside of San Antonio or Playa Den Bossa, there really is a different type of tourist
Places like Santa Eularia, Es Canar and other towns are really nice places that attract families and older couples
> they only come for the natural resources
More like they only come for the ecstasy and cocaine
Plenty of Brits treat Prague as a cheap stag/hen do location and don't really care about seeing anything other than the bars with beers for £1 or less (or those cycle bar things) when they go
Personally I think they're missing out
It's probably one of my favourite places I've visited
Hot yesterday but mild today
Just a bit humid but not too bad
I get people think it's too hot but personally i'm grateful for any sun
It's been really warm recently for our standards but I've not really noticed it that bad since I'm not really going out much
When I get in the car though, it's sometimes so warm that you can actually feel the warmth entering your body when you breathe
Today's made up for it though with a fair bit of rain and thunder and lightning
People who live in overseas European territories - how much of a connection would you say you feel to the country you're (technically) part of and is that reflected in your territory's overall society and culture
Sorry for the long question, hope this counts as Europe
Not OP but from Scotland, currently there is nothing to distinguish Scots, Welsh or Northern Irish citizens from English ones on the passport
Feeling of nationality is split between older generations/religion and which country you are originally from in the UK
People in England tend to feel "more British" than Scots
Hey,
So firstly thanks for the detailed answer
Anyways, we have UK nationality with our passport looking exactly the same as that of an English person, nothing complicated there
As for how much of a connection we feel to the UK, it can vary; it looks like most Scots still want to remain in the UK but you don't see many that identify as "British" first (outside Rangers supporters - will explain if asked)
In fact, calling most of us "British" is a no-no, though we'll go easy on you if you're from abroad and just explain that rather than stabbing you
Usually,
As for a connection to England, well it's definitely stronger with the north than with London and anywhere further south
Since the accents are different, the culture more cosmopolitan and the population much more densely packed, I genuinely feel like I'm in a different country once I get there
So really, while we both love beer and football, the only connection most of us feel is a political one, that we're part of the same sovereign state (and usually England gets its way since it has far more people than we do)
I crossposted to the Curacao sub, as for the French Guiana one it only has 26 members so we might be scuppered there
Scots are born with a bottle of whisky in their hand, and a fag in the other
Not part of the question but I'll answer
Personally I am purely Scottish, I never call myself British because I rarely ever feel culturally connected to the complete opposite of me in say Kent
But in Scotland I am an Islander/Highlander/Teuchter
While I grew up a few years in Glasgow I've never considered myself a Lowlander, since the family I had most investment in was Hebridean, I lived in the Hebrides, and my other side of the family are South African/Ulster
My flatmate though, is a stonch British nationalist
He is British first, never calls himself ¿Ayrshire-ish
, but will call himself Scottish when outside of Europe like the USA
Is this because Switzerland itself isn't one country
Its multiple countries with multiple Presidents that band together for international reasons
Or am I just mistaken
The overlapping and interlacing identities are very interesting
I'd identify primarily as Scottish and European, but also as British
(Having a British aspect to my identity doesn't stop me from wanting Scottish independence
I am a great Anglophile in many ways, but that doesn't mean I want to be ruled from London
There's many different reasons people want the union or independence
I've known people proud to be Scottish that would prefer to be ruled by London
Exactly
It's sometimes portrayed that if you 'feel Scottish' you want independence and if you 'feel British' you want the Union, but - although that's the general pattern - there are many exceptions and nuances
What's it called
Cumbernauld
A new town built in the 60s out of concrete and straight lines, it's won awards for its ugliness on multiple occasions
In Scotland, any of the new towns that were built in the 60s and 70s! And many others in the central belt
Glasgow is beautiful in part and a complete dump in other parts
East Kilbride, Cumbernauld (a famous one), Greenock, Airdrie, Glenrothes, Kirkcaldy, Fort William (in a beautiful location but the town centre really sucks), the list could go on
The UK really does have the worst urban design in Europe I would argue
At least they gave us Irn Bru
Haha beat me to it
I would have gone for Dundee, but really it's impossible to argue against Cumbernauld
Originally brewed and in Falkirk however
Yes it’s really terrible
It has such lost potential
Big ugly dual carriageway and roundabouts completely cutting off the high street from the water
Madness
Although it would be expensive, I think they should tunnel the A82 (or at least reduce it to 2 lanes and slow speed to 30) and then build a new street or park along the waterfront
Would do the town enormous good
Part of it could be we are much more conformist: we don't have the same individualistic streak Americans do
Shame and public disapproval can be very effective
In the UK we had a thing where mums were dropping their kids off at school, or going to the supermarket in their jammies
Schools sent home letters saying it was unacceptable, supermarkets made statements and the papers ran it for a while
It's been years since I saw someone in Tesco in their PJs, used to be a weekly occurrence
In America I'd imagine that kind of disapproval would be net with "this is 'murica" and they'd keep doing it because individualism is a far bigger thing there
So your crazies don't get shamed into keeping their crazy locked up while in public
From the school POV it was about appropriateness
They're trying to teach kids about wearing uniform and looking smart coming to school; seeing parents standing at the school gates in PJs and slippers undermined that
The supermarkets went down the same route as restaurants; you must be dressed appropriately to enter
It didn't really hurt anyone but it's about the image these companies wanted to display
None of them wanted to get their own version of r/peopleofwalmart following
\*whatever you want depending on the day and whoever is "reading"\*
We don't really have a constitution but we have a couple of acts that define Scotland's government and relationship with England
&#x200B;
Act of Union 1707:
&#x200B;
Article 1:
That the two Kingdoms of England and Scotland shall upon the First day of May which shall be in the year One thousand seven hundred and seven and for ever after be united into one Kingdom by the name of Great Britain And that the Ensigns Armorial of the said United Kingdom be such as Her Majesty shall appoint and the Crosses of St
George and St
Andrew be conjoyned in such manner as Her Majesty shall think fit and used in all Flags Banners Standards and Ensigns both at Sea and Land
&#x200B;
Scotland Act 1998
&#x200B;
Article 1:
(1)There shall be a Scottish Parliament
(2)One member of the Parliament shall be returned for each constituency (under the simple majority system) at an election held in the constituency
(3)Members of the Parliament for each region shall be returned at a general election under the additional member system of proportional representation provided for in this Part and vacancies among such members shall be filled in accordance with this Part
(4)The validity of any proceedings of the Parliament is not affected by any vacancy in its membership
(5)Schedule 1 (which makes provision for the constituencies and regions for the purposes of this Act and the number of regional members) shall have effect
&#x200B;
Scotland act 2016:
&#x200B;
(1)The Scottish Parliament and the Scottish Government are a permanent part of the United Kingdom’s constitutional arrangements
(2)The purpose of this section is, with due regard to the other provisions of this Act, to signify the commitment of the Parliament and Government of the United Kingdom to the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish Government
(3)In view of that commitment it is declared that the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish Government are not to be abolished except on the basis of a decision of the people of Scotland voting in a referendum

The Darien Scheme in the 1690s. It was a last ditch attempt to build up a colony in what is now Panama, before Scotland was left in the dust in the colonisation game
We literally threw every bit of coin we had at it to make sure it would be successful
We got there, the climate and conditions killed off over half the crew
Then, the Spanish show up and start attacking due to it being their claimed land (go figure)
Then, England starts sabotaging it to make it fail by setting up blockades
It went on from about 1695-1700 before it was given up on
It would have maybe went a little better if there was any solid planning on our side
It was unrealistic to think it'd ever work
That lead to Scotland going bankrupt
In 1707, England offered to pay of Scotland's debt if all power was given to London
And that lead to the kingdom of Great Britain
It's a small event that sets up something a bit bigger I would say
The fact that a Rolls Royce factory in East Kilbride, Scotland, refused to make parts for the Pinochet regime in Chile and grounded the entire Chilean airforce at the time
All i remember about it is that it was one of a number of pre reformation reformation movements similar to the Lollards in England
Basically the moderates worked with the HRE emperor and the radicals were outcast
Just to note, there was very little of Scotland's money spent on Darien
Most of the money had come from private subscriptions, so it was the merchant class that was bankrupt
The Scottish state was running a surplus, and access to Scotland's national cash reserves were one of England's key motivations for promoting the Acts of Union
I think that time period became a lot better known outside Germany thanks to the popularity of the Baader-Meinhof Complex film; I remember it being pretty well received at the time

Edinburgh has pretty decent cycle network
All the old railways around town have been converted into nice wide paths for bikes and pedestrians
Most places in the city are accessible fairly easily by these, and they crisscross enough that the network is versatile too
As a result cycling on roads feels wrong to me
Like I'm breaking some kind of social norm
I’ve heard quite a few people from the North East of Scotland do this too except they inhale as they say ‘aye’.
Quite a few words in Scots are similar to Scandinavian languages: bairn/barn, hus/hoose, bra/braw, flytta/flit, gåta/greet, dykke/dook, etc
French does that same thing with ‘si’.
I believe it’s got a lot to with the vowels having not shifted in Scots
So hoose instead of house
When I lived in Belgium I found there were a lot of common words/sounds between Scots English and Flemish
Ken meaning know for example
Maybe an unpopular opinion but I think the current system is fine
People are talking about the benefits of winter/summer time in this thread, but you get the benefits of both year-round by switching twice a year, and having one hour less of sleep on one night is worth the countless hours of extra sunlight in the day imo
Ideally keeping winter time year round
We're too far north and west so the extra light in the mornings would be more beneficial for people walking to school
If I have to pick then I'd say keep winter
In winter here if you kept summer time we wouldn't have even twilight until 9am, the sun wouldn't be up until closer to 10am
And the sun would still set before 5pm so you're not getting any benefit from it at the other end of the day
In summer if you don't bring the clocks forward you've still got civil twilight until the back of 10 at night which is sufficient for most people
But the better option is definitely to keep daylight savings, neither summer/winter is ideal all year round
I think that permanent winter time would be better
It's much too dark in the mornings, especially for kids going to school
When I was younger I was shocked to learn that the south of France and Spain had "shorter" summer days than here, since we barely see the sun anyway
But if you're high enough latitude that you get significantly lighter evenings then in winter you won't gain any real benefit
In Athens (just picked because it's far south) the day length difference between longest/shortest days is only 5 hours, in Edinburgh its more than double that
If you kept summer time, the evenings are just as dark by the time people finish work, and everyone has to go to work before even civil twilight has started (never mind sunrise)
Having some light in the morning when you need to be more awake is more important than a brief glimmer of twilight at the end of the day imo
Sorry to hear that, hope you’re able to adjust soon
My sleep schedule is a mess already which is maybe why I didn’t notice this as a problem lol
In mid summer where I live it doesn’t actually get completely dark at all so we’d still have long summer evenings
Our national animal is a unicorn, that's super wholesome
The Meikleour Beech Hedges are the tallest in the world
Glasgow
It was the template for New York, so you can get away with all the road issues people have been talking about
Imo I'd say Glasgow obviously due to some bias but it would make some sense since Rockstar is Scottish
Even if it's not set there and maybe like London or something (Which would be my 2nd idea) it'd be cool if they made a visit to Glasgow to the schemes and all that sort of like North Yankton in GTA V
1990's Edinburgh would be an interesting choice
Rockstar has a base in the city (Rockstar North) so not impossible, and back then the city was far more criminal than it is now
Also, the contrast of the historic Old Town, rich New Town, and places like Leith (think Trainspotting) would make for very varied gameplay
The castle looming over the center would make for a great central hub/landmark
One more great thing about Edinburgh is the relitively small size compared to places like London or Paris, allowing the player to learn the geography of the place, giving it a feeling of home that may be lost in larger cities
Dundee Scotland, simply because it was created in Dundee and I think being a knife wielding drug addict would be fun
Loch Ness - There's other, prettier, quieter lochs all over the Highlands
Edinburgh Castle is also very expensive for what it is
Probably Edinburgh
Even the Scottish people there are probably English
London
You've not been to the UK if you've only been to London IMO
It doesn't represent the people here at all or what things are like nationwide
The royal mile, everything's priced through the bloody roof and very little is good enough to pay for it
Or any of those shops with tartan store fronts playing pipe music from it
They lure you in with £12 stuffed heilan coos, football scarves and the promise of selling people key rings with "their" clans Crest or arms or tartan on it
I get that as a nation we have a very strong "brand image" that people like to see and engage with and buy tourist tatt for, I get that I worked in tourism, but those shops are all the same and they're all over priced
Might get some good shortbread or tablet though
> Edinburgh Castle was really beautiful and worth the visit
Aye, I was hesitant to put Edinburgh Castle, as a lot of people do enjoy it, but I'd advise any tourist to read up on first and check that it's something they'll be into before they go, as it's still pretty steep
If you like lochs - and who doesn't? - I can recommend Loch Lomond, although it's also very busy because it's so close to Glasgow, it is easier to get to
Loch Morar also has a monster legend associated with it
> On the other hand, if they play early 2000s pop songs from their country
This is true, but on the other hand, you might prefer take the bad food to avoid being subjected to the local early-2000s pop songs

Although I hated ceilidh dancing in School, I now jump at an opportunity to put those 13 years of learning to ceilidh dance to use
I even have the most Scottish name possible without having a Mac or Mc
The only stereotypes I don’t have are that I’m not ginger (although I have a ginger beard), and I don’t have a strong accent, I’m from Edinburgh and have an American mother, so to most Scottish people I sound English or American
And I don’t care about football, rugby or golf
I own a kilt, and reckon I look pretty dashing in it whilst dancing at a ceilidh
I also drink whisky, and enjoy eating haggis
I don't eat haggis, don't particularly like whisky (but do like gin) and don't own any tartan clothing
My surname is not very Scottish but my ancestry is, as far back as I've been able to trace it
I don't belong to a clan and I'm not a red-head
I used to play the bagpipes, I own a kilt, I'm shit hot at a ceilidh, my diet is questionable, I've got a Scottish surname (albeit without Mac/Mc), occasional haggis eater, accent
I rarely drink whisky, I don't drink an excessive amount of Irn Bru, I'm not ginger (but some of my beard is)
- I do like Irn Bru although I don't drink it often because I don't drink a lot of fizzy juice
However, I don't think there's a difference between the old recipe and the new reduced sugar recipe and think people who have been crying about it are definitely exaggerating
- I don't eat haggis all that often
A couple of times a year maybe
Definitely on Rabbie Burns' day though
- I think the last time I wore a kilt was when I was 13 at my aunts wedding
- I do like whisky, but I much prefer rum as my spirit of choice
There are similarities in how they both taste, however the rules around making rum are less strict which allows for much more experimentation and creativity with flavours
- Depending on who I'm talking to, I have a strong Glaswegian accent
- I like Tennents lager
Well I had haggis for dinner yesterday and lunch and dinner today so

Sometimes in Scotland we look with envy at the power of the Irish-American lobby

Most inaccurate would have to be Braveheart
William Wallace wasn't a Highlander in a kilt, he was a medieval noble in chainmail riding about on a horse, like a knight
It seems to conflate several separate time periods, the Picts fighting the Romans (the blue paint on the face, which is conjectural in any case), the Middle Ages (when Wallace and Bruce actually lived) and the Jacobite rebellion (the 18th century)
In addition, the Battle of Stirling Bridge was fought (as the name suggests) on a bridge, not in an open field
The clichéd depictions of Scotland are actually very similar to the ones of Ireland, there's the Scot-Ireland confusion as you mention
An example of a film with plenty of Highland clichés, as well as depicting the Highlands as basically stuck in the 19th century (or before) is the 1996 film Loch Ness, where Ted Danson goes and stays in a hotel beside Loch Ness and uniquely discovers the monster
Of course the American is the voice of reason and uses his no-nonsense can-do attitude to solve the puzzle while the natives are all yokels and prefer to remain stuck in the past
To be honest looks exactly like the east end of Glasgow
In which the Scotsman was played by a barely-anglophone Frenchman, and the Egyptian with a Spanish name was played with a broad Edinburgh accent

That's odd, as I reckon most people wouldn't recognise our national anthem, whereas there's a couple of pipe tunes (well, one), that I reckon folk would recognise instead

In South America, some people like to blame the UK for starting the Paraguayan War too, because they claim that Paraguay had successfully industrialised on its own or something of the sort
Of course, the bit where Paraguay's army invaded Brazil, after Brazil intervened in Uruguay's internal conflicts, is seemingly ignored

We would get Berwick-upon-Tweed again, so having him lose an election up here is a price I'm willing to pay
Technically there would be a thin strip of England remaining, since Hadrian's wall is south of the current border

> we’re the only British colony (besides Rhodesia) to separate in a bloody and unilateral way
Why do you need to have this sort of daft American exceptionalism
Nobody else would hit out with this sort of "We're the only ones who done this except from these other people who done it".
>So the constitution makes the access to firearms as a universal right
It doesn't *actually* though, because as we know there are plenty of things that can stop someone getting a gun legally
It's just not applied universally
If it's not a universal background check, it allows people to exploit loopholes
Only the states I listed have fully comprehensive universal background checks, from what I can find
> I didn’t say anything about American exceptionalism what are you on about
The section of your comment I quoted is an example of American Exceptionalism
"we’re the only British colony (besides Rhodesia) to separate in a bloody and unilateral way
Why bother saying this
You're basically just saying "We're not the only British colony to separate in a bloody and unilateral way", but you need to make it about the US for reasons of daft American Exceptionalism
>The second amendment says “the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed
” Which is a direct statement guaranteeing the right to own a firearm
Yet there are many restrictions that exist, so we know it's not a universal right
>Background checks do not violate the constitution
Background checks prevent people (rightly) from getting guns
So either you don't know what infringe means, or you don't know what universal means
Which is it
You can't say something is a universal right whilst simultaneously having restrictions on it
> I wasn’t aware that stating relevant historical examples was American exceptionalism
Let me explain it to you again
You claimed:
"we’re the only British colony (besides Rhodesia) to separate in a bloody and unilateral way
That means the US is not the only British colony to separate in a blood and unilateral way, **because Rhodesia also done it**.
So why would you preface your comment with "We're the only" if you're *not* the only ones to have done it
It's like someone saying "I'm the only person to run the 100m in under 10 seconds, except that other guy who done it as well
The American Exceptionalism comes from the false claim you're the only ones to have done it
What's wrong with saying "The US and Rhodesia are the only two British colonies to to separate in a bloody and unilateral way
>Also I speak English I know what infringe and universal means
Imagine you rent a flat, and in the contract it says you have universal access to a swimming pool in the back, and then the landlord says "But you can't use it on weekends".
Do you still have universal access
Or have they infringed your "universal access" stated in the contract

Dundee
It used to be a post industrial shitehole, and fared poorly in comparison* to oil boom Aberdeen
Dundonians are generally well politically engaged though+, and have had the sense to elect a few decades worth of good local politicians that have made a real effort to improve the city, and it's now something of a cultural hub
In addition, it's close to some very pretty scenery in Fife and the Angus glens, so would make a good base for exploring further afield, and the two universities in a small city make for a lively nightlife during term time
*Dundee and Aberdeen are both east coast cities, but quite far apart
The media often seems to align the two cities as near neighbours and rivals, simply because both are beyond the Central Belt, and the media isn't entirely sure where each one is
+ Dundee once rejected Winston Churchill as their MP, preferring to vote for a temperance (anti-alcohol campaigner) MP instead
Yep, they were so anti-Churchill, they voted for prohibition instead
I actually enjoy going to Aberdeen, just not for too long

Thankfully Angus chased Zargothrax into space and we've not had Unicorn incidents since then
It doesn't really get mocked for being boring, normally more that's it a bit down at heel, and a bit rough
The V&A is impressive, and the Discovery Museum has also been well regarded for a while
The tech hub side of it is interesting, as a lot of that stems from the output of Abertay University
Dundee has been much better at linking it's universities with industries in the city than other places
I think the hospital's out by the ring road/A90 to the south, so I'd imagine it's pretty quiet around there
The city centre's pretty small, and you'd definitely need a car to get to the interesting places round and about
That all depends where you did go to uni though
was it another best kept secret
Apologies, that one passed me by completely
So to Serbians Scotland is the land of bastards ?

We also find that the bigger country controls the narrative not just on their own news, but on our news too
So we find ourselves having our own country explained back to us, mostly incorrectly
Especially when the news from England is about a devolved matter, and is therefore specifically irrelevant to NI
It's also worth keeping an eye out for how often news about NI is shown from an English perspective
Throughout the Troubles, the phrase, "Last night another soldier
" became famous as it was how an incident in NI was announced on the news
Military casualties were seen as more important, because the victim could come from somewhere else in the UK, whereas civilians were just locals
Maybe this is what you meant, but if you add "portugal" *with the quotes*, all results will contain that exact word
Otherwise google will try and be clever and include 'portuguese' etc

In Scotland and for the Scottish Parliament things are slightly different compared to Westminster
Instead of the FPTP mess, we have proportional representation and numbered choices on the ballot
I like it because you can both choose exactly what you believe in (as much as any single party can be that), then continue choosing the lesser evils in the alternative options until you decide "that's too evil for me, and I'd rather not even dignify this party with a mark of my pencil" and not choose them at all
I normally end up making choices up to 3 and leave the other 3 blank
Thankfully also for Westminster elections, my party have become quite strongly represented, so I can vote for them with my single vote confidently without guiltily crossing another party's box instead
I voted for the first time last year right after turning 18, and I voted for the party I genuinely believed in
I like that party less now due to leadership changes and they didn't win the election or my constituency, but I'm happy with my vote last year
We have a Scottish Parliament election next year which functions a bit differently and I'll have to do a lot of research before that to decide who to vote for

Columbus is notable because he actually went back to Spain, told them about what he found, and initiated the Colombian exchange that would change the course of history
> Brits do not like to be told by Americans we'd be speaking German if it wasn't for them
Do they not realise how bad we are at languages
that doesn't make it any less annoying/patronising though
That's largely a Spongebob joke, I believe
Columbus day was created by the Italian diaspora in the USA, who wanted to assimilate and show that they had their own national heroes who contributed to the making of the nation
Nowadays, Columbus Day is under a lot of criticism because colonisation of the Americas was a bit of a shit deal for the Indigenous population, and he is increasingly seen in a bad light (not just in the USA mind you, the statue of Columbus in Buenos Aires's presidential house was also subject to criticism and removed)

Yeah this is good, my choices for the extracts used were not that great
There's much more ordinary early middle English than a Shakespeare play, the middle English is probably actually too easy and extract and Beowolf was me being a bit lazy
Yeah that all this is literary language and as such might not be too representative of how people actually spoke is probably a good point
I imagine all of us might have an easier time understand a more normal conversation
Here's a more normal conversation someone reconstructed [ I can get quite a lot of the words from that
Yeah I understand the Ukrainian thing, for a person like me who understands Scots pretty well but wouldn't call myself a full speaker the trippiest thing is listening to a person with a very well spoken upper class accent speaking in a dialect that I struggle with like Doric or Orcadian because it sounds almost like a posh person speaking standard English one sentence and then goes completely off into something that sounds more like badly pronounced Swedish the next sentance
Would you say that in your opinion from Scots seems as different to English as standardised German is to Dutch
I'm kind of interested in just how different it is considering the fight over if it counts as a language or not
Yeah sorry I probably should have included them:
&#x200B;
The early modern English (Macbeth) is 1606
The middle English (The Canterbury Tales) is 1387 to 1400
The first old English (beowulf) is 975 to 1025 but the poem may have potentially have been first written a couple hundred years earlier
The second old English (Cædmon's Hymn) is 658 to 680
The Scots (The Bible) is I believe 1983 but it uses functionally modern Scots
The use of ‘wood’ for an army is a plot point in Macbeth, which is where the text is from
Macbeth is told by the three witches that he will only be defeated when Birnam Wood comes to his castle, Dunsinane
Macbeth thinks that this means he is invincible - how can a wood come to his castle
His castle is then attacked by his enemy Malcolm, who has his men camouflage themselves with branches from the Birnam Wood - so the Wood comes to the castle and Macbeth is defeated
>Early modern: with some difficulty
The most baffling bit is how the writer uses the word "wood" for
an army
Haha sorry, yeah this is part of the play rather than a language issue, the story is basically that an early Scottish king gets a prophecy from some witches saying he will be king and he wont die until Birnam wood comes to the town of Dunsinane, to make the prophecy true he kills the king but his sons run away to England, when they come back they cut down and use the trees of Burnam wood to disguise their army (or possibly the numbers of their army) so the prophecy is fulfilled and the usurper is killed
Bairn means baby or child, not beforehand in Scots
I think most of us can pick out a lot of words especially people who understand Scots or highly divergent dialects of English like the old Northern dialects but are far from understanding
Yeah that would be interesting, there's a video out there somewhere of an old English hobbyest who goes to Frisland and is able to speak to people in old English and have them more or less understand him
This is pretty great, do you feel that your ability to speak Dutch gives you any advantage understanding this
And are you able to make much sense of the old English given the linguistic similarities between Dutch and Old English
I think I may have chosen too easy a middle English one as typically native Brits find the Canterbury Tales where I took it from pretty difficult but everyone can understand it here

Here's a possibly more difficult excerpt from the same compilation
>With torment and with shamful deth echon
>This provost dooth thise Iewes for to sterve

>Yvel shal have, that yvel wol deserve
>Therfor with wilde hors he dide hem drawe,
>And after that he heng hem by the lawe
Yeah I didn't choose a great extract for middle English here's a slightly harder one

>With torment and with shamful deth echon
>This provost dooth thise Iewes for to sterve
>That of this mordre wiste, and that anon;

Now we shall honour the guardian of heaven, the might of the architect, and his purpose,the work of the father of glory as he, the eternal lord, established the beginning of wonders; he first created for the children of men heaven as a roof, the holy creator Then the guardian of mankind, the eternal lord, afterwards appointed the middle earth, the lands for men, the lord god almighty
I think the issue with the Scots is it has a lot more non English influence particularly from the Scandinavian languages but also a bit from medieval French, Latin and the Celtic languages giving it words that look a bit weird
Yeah, the problem with that is that it's part of a Shakespear play so you get less context for everything in that than for the others
That's interesting, I would have suspected it to be more difficult given how English is kind of famously a sponge for influence and changes fairly quickly
Though that might have been my bad choice of extract
Am a Gaelic speaker (learned/learning not native) nope nothing
Remember English doesn't come from the celtic languages
Approximately 30% of Scots say they can speak scots with something like 150,00 speaking Scots most of the time
Could you see if you can understand this in scots
I think most people are put off by the weird orthography, looking at it it seems really off but I suspect most people here can pick out a few words
Yeah although some people here are saying its much more similar to English than Dutch is to German
I wonder if I picked either a too familiar or too anglified scots extract but it's kind of difficult for me to know as I'm far from unfamiliar with the Scots language
Perhaps some very derived Ulster scots or some strong doric might be more similar to Dutch to German but I'd need a German's opinion to know
Shite that's Izzard
I never made the connection but it seems obvious now
I'm not an expert (as is made clear by this thread) but I think he pulled significantly from a lot of different forms of English present at the time and also some older English which is why he's so influential in creating modern English
It's not nessicary that that makes it difficult though it's how complicated the words are
Yeah I mean I can understand that though and my German is at a preschool level
Yeah figured as much, I've heard it said that it's about as similar as different Scandinavian languages are to each other but I'm not really sure
Ah ok
Here you go  [
Note to self: When choosing middle English extracts don't go for the one with Jew murder
&#x200B;
Yeah pretty much
&#x200B;
>With torture and with shameful death, each one, The provost did these cursed Hebrews serve Who of the murder knew, and that anon; From justice to the villains he'd not swerve
"Evil shall have what evil does deserve
" And therefore, with wild horses, did he draw, And after hang, their bodies, all by law
Maybe, I wonder if it says more about Greek though, I wonder if it went under a lot of influence while under occupation
That's pretty good, I doubt most Scots could get all of that
Hmm that's interesting as I've heard the opposite before from a Swede
If you wouldn't mind could you listen to this 40 second video of spoken Doric Scots and see what you think
Ahhh that makes more sense now
Here's a clip of more typical spoken Doric if you want to give it a shot  [
Old English isn't that similar to Icelandic or old Norse though
It comes from the languages of the old continental North Sea coast with the closest modern relative language (excluding Scots) being Frisian
Yeah your video is scots but it's quite anglified and not really broad scots
Its in the same dialect as the prayer but it's more if an example of the accent than the full dialect
The one I sent you is quite derived scots in a tricky dialect though
I'm really not convinced of this, do you have a source for this
It shouldn't really be much more intelligible than modern Danish and German are to each other given the history
&#x200B;
Certainly in later times though old English went under a significant influence from Old Norse
Hmmm that's interesting, I'll read through that thesis but I'm not sure how that could be the case given old west Germanic is very much different to old north Germanic and Old English is very clearly an old west Germanic derived language more in the grouping with modern German and Dutch
My town has a touch March from the centre of town up the small mountain at the back of the town on new year
It started from when the area was controlled by the vikings as a celebration of a good year (or something along those lines)
Then we also burn a wooden model ship
It not really a Scottish thing but it’s popular in areas that have large Nordic connections like the Shetlands, outer Hebrides and parts of Argyll
Wait, *Freya*? Is this because of the Suebi and Gothic settlers in Iberia
Isn't the North American Halloween an amalgamation of different traditions from Ireland and Britain
I mean, I probably got a biased account of it, but I was taught that the tradition of dressing in costumes was a Scottish thing originally
Celebrate the *failure* of the terrorist attack
Celebrations consist of burning Guy Fawkes in a pyre
It's literally a reenacted mass lynching
And Orkney
There's a reason why Protestants considered Catholics to be heretical lmao
See also: all those armoured skeletons and corpses of holy figures that are preserved and displayed in Catholic churches throughout Europe
Fucking hell, she must have been a real bitch for everyone to get so mad at her
The Germanic Suebi and Goths settled in Iberia after the Western Roman Empire fell
There are a few words and names in Iberian languages that are actually Germanic in origin (iirc "Guerra" is Germanic in origin)
Well we have Boris Johnson who is about as incoherent as you can get
Quite respectable tbh, surprised he chose to do it in English instead of French though
It's amazing what you can get away with when you're wealthy and have an RP accent
If you want more dictators speaking English, Mussolini actually made a short video addressed to the Italian-American diaspora
It's strange
The same clowns that praise his attempts at ancient Greek look down their nose at Welsh and Gaelic speakers for "speaking a dead language".
Using long words is not the same as eloquence
He struggles to string a coherent sentence together
I've never seen someone look down on people actually speaking gaelic
What i have seen is people asking why we need to have gaelic road signs everywhere and *ambuleans* / *poileas* vehicles
I don't know about *only* private high schools, but it's certainly more common there, and is seen as a symbol of social class
No, the difference is that neither Welsh nor Gaelic are dead languages
I think you just summed up Irish politics with that
> I asked also because i imagine that scots would be more interested in learning UK’s old languages than latin or greek
Gaelic specifically, rather than all of the UK's languages
It's also worth noting that Gaelic is a *living* language
Whilst it's got ancient roots, it's still the general language of everyday life in a few parts of Scotland, so it's not comparable to Latin or Ancient Greek in that sense
It's dismissed as a 'dead language' by bigots who genuinely seem threatened by the UK not being a monoculture
Look at the other comment in this thread in scared, emotive language about children in Wales being *forced* to learn Welsh, rather than the neutral phrasing of Welsh forming part of the curriculum in Wales
In Scotland, they removed most of the sugar from Irn Bru
Diabolical
Don’t t forget the English all but destroying Scottish and Irish culture
Banning kilts at one point just to piss us off
Banning children from speaking Gaelic in school, punishing them when they did
Killing the men and raping many Scottish women, trying make Scots look less Scottish over time
They still did contribute a lot to it .
Doesn’t excuse it though, like saying, an older child is fighting with a younger child, so an adult kills the younger child
You seem pretty salty about something I don’t actually care that much about
Clearly, you think that everybody who says anything negative about anything is trying to act a victim
The rich lowland Scots profited greatly, everyone else in Scotland did not
Same in England, because Scotland has less people and they were more spread out, that would skew the numbers
The rich (in the empire) profited, the poor did not, sane everywhere
The lowland Scots didn’t speak Gaelic, they spoke Scots, which was also seen as being a commoners language by the rich and the English
Scots was also, and is still (talking from experience) punished in school for speaking
I never mentioned the highland clearances once
It wouldn’t have happened (at least to the same extent) if the English hadn’t supported it
I’m not completely blaming England (at least I didn’t mean to),
What I meant was an older child is beating up a younger child, then the adult delivers the final blow
The adult is still involved, but the older child did most of it, although the adult still did help
How do you know what I care about
Read through most of the comments, I don’t give a shit, it’s something I said of the top of my head from my memory that you’ve taken a little too seriously
Also, “pretty much dead outside the highlands” the highlands is about half of the country (in land area before you start talking about population)
English and Scottish were very dark distinct back (lowland and midland), the borders were different, but the cultures were different
That’s why Scots tend to prefer the Irish to the English
False claims of what
What have I said that has been outright false here
(Not just slightly inaccurate or missing parts)
The last part of it, was mainly the English
The part about Gaelic culture was committed by both
I said and didn’t miss out part of it, which is what you are now talking about
As Scotland
Maybe when our Parliament sold the country to England so that the nobility could be bailed out after the Darien Scheme
As someone else mentioned the Highland Clearances were also a pretty dark spell in Scottish history
As Britain, exporting food during famines in colonies is a real low point
Forcing China to import our opium is also a pretty shameful point in our past
...and Austrians
You really pissed of some Englishmen
Those lassies burned one of their songs into my head in the 90s and it's still fucking there
*Say you will, say you won't*
*Say you'll do what I don't*
*Say you're true, say to me, "C'est la vie"*
Growing up in the UK this feeling always had its own specific televisual accompaniment: Time Team (a programme about archaeology), Songs of Praise (Christianity-lite), and Antiques Roadshow (a programme about old vases and crap that people found in their attics)
Every Sunday it was the same
In Scotland there are a few places where certain pagan rituals are still practiced, though normally in a diluted fashion
In my family people go down into the garden or grass before first light on the first day of spring to wash their face in the morning dew for health and beauty and to "wash off the winter" or something like that idk
I can never be bothered getting up that early, though I've done it a few times
It's quite bracing
Not ancient but on Robert Burns' Birthday we have a dance, a meal of hagis neeps and taties and drink
Also say old Burns poems
A Scot who doesn't rate IRN BRU
Heathens the lot of them
A Scottish person who doesn't like anything another Scottish person likes
It is called the No True Scotsman Fallacy after all
A non-binge drinking Scot
Scottish born n raised, I don't like haggis
same with us scots
Same, I might have well have been from Mars when my friends were chatting about the Prem in secondary school
Yes we have had a few but normally that's just because it's a period where we weren't getting shit on by the English or some other nation
Kaunas during the interbellum really did sound pretty awesome
Agree that an unfortunately large number of people oddly seem to think the Empire was the golden age
Especially odd that a number of working class people think that now, they would have been/still are fucked by a government that has imperialist interests
Personally think the "Golden Age" would be the breakup of the Empire but the breakup of the UK will be the future golden age
I take it that Vladislaus II is not up there
Not really, sooner the countries being held under the command of England/"United" Kingdom are freed of it, the better
The Union may have once been beneficial for more than just England (and by this I mostly mean those not a member of the working class) but not any longer
I know tis why I was mentioning it
Both bad kings of Hungary especially king very well
Whatever we vote in Scotland (MPs, Brexit, things voted on in Parliament) we are vastly outnumbered and can be easily voted down, this goes with the cultures of Scotland and England are becoming further apart particularly in a political sense with England wanting to go more right wing (even the North which is astounding to me after what The Witch did to it in the 70's) while Scotland is embracing a more centre of left position
More powers to the Scottish Government are sorely needed and repeatedly rejected by Westminster
Nuclear weapons are a ridiculous prospect and one the British government is continually entertaining while most of the Scottish government and the people of Scotland also, being aware of what a waste of money and resources it is along with the environmental impact
To the other person who has mentioned the previous referendum, that was before the people of Scotland voted in great majority to stay within the EU and being promised much greater powers in government
While the latter was partially fulfilled, the former was outright broken
Edit: I'm happy to hear the benefits of the union but frankly I don't imagine they will outweigh the cons
>when your car has issues with some of the parts, you don’t scrap the whole car
While that's true for maybe an aspect of suspension, the exhaust or maybe even something as big as the radiator, if the engine is broken then maybe it's time to look at a new car
The engine is busted, Westminster has repeatedly shrugged off the responsibility and ignored the issues because it has the power so it doesn't need to look at these issues seriously
This is why we (and personally I believe the other nations do too) need independence so that we in Scotland have say over our own present and futures, not people who have never lived here, been here and do not see the lives of people out with their ivory towers
The link you've provided is *okay*, I remember reading most of those arguments when I voted to remain within the UK
The sad part is that large aspects of it are untrue; we haven't seen high public spending like promised with austerity still being the policy being followed by the Tories, interest rates have plummeted anyway (before COVID and exacerbated more so by it), economic arguments about saving money by staying in the UK are void by the excessive amount spent on Brexit before we've even ended the transition period which ties into us having a big voice by staying in the EU
As for currency I'd happily adopt the dollar or the euro
Politics doesn't have to be an issue shared across the UK with four nations with vastly different political stances and situations
Perhaps Wales may struggle, I'm not Welsh and haven't really looked into what Wales' industries are nevermind a Welsh independence, Scotland on the other hand has enough industry to keep itself afloat and that would even be on a greener standpoint of leaving much of the oil in the ground
&#x200B;
At this point I'm going to assume you're English (not an attack point, just an assumption) and I make this assumption because of your points in two statements:
\> small gains from leaving the UK would be outweighed by the losses
\> issues surrounding Scottish Independence aren’t talked about as much except for an occasional speech
The pain of being dragged around by an archaic system against most of a country's will along with (what I imagine won't really be your fault, more the company you perhaps keep and where you stay) not seeing or hearing these issues talked about "except for an occasional speech".
The political differences I would highlight are England's increasing euroscepticism and desire for American Republican stances alongside growing economic innequality which is being roundly enforced by 10 years of Tory rule
Apologies if my argument was confusing, looking back I can see how, I'm advocating for Scottish Independence primarily and while I think Irish independence/reunification is a good move that's another ball game
Scottish Independence and if the rest of the UK goes I don't think it would be too sad a day but I don't know the complexities of the other countries' situations, economics, etc
You're correct on attention in news but until there's enough momentum at a particular point, significant marches in cities and so on it's not newsworthy especially to outlets like the BBC, Daily Fail, The S-n, Daily Shitpress and The Torygraph (all government and gov doner mouthpieces)
While people in England may not be overly keen on A.Rep-ism, a large amount of people in England are overly fond of the Tories who are playing games increasingly like the Republicans
I understand it isn't all but it is an upsettingly large amount
The fact that "we're probably stuck with them" until one other party emerges is broken, so horribly broken and yet another reason why Scotland should break from the UK
Kier Starmer is forming a good backbone to Labour in England lately but to wait for England to stop feeling hurt by the *big bad labour party* (*wobbles lip*) because of FPTP being a broken, archaic system is ridiculous
Edit: formatting
I believe the independence of Scotland will be a golden age, whether that's true for the UK as well as Scotland will remain to be seen however dismantling imperialism further will certainly be a good step for all the countries involved
&#x200B;
At the time I was younger and lived in an area that was LD, now Tory with a very heavy Better Together aspect, the few Independence supporters seemed like zealots and screamed and screamed about it, that along with the cuddly cute approach of BT (while also scaremongering enough to make you believe leaving the UK would be a disaster) made me believe that leaving the UK would result in economic doom with Scotland not being able to stand on one leg

Propoganda works
In a Paris Metro station I seen a homeless guy having a wank while watching people walk by
It was absolutely surreal
Winston Churchill was chased out of our city when he was our MP
He then became Prime Minister (twice) and purposely cut funding for projects here

Some sheep are just wee bastards
Always are
The north east is often bypassed by tourists
It's not as spectacular as the west coast, but there's some very pretty mountain areas in Upper Deeside, and a spectacular coastline south of Aberdeen, including the dramatic Dunnotter Castle
The north east also has lots of the whisky distilleries
At the other end of the country, large areas of Dumfries and Galloway are scenic wilderness, much less visited and more remote than parts of the Highlands, albeit with lower hills
As a Brit, I feel Durham deserves more love, really really stunning city
You can have a good time just looking around the colleges which are all beautiful
Pints are also pretty cheap too :)
For Spain I would say somewhere like Ciuadad Rodrigo or Salamanca, incredibly beautiful but not that many foreign tourists
Inverness is nothing special, but it's within easy travelling distance of some very impressive places, so it makes a good base
Thurso can probably be bypassed, to be honest, but makes a useful stop before getting the Orkney ferry
Orkney and Shetland are beautiful, and definitely worth the visit
They're both similar to, and yet quite different from, the rest of Scotland
Students probably, I know there is a good university there but i didn't see that many stereotypical foreign tourists when I have been there (four times I think) maybe because the city is more historical
Lovely food and incredible views, especially the cathedral
I think he meant cold like the attitude rather than the temperature
I was always taught German was the most sensible language to learn because of the size of the German economy
However, I know many people say this is actually quite pointless because those same Germans you’d work with will likely be proficient in English
French is a very useful language if you are interested in working in Africa
German in central Europe but probably Spanish in general especially as conversational level Spanish can very easily become conversational level Italian and Portuguese and with a bit of effort conversational Romanian and French if needed while also being a pretty influential language by itself
I think they also banned importing certain Japanese anime related products because it's too close to Child porn
Margaret Thatcher
There were street celebrations all over Scotland when she died
Historically speaking maybe, Oliver Cromwell or Charles the 1st
Now a days maybe Margret thatcher
Probably Thatcher or if you mean right this moment: big BJ himself
Depends who you ask
William of Orange and Margaret Thatcher are strong candidates though
John Menteith
The first that springs to mind anyway
He betrayed William Wallace aka Brave heart and led to his brutal execution
You can throw that piece of shit Katie Hopkins under the bus along with that jello Petri dish
Maybe the blueshirts leader Duffy
Fascist cunt
Honestly naebody gies that much of a fuck about the royal family unless you're a tabloid journalist or >60
> Unemployment soared to almost Great Depression levels as factory after factory was sacrificed to her cause of monetarist efficiency
Some 20% of the total Scottish workforce lost their jobs in the years 1981 to 1983, with Scottish unemployment regularly 15 to 20% worse than down south, and the government in London only did one thing – they changed the method of calculation so that the figures did not look so bad
Yet still by January, 1985, Scottish unemployment reached 400,000 for the first time since the 1930s.
Aye dev seemed like a tyrant in private tbh, also not a great fan of the theocratic policies he brought in
I remember as a young child, I was told to boo her when she was on TV for closing down the local villages' coal mines and that she was a "very bad lady
" That wasn't by my parents, but the elderly couple who lived next door to us
Thank you kind stranger, that means a lot
Also places in the North of England like Liverpool and Newcastle had a just as bad experience
And Wales
And Northern Ireland (made it even more decisive,  Basically anywhere that wasn't the South of England
And to be honest, that hasn't really changed to this day
I don't know if my answer will count, (probably not), but I've never heard anyone do an actual proper thick-ish Scottish accent correctly
The best fake Scottish accent I've ever heard that I can at least think of is probably Sick Boy from Trainspotting, I was surprised to find out he's actually English
But then again, the accent he was doing isn't exactly thick, and now that I realise he's English I can hear some bits here and there that sound English
Uhm
just don't.
I think with English it's easy to get an accent that rather being definitively non native is more sort of difficult to place
A lot of Europeans who learn English sort of sound like they might be from Eastern Canada but that they might have grown up in Ireland or something
It's hard to work out where they're from if they're fluent enough but they don't sound like they're from any particular place
I dunno about accent cos Ive no heard of anyone whos tried
but our dialect isn't very hard to learn
don't try it, please, please don't. I've heard so many "Scottish" accents done and next to none are good
The only non-Scot I've ever heard do a convincing Scottish accent is Jonny Lee Miller in Trainspotting
I had friends from Poland and learned a little from them
It’s such a hard language, and the best compliment I ever got was ‘you speak Polish well, like you have polish parents but were raised in the UK’
Most people who say the speaking is easy, are usually talking about an American accent
I'd love to hear them say that when listening to me lol
Scottish in particular is hard to emulate
Most folk I know who try to emulate our speech make one major mistake, they speak too slow as they’re too focused on making the correct sounds so they end up sounding ridiculous
We speak fast, and that’s the hardest bit to get right from experience
Most of the people who did were forced to assimilate
It was still a dying language before that too
I'm sure it's only 1
1% speak it nowadays
I’ve left voicemails for family in England and been told ‘I knew it was you because I couldn’t understand a word you said, please speak slower’
Yes
Out of the 37
5 hour working week, I maybe spend 50% of that actually doing work, if I'm lucky
I’d be concerned about any negative economic implications, especially in the recession that’s undoubtedly coming but I would like to see this implemented
I think this would be good for people’s mental health and time with families
Side note: as a nurse I don’t believe there is enough staff available for hospitals and outpatient services to allow for this in healthcare
I used to work 4 days a week 12 hours a day Wednesday through Saturday
It was pretty good tbh, much more spare time as during the days that I work usually that dominates that day if it's 6 hours or 12
&#x200B;
If current projections hold true the work week will likely shift to more of a 30 hour average somewhere in the 2040s from something like a 38 hour average right now so some time in the next 20 years in general as a country we do need to consider moving towards a 4 or even maybe 3 day working week
Not having to do this is the best part of the current lockdown situation imo
Well perhaps for some areas, I don’t see how this would affect routine referrals to outpatient clinics
Why don't we just work 7 days a week and not get paid while we're at it
A six hour week
That’s less than one shift
I would really like to thank Norway for the big christmas tree we get each year
Ik we do thank you each year, bur I personally would like to thank you all
Its one of my favourite traditions, it really touches me tbh
It may only be a christmas tree to most people but its a constant reminder of the history of our two countries, how we've always had each others backs, brothers and sisters across the sea there for each other no matter what
I remember the first time I actually saw it in person, it was night time and looked beautiful I was just flooded with emotion I actually did cry a little
Thank you to all the Norweigans out there, you have a wonderful country and I appreciate all you do for us Brits :)
You need to try Romney's Kendal mint cakes, especially the chocolate covered one
After Eights on steroids
Thank you for the kaassoufflé!
>The English for inventing football
Friendship ended with Wales
Now Ireland is my best friend
We should have an auld alliance visa for scots and French after brexit, just to piss the english off
Appreciate it brother across the sea
Dunno about the other scots but I always wanted to be considered a Nordic country
I speak English and no one understands me outside of Scotland lol
It’s not part of the question but I know people that can speak Scots Gaelic can sort of muddle through Irish Gaelic and vice versa
It’s a case of same but different
As a speaker of Brazilian Portuguese I understand the Spaniards better than the Portuguese
Dont be, I really should slow down when I speak lol
Oh yeah that's true, mind you if you joined us and became part of Scotland we might actually have a decent football team lol
Haha no we are both too lazy to adapt at very least, I used to work with a German girl she was married to someone from near my hometown and could understand me
I got a bit of a surprise the first time lol
&#x200B;
Never seen Broadchurch but I think that was Dorset
Could work aye
Doctor who might be a place to start, it's fun
I should relearn German I used to know some from school
It's not a telephone box, that's a disguise lol
Everyday as a fellow English speaking nation we get the stream of American news continuously
As a result I think we are more easily affected by whatever political/media situations are happening on your side of the pond
I don't like it or want it, Fox news etc are some of the worst creations of man
Nearly daily, especially in an election year
UK BBC TV News covers more American politics than it does Scottish
Not that often
Only when Trump does something stupid or there is some big event like a protest
We have enough shit of our own happening over here with COVID, Brexit and everything else
Channel 4 news in particular seems absolutely obsessed with America
> or r/whitepeopletwitter
Well, there's your problem, a "white people twitter" is a very American (or Canadian) concept to begin with
I have noticed this race sickness in the Anglo-Celtic world (USA, Canada, UK, Australia, NZ)
Race is a constant topic, it's mentioned all the time, it's in everyone's minds, always
Having a "whitepeopletwitter" should be as absurd as having a "brown eyed people twitter", that's how absurd the situation is
Go on /r/politics, /r/canada, /r/australia, /r/newzealand, or /r/unitedkingdom
There is a thread about race all the fucking time
It's always something about "white people do this", "brown people be that", yada yada
I feel like I'm losing my fucking mind, but I've reached the point where I get apoplectic whenever a friend of mine feels like bringing up someone's race when it's unnecessary (e.g. we were discussing the American electoral college, and my friend said "they're a bunch of old *white* guys", as if the flaws present in the system are somehow related to skin colour or representation, as opposed to it simply being a quaint and antiquated system that would function the same way it does now regardless of race)
**Too long; didn't read**: race consciousness exists, and it's cancerous
But we can digest it easier, the Brit can read anything printed in the states directly as its in his native tongue compared to any other nationality since they either have to read it in their second language or its filter through a translation which is often edited
Brits however get full exposure especially to the smaller ones that are not CNN etc since they would unlikely be covered in translated news
I imagine that breitbart is much more shared on UK SM compared to French SM
> he US news is covered just as much in other European countries as it is in the UK
True, but many young Europeans speak English as well, so they've become part of the "english speaking" market
It's not a recent development, elections have always been "entertainment drama"
Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, those high brow, stoic, intellectual academics who led the USA in its fights for Independence
They accused each other of being Hermaphrodites and Rapists during their contested election
Yep
It's especially noticeable when countries like New Zealand (only 4 million people) get WAY more coverage than countries like Indonesia (200+ million
Tbh if you go far back enough to the 6th century, the English and Dutch would also share a lot of common ancestry (iirc Frisian is the closest language to English, outside of Scots or Patois languages)
> People have opininos about US politics in a way they would never have about the internal politics of another country - I would say that for the average Dane, the US political system is familiar but the one in neighboring Germany, a very important country, is quite obscure in comparison
Exact same issue in the UK
The average person, Scottish or English, seems to be more invested in the USA than in their own local politics sometimes
People barely know anything about internal politics in France, or our Commonwealth cousins in Canada and Australia, but EVERYONE has an opinion on internal American matters (some of which are surprisingly obscure)
I think Brexit was the point where I realised that I felt more European than British
When I found out the result of the referendum I was devastated, and it felt like a betrayal
My hope is that in the long term, people will realise that nationality is not important (cultural identity is)
I think the EU is the best chance we have of achieving this at present
In so far as making a new European superstate, no
I also think that would be a poor idea, and likely cause breakaways as countries happy to be in an international organisation face electoral backlash at being annexed into a larger state, and the surrender of powers that entails for already more peripheral countries
Like, quite a lot of countries don't take EU elections seriously because they don't feel like it ever matters or changes, it s more like polling for the next GE
There's also the question of if countries that have a history of trying for their own independence would be happy being in a singular nation dominated by Germany and France
While there is some pan-European identity, it's very broad strokes, and I heavily doubt it's enough to weld a new nation together
Maybe France, Germany, and the Benelux region, I wonder if an independent Scotland would want to be dominated by conservative Germans with different political and cultural ideals in the same way we complain about the English, who are culturally and politically a lot more like us
Similarly, I expect that to play out with a few of the countries on the periphery who are happy for cooperation but not becoming a minor territory of a new state
Also, in general the idea of making yet another superstate, like the US, China, seems pretty terrible, they are inherently a lot less democratic and responsive to the population due to their size and don't have a good record when it comes to throwing their weight around
I vastly prefer the EUs farmers cooperative current model to trying to make it into the corporate farming conglomerate that a superstate would be
The former seems a lot fairer and sustainable than the latter
I would definitely disagree about stonehenge
At least for me it was much bigger and more impressive than I expected, and it's more about the history than the sight itself anyway
Me and my mum did one of those open top bus tours through Copenhagen
The little mermaid stop was so overcrowded and busy we didn’t even get off the bus there
I find that Edinburgh is a little the same, there's an awful lot of tourist shops blaring bagpipes with cheap kilts and weird ginger wigs, although there are lovely parts the city centre doesn't really represent Scotland
The only people I know who go to Ayia Napa are people looking for a cheaper version of Ibiza/Magaluf

> I remember last year some English pals of mine went on a trip to Ibiza and the photos and videos they shared were of them in places surrounded by other Brits where everything was in English
Did they go to Ibiza to party
That's probably the reason why they went to the likes of San Antonia/Playa Den Bossa
Outside of those two places, Ibiza is actually a stunning island
Benidorm is basically where all the neddy/chavy folk from the UK go
Thank god though, because it means they bypass Alicante and leave it untouched for the rest of us

Glad you enjoyed it
And I plan to move to the Highlands at some point but I’m still in school so I don’t have much of an option rn lol
I once went to the customs office here in Frankfurt to get a parcel a friend sent me
They asked what was in it and I, an idiot, said, "ein Gift" - then I remembered that means poison in German and freaked out apologising
The worker was clearly used to foreigners making this same dumb mistake and just looked bored by me dying inside, so it was fine
Also aktuell (current) v actual (real/truly existing)
Also very nitpicky but the -chs isn't pronounced like a hard X as in the English sex, is it
Yeh Scotland's a pretty great place to live
Wouldn't want to leave forever
I love Living in Scotland
but if we don't shift that lot from down South and I had to consider moving it would be Germany or Czech Republic for sure
Fell in love with both places as soon as I visited
I used to
Then Brexit happened and I feel further and further away from a country I grew up in every day
My plans are to relocate to German at some point in the next year or two
Are you from Slovenia
If not, how did you find learning the language
I visited Slovenia a couple of years ago and it is by far my most favourite country, I’d love to live there
A Scottish person not pining for warmer weather
I'd say pretty good
No natural disasters, the weather is
consistent
We weren’t that bad (not speaking for England)
I married a foreigner (German) and she wanted to move back, but once you've moved once it's much easier to do it again
So now I'm in Netherlands where I get paid more, the job's more interesting, the work life balance is better and so is the weather
I don't think I could justify taking my family back and loosing all those perks
Scottish weather is crap, we do have amazing hills and lochs but the rain changes plans so often
Most people here are about the pub lifestyle
> I don't think I could justify taking my family back and loosing all those perks
Ach
I feel you
We are in the process of moving from the Netherlands back to Scotland
There's a lot that we'll miss
But after a while I just felt homesick
We get clear skies <10 times a year
Looking at the forecast for the next 2 weeks, not a single day isn't cloudy
As a comparison on the west coast of Scotland we got 1250 mm of rain and in NL you get about 750 mm where I live now
My first year at uni it rained everyday from the 1st of September till the last day of April without fail, except for the 2 weeks it fell as snow
The Netherlands is a tropical paradise compared to Scotland
It makes me laugh when the Dutch complain about the weather
The biggest difference is the Scottish darkness, which makes any bad weather just seem worse
I will have the legal right to stay since I arrived before the 1st of January as will most Brits who live in Europe before 2021 but that's up to the country they live in
I would also qualify as a young person with a STEM background (mechanical engineering) so I was never worried I would be kicked out per say
It's more the betrayal of the British government for stripping away all these rights I have that is more disappointing
Long-term I will probably get a Dutch passport or if Scotland becomes independent and in the EU swap my British one for that
Bit of an exaggeration, weather is shite and its been shite for a while but almost every day in May was beautiful sunshine and heat
I see you're in Germany - very happy to swap
Respect and fraternal greetings to Iceland
Oh yes there are many ignorant Brits who happily swallowed down the poison by the Tories and Media including my grandparents
But I blame the ringleaders themselves much more, Bojo is the most distructive minister the UK has had in 100 years
Them twinned with the media are an atrocity on British life
They believe optics is the only thing that matters while they try to turn London into a bankers Singapore paradise while the outer lands are left to rot
"Dae a jobby"
The J word will give any scottish person a nice chuckle
Ladas are popular with some rural farmers because they are really sturdy and easy to repair
They were never particularly popular, and were often the subject of jokes for being crude and low quality
Thanks to a couple of segments on Top Gear, their reputation has been partly recovered, and they're also thought of as being rugged and durable (whilst still being the butt of jokes about dodgy cars)
Light beer isn't really a thing in England either
Was he possibly trying to translate *Helles*?
If you're not tanning a full pint of shitty lager by the time you're 14 in the UK you get your citizenship revoked
Yeah, it's the German way too and it gets on my tits
Just go, fucker, you'll be past in two seconds, which is way faster than I take to awkwardly walk-run it
I'm not sure what it's like in England, but I'm sure in Scotland the person not wearing the seatbeat also gets a fine now too
Bud light or Coors are probably the two most popular light beers in the UK
Certainly round my neck of the woods Bud Light has gained more popularity in the last year or so
It tends to be a lighter coloured than a normal beer/lager
I regularly see girls here in Manchester on Saturday nights sitting on the ground, wasted, by 10pm
Really glad you posted this 26 times
I didn’t quite get your meaning the first 25 attempts
I guessed it must have been something like that
Hahahahaha
It's cool, I'm flattered to get so many responses
Ah, good ‘ol German folktales
They never fail to bring a smile to a child, and a look of abject horror to an adult
When I was growing up it was common to be told the story of the “Old Sea Captain”.
The child is blindfolded and led upstairs into a darkened room where they get to meet the “Old Captain”. The old Captain can not speak since his tongue was cut out so the adults then tell this awful story of how he was betrayed by his first mate
They tell of his wooden leg, and let you feel the rough texture of it (a walking stick in actuality)
Then they tell of how he lost his eye gruesomely and put a marble in your hands
Eventually at the end they take your finger and out it into his “empty eye socket”. The whole time you thought it was fake but they put your finger into half of an orange
You suddenly think it’s real
This is when the kids normally scream and run away tearing at the  blindfold
Which of course makes the other kids waiting downstairs more terrified
You then have to promise not to tell
It’s all mysterious and horrifying
I was the last one to “meet” him that time
Obviously it only works once but it’s a bit of a family “rite of passage”.
Boris just coughs on everyone and wins
Definetely Bojo, he has a mean rugby tackle
*Bagpipe music hits*
Bah Gawd
Nicola Sturgeon is here to cash in money in the bank briefcase
Nicola runs her toe up the crack of Boris’ arse and goes for the pin
but no
The EU stable pummel Nicola with a steel chair
That’s sick that woman has a family dammit
EU stable members group-plex Nicola through the Spanish announce table
What’s this
Sneaky roll up pin by Liechtenstein 1
It’s a faction of allied wrestlers, like the nWo
No, go classic and give her a Churchill Crocodile
alright pal/mate is more of a greeting than a question but some people seem confused when I say it to a non Scottish person and they'll take it as a question
To an extent, given that I am from Edinburgh so my accent isn't very strong, and I don't dislike the English or support independence - which on Reddit is unusual
I’m northern English but I grew up mostly in Scotland
I’m too Scottish to be English, but too English to be Scottish at the same time
I’m also half German, so got that extra bit of foreign and I really struggle with my identity at the moment, especially with the way things are in the country at the moment
The midge:
Yes and no
I worked in Spain and loved it, the sun, wine and the festivals just made me think why the hell I'm I still in Scotland
In Spain I stick out though, 6'4, white skin and blonde and ginger beard
It's a national pastime in Scotland
The pub in Britain is a core part of our culture, on Fridays they are heaving
Alcohol consumption is not frowned upon and while there is a learning curve on drinking where younger people get drunk more often it's not uncommon to see 50+ year olds struggling to walk in the city centre on a weekend
That’s only 1 bottle of wine or less per person in a space of 4/5 hours
That would be seen as taking it easy here lol
I think the Celts would out drink the English and after that it would just be an enjoyable night out that ends with a dropped kebab and vomit in a plant pot
> (At least from French Germans Italians I know they are into moderate social drinking
Taking a walk down Dusseldorf altstadt on a Friday or a Saturday night will put to rest any notions that German people are into moderate social drinking
Why does this happen
Is it because we were outdoors more often when we were younger, or because our recollections are warped
I've heard the same thing said about loads of animals, from snails and slugs to foxes and deer
I've noticed I haven't seen any roadkill badgers for ages
but there hasn't been culling in Scotland
[And according to this article there are more now than there have been in most peoples lifetimes]
> Battered burgers
Pretty much every chippy in Scotland still does battered burgers
I wrote a long comment about the history of the Romani people and the euphemism treadmill
but really it all comes down to this
A slur not used in an insulting way is not really a slur, and the reasons the word 'gypsy' has gained negative connotations for some will not go away if we use a different word
As far as the endonym/exonym argument goes, many Romani people in the UK (where the word comes from) self-identify as gypsies
Since these groups left the Indian subcontinent a thousand years ago, their languages have remained (despite widespread attempts at suppression)
Language is not just a tool, it is our history
When we say the word gypsy, we echo hundreds of years of oppression and wonder, fear of the unknown but also curiosity and romanticism
We can choose to say this word and be mindful of all that history, just as we say the word Black or Jew or whatever
As mentioned in the article, a culprit could be more aerodynamic cars
>irrational fears
Not if you're from Rotherham hoho
In Scotland you occasionally see small ones, erected within the grounds of churches
They tend to be 'nice' in tone (e.g. Jesus loves everyone) and are there to advertise that particular church
Sometimes religious groups occasionally pay for public advertising, but it's not very widespread at all, and when it does happen, it's usually the smaller, more evangelical sects with American roots
E.g. Jehovah's witnesses
Nothing on an American scale, and nothing on the roadside, but I have seen advertising signs at railway stations in the UK saying promoting various (mostly conservative-evangelical) Christian churches and ministries
There was one, in Scotland, on the side of the M80 Highway, It said that God protects us or something
As a native [Scottish English] speaker, who has also been exposed to [Scots] I found quite a lot of familiar words in Scandinavian languages
Two Scots words that come to mind as being very Scandinavian are 'braw' (good) and 'bairn' (child)
For Glasgow: Buckfast induced football violence along vaguely religious lines
For the rest of the country: beer induced regular violence
People that care more about our union with England than our actual country
Given Glasgow's links to Ireland, added in with the fact we have a decent number of students living in the city who are Irish, there are certain pubs in the city centre that this happens in
I remember the first time I seen it and it was just so nice
It started off like 3 people playing some instruments and by the time me and my mates were moving on there was about 13 people all sitting round the table
You and us both
I think we might see a mini boom for the pubs once this is all over
Seriously, all anyone I know can talk about is how buzzing they are to go to the pub once they open back up (and I include myself in that)
It is upsetting to see establishments close because of Covid-19
But whenever I see comments about businesses closing down I’m reminded about a comment a read months ago when airlines were under strain and that was that the demand and the skill set is still going to exist once this is over
Pubs will survive
The Park Bar in Finnieston is also great for trad music on a Saturday night
It's a bit more organised than the informal sessions you get in places like the Liosmore, but it's always heaving
Fish and chips (i.e. fried battered haddock with chunky fries as some of you like to call it)
Macaroni pie
Probably fish and chips or anything else you can get from a chippy, especially a munchy box
Bridies, I think
Curry
Glasgow invented the tikki masala, 'nuff said
Probably a deep fried pizza or deep fried haggis
edit: I just forgot about fish and chips as well, but I'm not sure if that counts as much as the deep fried pizza and deep fried haggis
Or a pie
Munchybox is also a solid choice for Scotland
I'd associate munchy boxes with Indian/Doner takeways more than I'd associate them with anything else
Indians have been selling them for a lot longer
It's only really been in the last 3 years or so that Chinese's, chippys et all have jumped on the bandwagon
I'd say a roll and sausage (often with a fried egg, potato scone, black pudding or even bacon) from a burger van/roll shop are just as popular, if not more popular, than pies
The list is endless in Scotland let’s be honest man
For me a good snack on the go, so falls under fast food for me
Aye but I wouldn't say that indian places are our national fast food, idk if that makes sense
You see a large mix of Scotland and UK flags here
Much much less than the US, but much more than in England for example
Nah we're very patriotic
See a fair deal of Scottish and UK flags depending on which area you live in
Sometimes you see those cringe Scotland/EU ones too, and our Royak Standard, both tend to be indicators of political affiliations
Here flying either the union jack or a saltire is more a statement of your political intent (union or independence) so its not uncommon but quite rare
Not really
If anything, scottish flags have gotten more popular
Having one is relatively normal, having clothing with a Scottish flag on it somewhere is extremely common
Displaying one isn't weird but it's slightly unusual, I wouldn't think anything particular or someone displaying one
Generally the most common time you see them displayed is in pubs but you also see them on public buildings, at sporting events, on or in churches and in protests
My area exclusively has Scottish flags, both of them, ‘cause it’s a really pro independence area
They’re also spray painted everywhere and there’s yes stickers on pretty much every lamppost
Yeah and it depends on where you are too
I see more Scottish and European flags but I guess in a unionist area there might be more Uk flags
I’d say there’s more flag flying in general in Glasgow than anywhere else
It’s still definitely not a common thing
Maybe not the most famous but this photo called [‘children of the gorbals’] is a very famous photo in Scotland
It shows children out playing in the Slums of the Gorbals in Scotland in the late 50s, the city was so called the ‘2nd city of the empire’ but yet a majority of its population didn’t have bathroom access up until the 1970s with entire families living in single roomed Victorian slums
As much as the conditions were slum like the areas had high community spirit, something that was stomped out of Glasgow after the demolition of the tenements and construction of the tower blocks which caused social problems and high crime rates due to the lack of jobs or community centres that were built with them
The city council cared more about housing people than making good areas to live something that to this day has had the affect of having some areas in Glasgow have average life expectancy as low as 3rd world countries
The photo reminds people of a simpler time when life was tough but people for the most part were happy having good neighbours and a strong community, something that Glasgow needs more of
I left the UK in 2013 (good move) and came back in 2020 (what a mistake)
I'm amazed that salaries have not increased, but costs certainly have
The squeeze on living standards over the last decade is real - and it needs to stop
One thing I’ve always found odd any time I’ve been to Germany in the last few years is that the staff in the bars tend to wear little pouches where the keep money
I’ve never seen that happen in any other country:
Granted I’ve only been to central Amsterdam twice, but I never noticed a litter problem there
I fully appreciate that’s where the tourists go though so they might make more of an effort to keep it clean and that it could well be a lot worse outside of that area
That being said, West Central Scotland has a disgusting problem with litter
It really is something I find shameful about living here
My god that is grim
You'd fit well in Scotland too
The only time of proper peace between me and my southern friends has been the last 300 years
before that was nasty
This is why I voted to remain in the European Union - not the only reason, but certainly one of the main reasons
In the UK we still tend to talk about our weight in terms of stone which is equivalent to 14 pounds
It’s a bit old fashioned but widely used
For example, I’m a nurse and if I take a weight in kg my patients will always shake their heads, saying they don’t know what that means and asking me to convert into stones
A "bawhair"* is usually used to define a distance that is really small
Eg: That car just missed hitting me by a bawhair
&nbsp;
*Bawhair = Pube
We have the gill and the dram, which are traditional measures for spirits, mainly whisky
And of course we have our own cultural relative units
For large areas that would usually be Wales ("an area 3 times the size of Wales"), and for money it's the price of a Celtic season ticket
That's odd because I'm young and only know my weight in kilograms
Interesting
I know my weight in kilograms but not in stones
Yes, I’d agree with that
It seems odd when Americans talk of weighing hundreds of pounds
Yeah, I literally said it was old fashioned
We have a ridiculous hybrid system when it comes to measurements
I just wish we’d commit and go full on metric but I imagine nowadays that would be seen as far too European
Most of the early railways were built by canal engineers, so a lot of the terminology would have crossed over
Couldn’t agree more
I mean, I’d rather we used kg if honest but the idea often portrayed here, as you point out, just isn’t true
As a nurse in an outpatient clinic, it’s really rather rare for me to come across someone comfortable with kg
Divide your weight in pounds by 14
You now know your weight in stones
Europe has a rich history, there are natural and man made wonders but I think we also have to split man made wonders into ancient and modern, that creates a new perspective on it I think
Went last October to see QUB with me madre and went on a lil N.I day tour and it's actually such a fun wee trip out
Salt mine is class
I think he means like, cultural wonder
I don't think he's saying it's good but he's saying its important to visit
Hope not anyway
No but the point being is its an incredible place to visit
Is what he's saying a wonder is your right normally a good thing but it's of huge cultural significance
It's cultural history in a way because that's a part of history
That was Nazi culture
No, I know I'm explaining it the way he said it
It's culturally significant to the history of Jewish people and nazism and WW2
Don't be rude to me just because you disagree
I'm just trying to explain what the original poster meant
It is a culturally significant place, I'm sorry you disagree
I was annoyed at Gaelic and my father's attempts to teach it to me growing up
I saw it as a distraction and mostly an irrelevance to a kid growing up in a council flat in a big city
These days it's become extremely important to me and I wish I had learned it as a child so I wouldn't have to spend at much time working on it today
Mountains and twisty roads
Used to hate them because they made me feel sick but now they're kind of nice lol
I feel it's become a bigger part of Scottish identity than when I was a kid in the 90s when it was mostly seen as a rural thing spoken by incestuous religious zealots but what with devolution and the end of the decline of the language as well as government policies to promote it
It's also gotten a lot more international recognition as a part of Scotland in movies, books and TV shows
I think today a lot more people know a bit of Gaelic than 20 years ago but rates of fluency are still around 1 to 1
5%.
Tha mi gu math, tha mi ochd bliadhna fichead a dh aois
Gur math a theid leat
Aye though it's a lot more spoken in Ireland with your schooling system and stuff
In a perfect world I'd hope that Scotland adapts a Gaelic teaching system similar to Ireland in the next 20 years
Chan eil mi fileanta ann am Gàidhlig ach tha mo Gàidhlig math
Aye, luckily the terminal decline Gaelic had been going through from 1746 to 2000 has been at least somewhat stopped now and numbers have remained a little bit more stable these last 20 years than the 250 years before said they should be
Chan eil an-diugh, duilich
Chanainn "feabhas".
Oh well, sigh
But Ireland still has a system where pretty much everyone has some knowledge of Irish
I think it could be fairly quickly turned around though
I mean I think the political will to educate all children in a degree of Gaelic would not be too hard to manufacture especially with the current Scottish political situation
We already turned around Scots from a dying language/dialect to a commonly understood one in a similar way
Nah there's absolutely no option for it in probably 95% of schools
Even schools in Gaelic speaking areas sometimes don't offer it
This is the legacy of a long term policy of the British government, reversed in 2005 to try and promote English over Gaelic
I mean I'd be good if it was offered as a choice subject or even just lessons that didn't make up a grade where everyone got an hour a week of Gaelic lessons or something
I mean the SNP is generally pro-Gaelic though I worry a lot of their idea of it is using it as a nationalistic token to make Scotland more distinct than it already is
I think if it begins to really die again though they'll take some action to preserve it, assuming that is that their national level politicans don't go on incoherent rants about how Gaelic is islamophobic again
I think due to the geographic isolation of the western isles Gaelic will survive as a community language indefinitely especially on the southern isles of the outer Hebrides
I think it's time as a community language on the small section of the mainland where it remains is numbered though
&#x200B;
Oh yeah it wasn't even that it was associated with right wing nationalism, luckily we've been able to avoid most of that
What is was called islamophobic for was that it was taking away money from promoting the use of Urdu among the Pakistani community in Glasgow
Wait where did you get those statistics
What I've seen seems to suggest that it is stabalising significantly relative to the last 100 years
Aye Skye is likely lost but that's the inner Hebrides
I really don't think South Uist will be non Gaelic speaking within my lifetime
Tha Dia air a bhith cuideachail
Tro Dia tha e comasach
Max Burger from Sweden, since I first went there no other burger chain matters to me
Any Curry Wurst chain please open up in Scotland please and thank you
Not a brand but when I was in Ios in Greece several years back they had they had the most amazing vegetarian gyros
Hot flatbread with chips, fresh tzatziki and salad for €1
We need something like that here
Lol still have my Hotmail account too
Yeah but it's not called hotmail any more
It's outlook now
They obviously mean for personal use
Because they're talking about personal email addresses, not business one
They mention tech illiterate users with hotmail and their mum, why would you assume they're talking about business domains
Scotland:
England obviously, most of our history is about our relationship with them
France the auld alliance, helped us counter England
Ireland our Celtic brothers and share similar relationship with England
Norway some Vikings came over and were difficult to remove
5 a little less clear, maybe Netherlands and bringing over Protestantism
Or another Scandinavian country
We didn't really have a issue with Spain like England or were involved with continental affairs like with the HRE until the union of the crowns
Or I suppose Italy if you include the Romans
The country that has had the most historical influence in Scotland, outside the British Isles, is France, without any doubt
England
France
Lowlands (Benelux)
Jamaica
Norway
- England (obviously)
- France (the Auld Alliance)
- Ireland (Ulster Scots)
- Germany (World Wars)
- India (empire)
Honorable mentions
- The Baltic nations for pre-empire trade
- Italy for the Romans and recent immigration
- Panama for the Darien Scheme
- Canada for emigration during and after the clearances
- Poland for post-war immagration
For Scotland probably:
1: England
2: France
3: Canada
4: Ireland
5: Norway
England
Ireland
Er the scandiva countries
Rome/Italy
Gemany
I'd put Germany over Norway, and I say this as someone whose family is literally from Orkney (where the Norwegians settled)
The Protestant Reformation had a huge impact on the course of our history, so Martin Luther kickstarting that is a big deal (even though we are technically Calvinists rather than Lutherans)
> The USA are important because from the 18th century on they have been the prime destination for emigrants from Germany and to this day they are transfigured as a sort of holy land (subconsciously, I think Winnetou novels and cowboy movies also contributed to that motion)
I have noticed that Germans pay a lot more attention to the USA than other (non-Anglophone) countries seem to
I browse /r/france and /r/de, and whereas /r/france largely ignores the Americans, I see US related posts on /r/de more frequently
I guess it's too limited of a sample size to really draw any conclusions, but it feels like the French actively try to avoid "American issues", while Germans actively discuss American matters
Granted, these days 90% of US related topics on /r/de are very negative and basically boil down to "why are Americans stupid
" But it feels like Germans genuinely want this question answered, whereas the French will just say it for laughs and then move on
I think that's probably because you were the bigger partner and had "bigger fish to fry". An alliance with a relatively small country in Europe particularly one not on the mainland I can imagine is easily looked over when you are studying the 100 year war etc
I know I live in Netherlands, I meant another Scandinavian country refering to number 4 Norway
IMO the issue is that we affected their history, but they didn't necessarily affect us in an equal manner
The Scottish diaspora in Zimbabwe certainly left its mark (Ian Smith was from a Scottish family I think
), but Zimbabwe's influence on Scotland is minimal
It's a bit like how Spain is a huge influence on a country like Honduras, but Honduras is not a huge influence on Spain
That's maybe a fairer suggestion, I think dispora is probably best fit although a bit of a cheat
It is telling though that there is approximately 5 million Scots in Scotland but anywhere between 30 and 40 million people worldwide with Scottish lineage
I think Canada has a higher proportion though (correct me if I'm wrong)
> The US are also a major topic in school
Students spend about two years learning about the us (if you combine all subjects)
That's more than about every other country, except Germany
That's surprising
I thought you'd learn more about France or another European country more
Salty cos u keep losing
I think it’s the nature of this sub
Most people on here have a strong connection to a European identity, which is why they are here
I think a good comparison of how different attitudes are on here to the general population is a poll that was done recently on this sub asking things on the line of “would you like to see a United European state”, with the results in the region of 70-90% yes
Irl the highest these polls ever get in any European country is 30%
If you want no culture and speaking English all the time, why not just emigrate to America
I support Ireland cos Irish people have better patter than England
When we go independent I’ll support Scotland, but right now Ireland, cos they’re just as mental as us
I get that
That’s part of the reason I put “Scotland” as my flair instead of “United Kingdom”. People on this sub seem to know that Scotland didn’t vote for brexit, so there’s no real shame for me
I mean, I *also* support Scottish independence and identity much more as Scottish than I do British, so I probably would’ve put Scotland regardless, but the brexit thing was a factor
Your everything wrong with Scottish Independence
They’re everywhere here
Oh, so this is where the "John Paul rapes children" meme comes from
My Polish friends keep spamming this shit on our group chats at fucking 4 in the morning
This thread is so enlightening
My Polish friends are always spamming pictures of ballsack nosed monkeys and "John Paul rapes children" at silly o' clock hours in our group chats, now I finally understand what they all mean
r/de has that too
but for Wednesday, rather than Friday
> Oh, and the "silly hour", when most cenzopapas are posted, is 21:37, an hour when John Paul II died
Fucking hell, this really does explain everything hahaha
That "Neptune's Kiss" illustration is a thing of wonder, beauty and horror
Its definetely England
We ALWAYS bicker and fight, but in the end we are so similar
Behind all the jokes theres a legitimate fondness
Besides, making fun of the English is our thing
We can do it all day, but if anyone else tries it you'll be told where to go
It's England
Because you can choose your friends, but you're stuck with your brothers
I think it depends on who's closest
For me personally it's the Netherlands
I love you guys
I'll always love you
You also got the best plants <3
I’d have to say Ireland, both North and South
Some people are saying England but let’s not forget, Scotia wasn’t originally England, it was Ireland
Same sports (Hurling and Shinty), same drinks (Whisky and Whiskey), we both like St Columba (Colm Cille), same language (Gàidhlig agus Gaelige), same stupid response from Americans and English people [(case in point)] when we speak English, and we are both big fans of the Bucky, although for some reason Irish people have it in brown bottles
Wales and Scotland, we both hate England in our own ways
Ireland, France
Just historical, plus recent events have highlighted there's a lot we have in common
Ireland, those guys have similar culture, are the same   type of people, celts
And we have close ties
And both hate the English,  heh
When Scotland faced Ireland in the Euros 2016 qualifiers away, the song went [‘We hate England, we hate England, we hate England more than you, we hate England more than you’]
Most of us dont want independence, it's just a loud vocal minority that whinge about that
The kind of people that think Braveheart was a documentary
You're alright by us, except maybe London
And at least you're not French at any rate
Ireland would be Scotland's friend, England our brother
After all, you can choose your friends
Northern Ireland is Scotlands child for sure
We share lots of cultural ties and similarities
Due to sectarianism being ever present in our western communities Ireland wouldnt be a safe pick
It probably should surprise you as, frankly, they're incorrect
There's a reason all the recent polls about Independence largely sit relatively close to 50/50 and it's not that one side of it is just an online vocal minority
Also the whole comment about Braveheart was probably a pretty good way to tell they're not actually discussing this in good faith
I say this as someone who voted No in 2014
They have a strong online presence, but the statistics speak for themselves
I'm confused, what statistics are those
As far as I'm aware it's still pretty much 50/50
Personally I'm all for independence and so are many people I know
It's definitely not just a whinging minority haha
As you'll be aware 55-45 was the referendum result, with polls showing a decrease in favour of independence since
There was an artificial rise after brexit but it quickly dissipated again
Got some bad news for you pal
I dont think you do tbh
Oh I do, it's good news for Scotland though - you'll surely agree
TIL German doesn't discriminate between Gorillas and Guerillas when it comes to warfare
I have been misled by the copypasta
Everyone gathering around the Bride & Groom at the end of the night and singing 'The Bonnie Banks o' Loch Lomond'. Always a quality moment
Get rid of those pesky red bits and those horizontal and vertical sections and it would be perfect

Yes that’s what I mean, remove the horizontal and vertical lines and keep the diagonals :)
Northern Ireland-
Narrator- It wasn’t a better idea
Edit states that in Romania, if you have a job you are expected to help with expenses
This is exactly the same as what happens in the UK
No one calls it ‘rent’. It’s not a financial obligation
We calling it ‘paying digs’ and it’s just helping with household expenditure
It’s normally people who have a job and aren’t in education but still live with parents
People at uni or college usually won’t pay digs
I paid my patents £100 a month when I started a full time job
If I was ever in trouble they would of course help me out and wouldn’t take the money
I’m British, and I’ve never heard of this happening around here
It's not called rent, but many parents here start charging what we call "dig money" when their kids start earning a full time wage (mostly after they turn 18) and they are still living at home
Each family does different things with that money
Mine, for example, put it towards the grocery shopping and some household bills
It tends to be seen more as a contribution to the running of the household rather than charging them to live there
Me ans my parents agreed I'd pay 'rent' for the year between school and uni when I was working, largely because that year they were losing the income of Child Tax Credit (or w/e its called) from me and my twin brother, and were sort of hard up continuing to support even just having me stay around
It was very cheap (£100 or so a month, plus any fuel for rides into work, which I avoided by cycling) and didn't even attempt to try and replace the credit or living costs, but it just helped to keep things ticking over
In the latter half of uni (so the last two years) they've helped me out when I got worried about money with a hundred a month
So it works out and is just putting money where its needed most at that moment to keep us all going
I'm curious how many get charged an actual full rent versus how many get a cheap 'rent' which is basically just a small contribution to shared living costs
None of your mates ever spoke about their parents taking dig money off them
Well I think there’s a difference between paying a landlord rent which has been defined in a legal contract opposed to giving your mum and dad a bit of money to pay towards your share of expenses
In Scotland we make that distinction
It's what my family called it
Up here every I know calls it dig money/digs
Jesus, that’s harsh
You could have rented your own place for that lol
Eh, my family didn't. Nor did several of my friends families
It was just called paying rent, even though there was no legal contract or comparable cost to me
Some people some places use some different words
S'fine
Huh, well there you go
Could be a regional thing
Maybe
I've heard it referred to as board and rent, so I really think it just differs from person to person and the dialects/people they interact with
Who knows, all three are correct in my books
I don’t think so
There’s a cat at Downing Street in London where the Prime Minister lives
I really wish there was some kind of movement to just redo the spelling of the English language because it’s so fucking stupid and inconsistent
A recently heard someone say that the Dutch are just Germans who drink tequila
I don’t know if you actually wanted an answer to this or not but here it is
The r in “particular” isn’t silent, but most English accents don’t fully articulate an R if it comes after a vowel
I don’t know why they do that, but it is just an accent thing
I would like to give a big thanks to France for the many times we have aided each other on the battlefield

I'm just gonna thank Malta for being extremely kind, helpful, friendly place to a visiting Scot
Especially the two short known Maltese friends who took time off work to show me the sights: I would never have been able to see as much of that country and loved it as much as I now do without the insane amount of additional, unasked for labour they undertook
Cheers, you wonderful little island
France, for all the historical alliances against England
Also Croatia because I'm getting married there next year
poland for nice people and tasty food and drink
Italy for pizza, France for beer, Spain for seafood and Russia for the song *dash cam*.
A personal thank you to Germany, for hosting my internship and Erasmus, giving me a taste foot personal independence and living abroad
I'd also like to thank the Poles for helping defend the UK during the Battle of Britain
I know they were *really* fighting to win their homeland back, but many laid down their lives and in doing so helped protect our civilians and infrastructure
I also choose France
For the above reasons, plus also for still being hot in September
Had a nice craft beer from France once
Best seafood I ever had was in a traditional restaurant in Spain

And who the fuck is a flower to call me oot ? It's flooer ya donkey
Nae bawhair mate
No because a lot of Scots speak English with lots of Scots language mixed in so it’s a bit more than just colloquialisms
So writing in standard English sometimes just doesn’t convey the message or what is being said
You'd be a funny cunt in person but i bet you feel gie castrated online without the accent carrying it
american politics for some reason, at least in my household anyway
The news paper my great auntie gets is absolutely plastered with american news to the point she talks about it like we're voting for our own prime minister
Except it wasn't a true and full ban (if its rape, you can have an abortion), because that would mean it breaks human rights
All you can do is hope that PiS blocks people from leaving the country to have abortions and then you can bring the case to the ECHR
> Feminine hygiene products not being classed as essential is the even more controversial issue
They are, Tesco fucked up
[Welsh Government put a statement out about it] anything sold in a pharmacy is considered essential
Yup I remember when PiS took over the courts making the country extremely undemocratic without an independent Judiciary
Surprised it took so long for something like this to happen
And the EU can do nothing about it
Human rights are outside their jurisdiction, the updated Constitution technically keeps to human rights anyways, and anything the EU do to prevent PiS' takeover is vetoed and blocked by Hungary
Now it does, yes
It was tied between Ireland and Poland with the UK close behind
But since Ireland made it completely legal and Poland did this
Poland is by far the strictest with the UK second behind
Lukcily leaving the EU is different to the Council of Europe and we have to keep human rights because I know if that were the case and the wrong people were elected in this country, you'd see a complete ban in the UK
Honestly
I hope she advocates more
It might make PiS slip up and ban abortion outright which would bring the ECHR down to bear on Poland
Breaking human rights isn't cheap, and it might make PiS finally realise how much of an economic benefit being in the EU is
Don't watch mainstream BBC because
Well
Tory mouthpiece
But I'm studying human rights at the moment and our lecturer is keeping us up to date with everything going on in Poland
That and my gf keeps me up to date since she's Polish herself
EU can't do anything but ECHR can
ECHR isn't part of the EU, it's part of the Council of Europe which every European country has signed accepting human rights
Even Russia and (I think) Turkey are on the list so you know its definitely not the EU
If Poland go full blown ban on abortion even if there was rape, there's precedent in an Irish case that the ECHR will place heavy fines on the country until the ban is lifted
After that case and another where women were blocked from leaving the country to get abortions in less strict countries and that was also found to be in breach of human rights, Ireland became one of the most liberal countries in Europe for abortions
For the UK it's Oxford and Cambridge, in Scotland it's between Edinburgh, St Andrews and Glasgow
All are very difficult to get into, Oxbridge is crazy though
I personally didn't like the culture round them, too much formality
Beautiful campuses though
In Scotland I’d say theres a couple
People like to portray St Andrews at the top but if I’m being honest all the ancient ones are equal like Glasgow or edinburgh
The only ones I’d say aren’t prestigious are modern ones like the University of the West of Scotland (the reason for the big name is that it isn’t very attractive to students if the name is University of Paisley)
It depends who you ask, but one of Glasgow, Edinburgh or St
Andrews
Andrews is the most traditional, and eschews all technical subjects, so the people who care about that would probably say it's the most prestigious
For law in Scotland, I think it's actually Strathclyde uni
Glasgow Uni is probably one of the most prestigious overall but it's supposed to be shite for law
For Scotland I would definitely say that St Andrews is top, while Glasgow and Edinburgh follow closely behind in joint second
Yeah St Andrews for me
Plus i think of it as an extension of English Unis
Yeah unfortunately in Britain there is so much inbuilt class issues with education that they don't actually look at the content or ranking it's just a wink wink nudge nudge you went to my uni you get the job
There is definitely a different set of rules for the high paying Asians compared to the rest of us
It's a real shame to be honest, I remember having some in group projects and they certainly weren't on the same level as us
I needed AAAAB to get into my course but no way those students were getting that
My professor described them as computers they needed to basically be scripted on what to do and couldn't think for themselves, no creativity or perseverance on it if they haven't been walked through it already
Unfortunately there is a funding crisis in unis in UK and this is an "easy solve" for the unis to make up the pay gap
They often also don't interact much with the wider uni community and ostracized themselves
They basically attend different unis to the rest of us
The only good thing has been an uptake in better Asian food places in the west end
St Andrews is good for things like theology etc but doesn't do nearly as wide a range of subjects as the other 2
Edinburgh and Glasgow have very rich histories and are both top notch unis and are better at some subjects
To compare world rankings as an example in the QS rankings, St Andrews is 92nd this year Glasgow 77th and Edinburgh 20th putting Edinburgh above big US unis like John Hopkins and only 3 below Yale
For law possibly but in general I think Edinburgh has a much more prestigious history and is higher in the rankings than St Andrews
St Andrews doesn't do all the STEM subjects so I always forget about it
St Andrews I think has the reputation recently because of Prince William but Edinburgh also has a shit ton of English and international students
An extension of English unis, or an extension of the English public school system
I just feel like there’s a lot of posh English folk at St Andrews (also like your username)
Yeah I have friends that went to Oxbridge and went to the dinners etc
I was horrified and how incestuous some of it was
There is obviously many who are just smart kids but there's a whole subsection where daddy is the ambassador to Nigeria and Uncle John is head of a division at Goldman's.
> I guess my own country is quite underwhelming from a tourist perspective
I don't know
I went on holiday to Slovakia and loved it - I spent about ten days just travelling around, exploring the country, visiting castles, walking, enjoying the food and the beer and wine
I thought it was a great place to visit
I've travelled quite a bit in that part of the world - I've visited Poland three times (to Krakow, Warsaw and the north coast), Hungary and Romania (Transylvania), and Ukraine - and I think of all of them Slovakia was the one I enjoyed most
Then again, I just love that central European Hapsburg vibe - the food, the landscapes etc
BiH is great to visit, it's got a mix of cultures, great food, interesting history, varied architecture and some very pretty nature
Vilnius is the G spot of Europe though, worth paying attention to
Same here, losing the "well" kinda makes it better but still sounds cunty
I noticed this when I moved to the US from Scotland
It somehow felt like everyone was being rude to me and I could quite figure out why
In the UK, some older generations would say “it’s the dog’s bollocks” meaning it’s good
What tf is possibly good about dog’s bollocks
Be fine most of the time, tbh
Tone really matters more/most in these cases
Depends on the company, I suppose, ultimately
It's kinda part of the fun but I don't think I'd want anyone calling me darling or honey anyways, that's a bit of an English thing,those two anyway, unless I was in a relationship with the person
It's all in the wording and so long as you're fairly polite here we won't mind you
Haha, that’s amazing
I didn’t know there were so many distinct dialects, although admittedly I’m picking up on many now that I live in the US
Oh honey, dont be like that
Edit: fuck me nah
Dont like that
It's very much a context thing and also depends on the person, some can definitely somehow get away with it, if I use darling it just sounds odd to come out of my mouth
Yeah they're usually used for people you know but not always, very location dependant as to the degree to which it sounds odd
I don't think there is many corrupt politicians in Scotland
Micro-corruption (bribes to police officers to waive fines, bribes to officials to speed the processing of documents, bribes to judges to decide a case) is almost non-existent
Macro-corruption (campaign donations to influence policy decisions and government contracts in favour of particular interests) is rife
It certainly isn't a problem in daily life I suppose but when every public infrastructure, health and community project seems to end up costing 3x the original budgets you start to get suspicious
Apart from Police Scotland (which is a good police force in many ways however has and still deals with problems of corruption
) most of the country is very transparent
We're more corrupt than most people here probably like to think but overall still not that corrupt
*An Eala Bhan* (The White Swan), is a poem set to music, telling of a soldier's love for his betrothed and his longing to return home to her, and peace
Sadly, real-life is invariably less romantic than poetry, for whilst the author did return safely, she married someone else
- not sure how you make hyperlinks say something else but this alestorm song is the peak of Scottish music
"Hector the Hero" always tugs at my heart
Nothing except a choir can beat the bagpipes, when it comes to conveying emotion (in my opinion)
It was composed in honour of a real soldier, Hector MacDonald, who committed suicide after slanderous accusations against them ruined his reputation and his life
Hector enlisted in the army as a lowly private, at the age of 17, and rose through the ranks to become a Major General, a rare example of pure merit carrying good soldiers into the higher ranks
I think that was the first single I ever bought
I used to know every word
TIL Gustav Holst was British
This whole time I thought he was Swedish, wtf
But I do love Jupiter, and imo, "I vow to thee my country" would be a far better national anthem than God save the Queen
I’m not sure what constitutes a ‘larger city’ but I’ll assume Edinburgh counts
So I live in Edinburgh, Scotland
It’s the capital of Scotland and home to our parliament which is opposite a royal palace and both are adjacent to a park which has an extinct volcano in the middle called Arthur’s Seat
Edinburgh is the second largest city in Scotland with Glasgow the largest, both have quite a different feel though
Edinburgh is a very historic city with a wealth of beautiful architecture
In many areas it is very affluent but like all cities, has areas of deprivation
It’s reasonably multicultural for its size and is popular with European migrants, especially from Spain and Eastern Europe
We have four universities so have a large student population
Life is good here, many people use public transport as we have a good network of buses and slowly growing tram network
Downsides include high property prices and the weather
We are definitely on the small scale in terms of being a city, but that's kind of a good thing in its own way
The climate/ weather is not even that bad imo
It doesn't rain *that* much and who wants to be hot anyway
Haha
Brilliant
And it’s true, the difference in rainfall between east and west is crazy
We may not get the higher temps they do south of the border but it’s sunny on the east coast
in fact, Dundee is the sunniest city in Scotland
Yeah, I agree
Our weather is ok
I wish we were guaranteed a better summer but we rarely have weather extremes in winter or summer
The beast from the east was something else
Finally putting enough funding in to crack efficient fusion power
It’s sad that fusion could have been possibly obtained decades ago but the funding just isn’t there
Relatively infinite, green power forever
We would never run out of fuel
The patents attributed to the continent and distributed would pay for themselves within years and pretty much advance human civilisation in every possible way
I feel like draining the entire north and Baltic Sea would have a huge impact on sea level
I can’t say I would be against a legalisation, safe production and safe consumption of all narcotics available where possible, but it’s not my *first* goal for the world
Didn’t the Russians literally annex Crimea for access to ports
For the UK, we have a short list (mostly because six of the UK's monarchs have been called George and the country isn't that old) -
Anne, George, William, Victoria, Edward and Elizabeth
For Scotland we have a considerably longer list
I've included all names where there were multiple claimants to the throne -
Kenneth, Donald, Constantine, Aed, Giric, Eochaid, Malcolm, Indulf, Dubh, Cuilen, Amlaib, Duncan, Macbeth, Lulach, Edgar, Alexander, David, William, Margaret, John, Robert, Edward, James, Mary, Charles and Anne
> Amlaib
Was he a Norse king
I've seen the modern surname MacAulay as an anglicised *Mac Amhlaibh*, which is the Gaelic cognate of *Olafson*.
It does
I agree that Black is an odd name
It may not actually have been his name - there's so little contemporary material that we know little about him
It may have been a negative nickname about his character, a reference to the colour of his hair or possibly even of his skin
He's also referred to as Dén or 'Vehement' in another source
MacBeth was actually quite a good King
Shame about the play
He and his father Indulf both have Old Norse names but weren’t Norse - both were Gaels
There’s not a great deal of information left, but his grandfather Constantine II probably married the daughter of Eadwulf II of Northumbria, who was definitely Norse
Constantine II was also an ally of Olaf Guthfrifthson, King of Dublin
The names probably come from the family connection to other Norse royalty
Henry and Richard were names used by the English Monarchy, but not the Scottish
There haven't been any Henrys or Richards since the UK was formed
Both Charles I and Charles II were King of Scotland and King of England
The thrones were in union, but the countries were separate at the time
Mary I of England (Bloody Mary) and Mary I of Scotland (Mary, Queen of Scots) ruled at the same time but were (obviously) different people
Mary II was Queen of both Scotland and of England, but again this was while the countries were separate
Thanks for that, that's interesting
Scotland's early history as a nation is definitely something I need to do more reading on
She teaches Spanish in the UK
French
French opens up half of Africa
For a lot of jobs in aid, trade, development, infrastructure and technology, international organisations, diplomacy, conflict resolution, military etc etc French is a really useful language
In Scotland it’s whether you have [chippy sauce or ketchup] on your Fish and Chips
It’s actually a *literal* divide on the East/West coasts
I'm led to believe that a good chunk of that lot are of Scottish descent from the Plantation and all that
No one over here, regardless of denomination, keeps their toaster in the cupboard, so I've no idea where they've got that weird-arse habit from
(I'm aware the colonisation pre-dates toasters of course
Technically (and legally) a cake but eaten like a biscuit
The overlapping bit of the venn diagram
even though it's got cake in the name it's not a cake or a biscuit, it's just a jaffa cake
I chop and change, occasionally coming out with some bastardised sound somewhere in between (have I accidentally invented a vowel
I reckon I favour "gone" though
Milk Second
Barry's
Aye, I'm quite hungry just now actually
I'll skip this one to avoid an international incident but your soda bread stuff is nice
Tayto
Specifically Republic Tayto rather than North Tayto
There was this guy from Glasgow complaining to Trading Standards a few years back about how a chippie charged for tomato sauce
The guy claimed it was "racial discrimination"!
The best part of the court case is they baked a massive normal-cake-sized jaffa cake to prove a point
I fucking love studying law sometimes
I had no idea there was a Bavarian wikipedia
Learning German in school we only learned Brötchen
Supper's a different meal altogether in Scotland (unless you're at the chippie, then it's another kettle of fish)
I actually took that picture from an article about that debacle since it showed both sauces
What a fucking nutter
Obviously he shouldn’t have asked for tomato sauce at all; chippy sauce is king
(I admit though that putting chips with chippy sauce in a buttered roll with a little bit of tomato sauce/ketchup on top of them as well is kind of amazing)
Oh no I really hope my accent and pronunciation has gotten worse than it used to be because I still can't speak German well to save my life and I don't want to *sound* like someone who should be able to
A light meal later on in the evening a wee bit before bed, after you've had your tea/dinner
I only found out recently that this isn't a thing elsewhere in the English speaking world
At the chippy it's just x-with chips, so a fish supper is fish and chips, sausage supper is sausage and chips etc
"Do you know Davey McCall from Aberdeen

Tall guy, blonde hair
Aye, I know him
Some are undying enemies of a friend, for reasons that make no sense to anyone - including the people involved, but the grudge shall be held for eternity
Scotland, however, is not
Especially as a lot of it is empty, and our population is largely confined to a relatively small area
We do, we do mainly Scottish & UK stuff, some about Ireland and a lot about the US and the rest of Europe
When I was in school, we spent a whole year in history learning about the potato famine
I'm not sure if they do in England though
Not even America
It's definitely not just a Scottish thing, but I think it's probably more of a small town thing than a small country thing
More like on and off with some other topics lol
Nah, it only counts if my great-grandad said that to your great-grandad
In my 4th year of high school, I chose to study history for that year
We mostly learned about the causes and consequences of it, and then also the immigration that took place afterwards
One Scottish Gàidhlig word (dont think its used commonly though) is sùil-thòine which means eye-arse or eye-of-the-arse
And I think, personally, that eye-of-the-arse is a good enough translation for arsehole
To summarise, in gàidhlig cuttlefish are erseholes
im gonna say 500 miles (along with many other proclaimers songs) and ig lewis capaldi did pretty well with someone you loved
If I never hear 500 miles again then that's just fine by me
for scotland in particular id say anything by calvin harris, its mostly just mediocre drum&bass and remixes
Probably that dance monkey by Tones and I, That shite went on for about 4-5 months constantly on the radio
[I'm Gonna Be (500 miles)] is so clearly the right answer for us
No fucking way mate
The answer for this is clear and obvious
Mediocre song that achieved global fame to an unprecedented degree
[When I wake up
Well I know I'm gonna be
Fucking love The Proclaimers though
Persevere is a fantastic album
I have never heard of this
I thought you meant [Flat Eric]
Yes, I'm old
for sure
Of all the proclaimers songs, this is the only one I can't fucking stand
I HAVE NO IDEA HOW THE FUCK I FORGOT ABT THE PROCLAIMERS i take what i said back
It was played on forth 1 and radio one constantly probably the with Clyde 1 as well
Nah, plenty of us love the song
It is overplayed though and regarded as cheesy, definitely easy to see why some people now hate it
Edinburgh Trams - asking someone if they like them is a great way of finding out if they're from the city
Siemens were also involved in the disastrous [Edinburgh Tram Project]  By most accounts the trams are now a good thing for the city but the building of them was an absolute shambles and they only got completed due to sunk costs
Edinburgh at the start of the project had one of the best bus systems I've ever used and trams were an unnecessary disruption
My favourite part of the projects failings was when track had to be relaid because snow/cold damaged it
We don’t have ID cards here either
Closest we have is our driving licence
There is a national ID card you just need to apply for it
Yeah, I went into Sainsbury's a few days ago with my dad and the only empty shelves were the soaps and all that
Some woman even tried to buy literally every hand sanitizer they had but obviously they didn't let her do that
I'm fairly certain she was planning on selling it on Ebay or something for a higher price since it's probably gonna be relatively hard finding soap now
> Similarly, freedom
Saoirse
Seer-sha
Saorsa in Scottish Gaelic, kind of like soor-sa/soor-sha
Always interesting to see how it changed in the crossing and the millenia and more apart
I need to keep reminding myself that you guys don't tend to pronounce the final 'r' down south, really threw me comparing Celador to 'cellar door' initially
Same
"Sella daw" to them it would seem
Ah, that's interesting
That sort of rain is known as *smirr* in Scots, which almost sounds as if it could be related to the Basque word
Scots / Gàidhlig names are pretty cool for the most part
From William to Struan, most of them sound strong and cool
Sholto (dunno that I spelled it right but thats how it sounds) is horrendous
Dörte, definitely Dörte
I love old Saxon names in English
Penicillin
“We” invented a fuck ton of other useful stuff as well, but I think penicillin was probably the most important
Probably biggest one is the telephone or television, but there’s honestly so much more
Especially things we use on a daily basis
Penicillin, the MRI, refrigerators, Toaster, contact lenses, syringes, steam engines, etc
Top ones are probably the steam engine, penicillin, the telephone, TV, bikes, football (fuck off England we invented it) but I would still have to go for Irn Bru
Depends if talking about Scotland telephone maybe
Tons of other things too, if talking about the UK & NI tons literally tons
I wouldn't know where to begin
The Steam Engine that fuelled the Industrial Revolution was actually invented by James Watt
he did improve upon earlier designs made by an Englishman I'll give you that
And golf
Steam engine was English according to Wikipedia
[No it isn’t ]
Like everything in the UK we half arsed it and called it job done lol
I was just thinking that
James Watt mate
Same with passing in Football and Andy Murray always trying to claim our shit
He discovered insulin, not penicillin
Those are two very different things
When Covids over go to the Hampden museum, all the evidence is there
Look up newspapers of when Andy Murray wins and loses, you'll see a pattern
Look at this cunt
Imagine actually posting in r/badunitedkingdom
Imagine projecting your own sensitivity onto others because you can’t handle the fact that your precious United Kingdom will be dead within the decade
Imagine being so far up Boris Johnson’s arse that you came all over your room when he said there is no border between England and Scotland
State of you ya cunt go take a well hard look at yourself you arse licking cleg
Yeah complaining is unique only in Scotland, no one else in the UK complains about anything its our unique quirk, everyone else is sunshine and posies
Mate a think you’ve spelt your name wrong it says disillusioned Brit surely you mean delusional brit
Yes but aren't schuko plugs less safe from the electrical aspect in that they're not fused and not always grounded
And also I guess the fact that they don't have switches on the socket like we do is probably another thing
We didn’t have a real name for the people who were part of Siol nan Gaidheal
We just called them arseholes
Same for the Union of British Fascists
They were also deemed “arseholes
In the UK such a man might be called Colonel Blimp
I'm a native English speaker who works in an 'International English' environment
There are quite a few words, expressions and idioms that I'd use in my own English that I cannot use in that environment, because they are not universally understood in international English
So I'm very conscious about when I'm using Scottish English (as vehicle of national culture) and when I'm using International English (as a means of global communication)
Fifa surely
Colin McRae Rally/DiRT series is pretty ace tbh, even if I still find the original PS1 titles as my favourite
Gotta love the cheat code to make the cars into hovercars
Doing that to the Audi Quattro was always a terrifying challenge ahehe
I'd like to say thanks to the countries of the EU that made the last 40 years amazing
Thanks to the Netherlands for providing us with plenty of plants
Ireland: Thank you for the good craic and for being brave enough to go your own way a little over a century before we started venturing in that direction
Northern Ireland: Thank you for being the only country that really understands our sense of humour
England: Thank you for all the money you give us to prop up the economy
Norway: Thank you for giving us the Northern Isles as a wedding present
Denmark: Thank you for not invading us over all that oil you sort of claim
I would like to thank England for absolutley fuck all
> Mate, us people in my city up north never wanted any of this shite
[The majority of the north of England did, though
Popular local soft drink
It has to be Irn Bru
I believe we’re one of very few countries in the world where a local drink is more popular than Coca Cola
IRN-BRU , it is one it the only soft drinks in the world that outsells coca cola in a country
It's my favourite drink and could not live without it
I haven’t seen those for ages
They’re great
I wish it was the same in the UK, but the past is constantly romanticised
I’m half German and growing up that’s been shit on, constantly
Agreed
The UK is going through a "culture war" between the people who want to acknowledge that the British empire wasn't great for a lot of the world, and those who want to whitewash history and pretend the bad stuff never happened
It's not healthy, and it's worrying that even our government is trying to only allow a rose tinted version of history to be acceptable
In the UK the view of the rural area varys a lot depending on where the rural area is
I grew up in the South West, a place called north devon
Very rural, about 70% farmland/fields
So naturally when you meet someone not from the area and you say "Im from north devon" they instantly assume youre a farmer
Go onto google and search up "devonshire accent" or "westcountry yap" thats what everyone thinks we sound like but most of us dont, its mostly just the actual farmers that grow up in isolated farm houses that sound like that, which is a pretty small part of the population here
Depends on where they are
Rural Highlanders are called Teuchters, their seen as very SNP, Gaelic speaking, Potato eating crofters who can’t stop saying the words Michty Me and playing Shinty
Rural Aberdonians shag sheep
Rural people in Perth and Kinross are seen as posh tories
Fifers are seen as one eyed 12 toed mutants no matter rural or urban
Edit: Borders are Tories, Ayrshire is full of bigots and neds, East Lothian is full of Farmer wanks, Midlothian is full of Wanks, West Lothian is full of top shaggers except Linlithgow who are tories
Only stereotype being people tend to think they are richer and more right wing, some people would refer to them as sheep shaggers because they are from the country
But not much difference haha
What the hell is going on there on this day
I stayed just outside Madrid during my gap year and I can't even imagine this
I spent the whole time melting and gulping down cafe con hielo even when it was "cool" outside
I hope you make the most of it
207 people killed in a coal mining explosion in Blantyre in the late 19th century
As for Beirut, it's heartbreaking - Beirut has not had a happy history
Probably the Lockerbie bombing where Pan Am flight 103 was brought down by a terrorist bomb over Scotland in 1988 killing 270 people, to this day the second worst terrorist attack in European history
Explosion in Clarkston on October 21st 1971
A buildup of gas from a leaky mains destroyed several shops and a car park, killing 21 people, mostly shop workers, customers and the passengers of a passing bus
England - despite the rivalry we have always had, the jokes are just for fun and no harm is meant
Youre our sister nation and we are more alike than we would like to believe
You have the best humour, the greatest stoicism and the most humbling generosity of any other people I've known
Wales - we love you, you glorious sheepshagging rogues
You remind us of ourselves
Never met an unfriendly Welshman and doubt that will ever change
France - we love to joke about you, but behind your reputable arrogance there is a true honesty and sincerity that we can truly appreciate
Germany - The friendliest and most welcoming people I've ever met (but not in Berlin), I've always made German friends on holiday
The most approachable and easy going people around in my experience
England: err
Thanks for forcing the Irish to learn English so they gave the world James Joyce

Yep, and it definitely does the job
No I do not

* Arse end of nowhere
* Timbuktoo

In English we say “We had to by China” if a long diversion is required
Also "dove ha perso le scarpe il signore" (Where the Lord lost his shoes)
England gets a lot of shit for being full of bigots but truth be told we're a lot less tolerent than a lot of people want to pretend
Well tbf the SNP currently hold 47 out of 59 Scottish seats in Westminster (something like 79% or 80%) when the country had been dyed-in-the-wool Labour for close to 100 years before that
Gaining one seat is nowhere near the level of gains that the SNP have made in Scotland
Jeez we’re even bigoted towards each other
There is mate
They're called Unionists
Yeah in Scotland people from Aberdeen often get called sheep shaggers
Especially the football team
Why do American cities have so few medieval castles and churches
I just can't figure it out
>Here in Dublin in the 1960s some very nice buildings were knocked down and replaced with buildings that could only be described as eyesores and completely out of character with the buildings around them
The same thing happened in Glasgow
Beautiful tenement flats where bulldozed and replaced with these ugly cheep high rises that are to this day seen as a symbol of poverty
It’s horrible driving through the city, seeing all the beautiful Georgian architecture (which admittedly would look better if the sun ever bothered to show up), only to be blindsided by the towering-yet-pathetic image of these ugly high rises
Very common with English - so many countries have variants
The obvious being the USA, but there's also very strong localisation in place like India, Barbados and other (former) commonwealth countries
It doesn't bother me that a visitor uses their version of English, especially as they may not be away that certain words aren't understood in our version of English
We even see it within the UK - for example, here in Scotland, "outwith" is used regularly, but is unheard of in much of England (although it should be obvious in context)
I would expect that if someone chooses to live in the UK that they start using UK spellings eventually
But it's not a big deal
English is such a mess of a language and is customised by so many countries and even regions within countries that it would be a bit silly to get upset over it
It depends entirely on how it's done
If it's done to avoid misunderstandings and ease communications, that's great
If it's done to mock us, it'll be received badly
That'd be *really* weird if that were to happen
Obviously if they've lived here for loads of years and just start doing it naturally then it's no bother, but if they come here and actively try then they're just gonna make themselves look stupid and weird
It depends who it is, I love Australian slang and the Caribbean dialects basically every English adaptation is cool with me
Unless it’s Americans (specifically Californians)
I just find a lot of what they say really cringe
Messages = Groceries is the only familiar one to me
> Their habit of dropping ‘and’ after the word ‘go’ is annoying too
Americans always ‘Go do’, ‘Go make’, ‘Go visit’ etc
It always sounds really illiterate (‘me go visit man’)
This, and saying things like "Last week I wrote her" instead of "Last week I wrote *to* her"
And don't even get me started on what they've done to adverbs
Weren't flipflops 'thongs'?
I've only heard it pronounced that way, remember cause it sounds like the ladies garment, not the kitchen utensil
France
They eat frogs
And Germany oh Germany, 3 words: failed conquest, TWICE
I guess this is why on average you Portuguese have better with English - since you only have subtitles in Portuguese with the original English voice
I've got to be completely fair and say that England is constantly shat on so it's somewhat fair for them to chuck it back in some way
On the other hand, getting out of bed in winter must be difficult for you guys - sunrise must be at like 9 am
>Why the rest of the UK seem to hate us but we like them
What
That's just not true, we don't. And it doesn't help that the media likes to portray it that way
But it was invented in Scotland and we're unlikely to win even in 100 years haha
> You say you don't hate England but in all honesty it feels like you do, some of the time
I feel a lot of this is Scottish/Welsh/NI people criticising the UK govt or institutions, and English people taking it as an attack on them
Hoover is what pretty much everyone I know calls a vacuum cleaner
Get the Hoovering done etc
Nutella in the uk is just the word we use for any kind of chocolaty spread
Doesn’t matter what brand actually made it
It’s always just referred to as Nutella
"Wheres the castle
They asked in Edinburgh city centre, in full view of the castle
I think the tourists cracking open a six pack at the summit of Ben Nevis and loudly asking if the small, emergency shelter at the summit was a bar
No it is not
No one is going to go up our tallest mountain to sell you lot beer before you decide to drunkenly nosedive off a precipice
That is not what is going to happen
I can understand maybe a tiny thing to celebrate the summit, but getting hammered up there just seemed so enormously stupid
I live in Edinburgh so its amplified a bit
I've been on arthur seat (the main hill in Central Edinburgh) and people have asked me, where is Arthur Seat
Right up there ya donut
Ask a bus driver if they go to a specific hotel
Ask if they can pay in euros
Ask why the castle is so far away from the railway station
And best of all, asking people what clan they are part of and how they are looking for clan whatever that they grandfathers aunties dog was allegedly part of in 1339
I've told it before here but the short version is Chinese tourist threatens me (bouncer) with knife, gets knocked out, spends several days in hospital, may or may not have lost sight in one eye and got arrested
&#x200B;
For something I haven't said here before I've seen Chinese tourists drive on the wrong side of the road before
In Edinburgh and American said how convenient it was that they built the (1000+year old castle) next to the train station
Wait for a solid 10 minutes at a cross road waiting for the red light to go green even though there is not a car in sight
Did it break both arms, or just one
I believe we that's just the international cunt
Had some Americans say the same thing to me a couple of times as well
How they don't see how amazingly insulting that is to say is beyond me
Apparently there is a lot of interchange in Spanish, Italian, and Potruguese and it's possible to have conversations if you keep to very basic words
But due to French having different noises they get left out
I thoight the general rule in museums was no flash, anyway
Oh god, reminded me of how they swarm onto the main road of this little village, fucking up traffic and oblivious to the rather generously large pavements they could use and not obstruct the roads
I'd almost wish they would be patient enough to wait a bit in the station, since they end up complaining about lack of things to do in a place they've just doubled the population of on arrival
"Yeah you know that massive fucking hill with a castle on it visible for miles and miles, its there"
Also love 'have a bad day'. Legitimately made me laugh :)
It's not far at all
But if you don't know how to get there it can be confusing
Also Americans don't really walk anywhere
Either that guy was very fucking stupid or he knew where he was and what he was doing
You don't scream Heil Hitler in St Pauli and not get punched in the face there
Did you enjoy your trip
I think I know the one you mean, Crammond right
People outside of glasgow get called teuchters(chook-ters)
\*Teuchterland\* - a \*teuchter\* is a countryside dweller
It's not a capital city affectation, instead you're more likely to encounter the attitude from our biggest city, Glasgow, where anything not-Glasgow is seen as "teuchter" (including Scotland's 6 other cities)
Depends where you live
Where I live
unless your job pays you to jump about, you don't, and not abroad
Given the capital of Scotland is a nice 4hrs drive/6hrs train away, it's just not really common to jump abroad (or even to England) on the regular
Border regions are likely different cases from places on the periphery like where I live, but it varies greatly
Certainly would be wrong to think every European is constantly border hopping, I'd be surprised if a majority does it very frequently
But then, that might just be the perspective from my location and economic class
Edit: this is all seperate from holidays, which are often international, though holidays with the same country are not uncommon
Visited a friend working there
Glad she allowed me to stay at her flat, cause just paying for a small amount of food and some trains made that country to most expensive trip I've had
Felt like eveything was x3-x5 more expensive for no discernible reason
How is travel different in America
It’s a 43 hour drive, it’s like driving from Paris to Moscow
Yeah schools are a bit different for it but as an individual you could in theory just get up one day and drive around Europe just cause you want to
Yah
For example, the school trip for my small highschool in the Scottish Highlands was to London, with a few other things in England (believe Alton Parks was part of it, wherever they are in southern(?) England)
Location and budget likely matters (although saying that, that school trip was way too expensive, cost about twice the cost for me to go on it than my whole families trip to Morocco, France or Spain)
My favourite is Spanglish
Sounds like a bouncing fish
*chorey* meaning to steal, and *gadgie* meaning young man both come from Romany, which is surprising, as Romany people have not otherwise had a big cultural impact on Scotland
> "Vigéc" is a very old-fashioned word for travelling salesmen
It comes from German "Wie geht’s Ihnen
" (How are you
), because that is how Austrian travelling salesmen introduced themselves back in the 19th century
This has made my day
If you are a 17th century Jew fleeing religious persecution, where are you going to go: Catholic Brussels, or Protestant-Secular Amsterdam
We also use dram in Scots (for whisky, not snaps)
If you define Scots as a language, it's that
If not, probably Scots Gaelic
Depends
If we are talking native languages to the country, Scots (if it’s counted as one) is easily the biggest
If not Gaelic is
If we are talking all languages, either Polish or Urdu for immigrants
If we are talking L2, then we usually do French in schools and also Spanish but we are a fairly monolingual country (if you don’t count Scots as a language)
Most people don’t know how to use basic computer programs but have Admin and IT as a class for the first two years of high school so normally pick up some basic ability
I've noticed that with some graduates who have recently started at my work, in their early to mid-20s.
I do IT support, and I think a lot of the younger generation now are geared towards point and click wizards for doing everything on tablets, so there's definitely diminished basic IT skills when it comes to a desktop operating system for a lot of them
> I found in secondary school people lacked basic skills for computers and people needed to be taught basics like MS word
Creating and organising folders
Can attest to this, I work IT Support and we have uni graduates in their early to mid 20's who have no idea how to connect a Windows laptop to their home WiFi, despite having a printed reference guide in front of them with images showing exactly how to do it
I think a lot of the younger generation, outside those like yourself with an active interest in computers, who are used to mobile OS' with very simplified GUIs and they don't know how to do a lot of things that are considered the basics on a proper OS
I’m disappointed because at the time of posting this comment, this thread was sitting on 423 comments

The one that gets me is Hamish, because Hamish is literally a gaelicisation of James in the vocative case
I have also seen "Itzan" - which looks more Basque to me, but might also just be a version of Ethan
Shawn is worse to me
I will instinctively spell it Sean unless corrected
‘Chrzaszcz’ (I don’t have the correct ‘a’ on my keyboard :( )remains my favourite polish word
It looks like nonsense, but when you learn the sounds and break it down it makes sense suddenly why it’s pronounced that way
There are often a few specific mistakes like pluralising things that shouldn't be pluralised but other than these few specific things it's really very good
I probably make more mistakes by just typing fast
I never really find myself reading posts here and thinking to myself "yep, that's a non native english speaker", so I'd say it's at a fairly high level
Wish I had the balls to do something like at least for some period of time but I'm.settling down with my partner so I think the time has passed
Besides Scotlands no bad
But if did it would be maybe Canada or Germany
I'm still gutted
Ours is Rèile which due to us being lazy, literally just translates to rail
There is very little "unspoiled" areas in Scotland - even the remote wilderness areas were deforested for sheep grazing or deer stalking
Areas like the Cairngorm plateau and the Knoydart peninsula are almost empty though, and you could travel for miles without seeing another person
[According to Atlas Obscura] the most remote place in Britain is only 5
7 miles from a road
I imagine it is closer to other evidence of human habitation, like trails
But the north of Scotland has been inhabited for a good 10,000 years, so there is sure to be evidence of human activity around wherever you go
I'm sure someone could write a script using the OpenStreetMap API to find the point in a country furthest from all roads, could be interesting
Completely untouched pure wilderness
Not really, the highlands of Scotland are mostly an artificial habitat created by bronze age tree felling and modern sheep farming
But it's still pretty wild and you can go up there and not see another person for days if you're remote enough
You might not see a lot of people, but there’s a shit ton of sheep
The southern uplands are reasonably untouched tbh
They're pretty empty, but they're not untouched
Almost all the open moorland is used for sheep, and most of the forest there is planted timber forest
Unfortunately climate change is making the midges worse
> well it's difficult to translate because there's no English word for it, but "Finland is [like someone who lives in and off the forest]"
"Woodsman" can be used in English in this context for a skilled person, or "Forrester", if it's a profession
Ah, fair enough
Languages can be interesting in that way
Head of State I doubt any fucker would care especially given they're A) parasites with no actual power and B) German already
Head of Government however I could see being an issue with people
Regardless of which government Im talking about
I think if the Scottish first minister was foreign (rUK included), nobody would really give a fuck, as long as they live here they’d be fine
If they had an English accent it might be a problem to some, but not really a big deal
Boris Johnson was born in America and I actually only found out a couple of months ago, so not that controversial
I only ever hear about it with other points being made against him but I don't think the fact itself is worrying that many people, it's just when it's grouped up with him being not that great
I don't know about all of that, but it still fits in with the question
None of them, journalism is dead as is the politics it comments on
I think we'd have to say France
Auld alliance and hundred of years of mutual hate of the bloody Sassanachs
Sad Scotland noises
Scotland hates everybody, even Scotland
Sorry pals x
Until we went bankrupt trying trying to build a Panama cannel, funded by selling woollen jumpers to the natives
And for some reason only England bailed us out
And didn't attack us
The Auld Alliance is 3 times older than the USA
> You can take the piss out of someone and it shows how much you like them
The better you know someone, the more you can take the piss out of them
This is also true of Scotland, I think
I don't think that there's been a breakdown on air in Scotland from a politician but I will say that our First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has been looking distressed at times due to the current Pandemic, announcing the Daily Updates she has admitted at times she has been crying due to the fact that announcing the amount of people who have died
She has also had to deal with The Scottish Labour Party trying to stop The Daily Updates on Television because they claim that they are (I still can't believe that they had the gall to do this) "Political Broadcasts" which is baffling because at no point in them has Nicola Sturgeon clearly promoted her party through them, The SNP
At one point in the summer they actually got them stopped on BBC Scotland which annoyed her to say the least as for some people in Scotland the Daily Updates where their way of keeping up to date with the changes in circumstances to the current Pandemic
A statue in Glasgow had a traffic cone put on its head by someone drunk and every time it gets removed someone else puts it back
When the government said they where going to remove the statue a petition was made to keep it
It is a statue of the duke of wellington
D I S G U S T A N G (I still hear people saying it in the street on nights out and it still cracks me up
"Am gonny sing Cher Lloyd by Cher Lloyd" comes from the same video)
Also putting a traffic cone (and other seasonal accessories) on the statue in front of the GOMA in Glasgow so much so few can remember the name of the statue other than the Traffic Cone Statue
If anyone's curious it's the Duke of Wellington
Whenever the police take it down, a Weegie will risk it to put another up so for the majority of the time the police don't do anything anymore
Another runner up is whenever a tourist from South of the border is visiting and you're either showing them around or telling them about the area, sometimes throw in a wee fact about the elusive haggis animal
It isn't true and most people get that you're teasing them, but sometimes you'll get Mr and Mrs Gullible you can have a field day with
The British Parliament
Yer da sells Avon
Boris Johnson
Any quote from still game really
Too right and sometimes it evolves
Oh fuck yeah I didn't even think to say that, I went with the fact we all use and recognise patter from still game or chewing the fat
I lived together with two french dudes during my Erasmus Semester
One from the north and one from the south
There were heated discussions
Also - "TRAMPOLINE
My entire school independently decided that we’d get my Syrian mate with that when he moved here
No one planed it
I just remember telling him about haggis and him already knowing about it
The fact we're still part of the UK
u/forkingandcountryx your comment was so brave and heroic
Was there a point in that or was it an invite for a jab at how many Westminster MPs have been a bit fond of kids
Our parliament isn't run entirely by people who weren't voted for by even a slim minority of the population of the country at least which the British government is
Sadly our government does have to however it is frequently protested by members being sworn in, from different parties, not just the SNP
Only reason they have to do it up here as well is because we're still joined at the hip to the UK gov
Because in Scotland we don't recognise Parliamentary Supremacy which allows Westminster to have theoretically complete power over the UK, acting with the full power of the monarch
PS isn't found anywhere in Scots Law, we even have case law saying PS has never and never will be recognised in Scotland, and its not like its even law in England
Its just a tradition made before the Union that the English kept
Instead in Scotland we have legally binding Popular Supremacy
The monarch is our sovereign but is not our political leader, it is instead the people who are supreme
Kings and Queens of Scots never had complete dominance like the Kings of England, they instead were a High Chief that had to find the respect of "lower" Chiefs if they wanted them to do something, and this relationship transferred when the Scottish Parliament was formed
This does tend to complicate things in the Union, and its a question no Judge in their right mind will ever want to figure out the answer
In England, the UK Parliament is supreme over all power with no authority that can question it without its permission
In Scotland, Parliamentary Supremacy does not legally exist, and the people are supreme over the country and as they directly elect the modern Scottish Parliament, Scots Law technically says the Scottish Parliament is supreme over all power and only the Scottish people can question it
Apologies if my wording isn't great, what I'm trying to say is; the British government is mostly comprised of seats/members whose party was not voted for in Scotland by a country mile
Long&short: we're run by Tories, Tories are vastly unpopular up here and no matter what way we vote our votes are essentially null and void Vs England
Take the last GE or Brexit as examples
45% referendum support was 6 years ago and a lot has changed since then
Lib Dems are Tory turncoats who happily accept Tories that have crossed the floor and Scottish Labour is a mere shadow of what British Labour are (and with JC going from BL I don't see that getting better, nevermind SL) so they will likely never see a return to the forefront in Scotland, at least not for British Government
For the reasons I mentioned above I don't consider Scottish Labour to be the same as British Labour so I couldn't say that the majority voted for British parties, Scottish Greens included as they're separate from English Greens
I'll be very interested to see the results here next year, hopefully we can see more in terms of IndyRef2 before then though
Not really, there's plenty of people who dislike the SNP but want independence, frankly the SNP are shit but I'll vote for them if it's a step on the road to independence, others don't quite think the same
There is more support for independence now than there was 6 years ago and the British gov/Tories can't/don't want to see that
SNP vote =/= lack of indy support
Also hoping you're Scottish because an Englishman/Welshman/Irishman (all walk into a bar) should have no say in this
I get your point and I'm not trying to exclude you for that, I'm saying you should be excluded if you don't live here or are not from here
>Excluded from what
Nobody is stopping you from saying facts but I'm saying you shouldn't have a voice with any weight in this debate
>I don't see the point in any of it
Then don't take part
Nobody asked you to, your ancestry is of no relevance and the breakup of an old af imperialist nonsense "union" is a step forward if the nation states that are a part of it are being held back by said union
Do you live in Scotland
Or are you from here
Then why should you have a voice in *Scottish* independence
I follow the international geopolitics, and keep an eye on big events
I don't really follow the internal politics of other countries that closely, although I keep more of an eye on Germany because I used to live there
Yes I follow European politics quite closely, my interest peaks around election season in each respective country but I think I could tell you at least a bit about most European countries politics but more about,
UK, Spain, Portugal, Poland, Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, Greece than the others
> I actually used to care about the US politics way more than my country's.
I find this is relatively common
In Uni, I knew plenty of people who followed American politics so closely that they forgot who their own MP here in the UK was
I find it a bit sad
People will be outraged at something an American Congressman said on the other side of the Atlantic, yet they know absolutely nothing about Ireland's politics even though they are our direct neighbours and used to be a part of the UK
Reddit, as a mostly English speaking website, probably attracts the type of people who follow American domestic politics

The *Aonach Eagach* hiking route is nicknamed "brown trouser ridge" for the fear it induces in hikers
We've a lot of abandoned castles throughout the country, including *Slains Castle*, supposedly the inspiration for Bram Stoker
Personally, though, trying to walk back from Ibrox to the city centre after Aberdeen have beaten rangers, and the natives aren't happy is the place that's shit me up a few times
When I went to Mary Kings close in Edinburgh (when I was like 7) I thought it was the scariest place I’d ever been
That's a good shout, actually
I've not been myself, but I've heard it's put the willies up a few folk
Right now, my scariest place is Hampden, having just watched Aberdeen make an arse of it in yet another semi-final
Nice of Aberdeen to do the yearly rollover for us, was worried yous were gonny put in a shift after last week
But tbh Torry and Tillydrone at night is probably one of the sketchiest places to be in Scotland
We limited our rollover to a 20 minute period in the first half
As ever, though, any hint of a rollover to a team like celtic - even in their current, stuttering form - only ever ends one way
Torry's improved massively these days; the influx of ambitious young Polish immigrants has lifted the area (in contrast to the common stereotype of immigration), but Tilly's still rough as fuck
>We limited our rollover to a 20 minute period in the first half
We obliged by limiting our creative attacking play to a 20 minute window as well, sporting integrity at its finest
Yeah tbf I've worked in Torry and it wasn't *that* bad during the day, there was the odd scrap outside our shop but nothing mental, still wouldn't fancy wandering alone at night haha
My ex gf was from Tilly, we used to visit her family there on occasion
what a shithole haha, could never get away quick enough
The thing is, though, unless you're looking for trouble, there's generally no reason to visit Tilly
It's not even on the way to anywhere, as it's tucked away inside the bend in the river
It had a bad reputation because the local "adventurous types" would prey on the easy pickings from the students at Hillhead
Us Scots are the masters of it
Regarding teenage drinking, drunk experiences and parties well before the legal drinking age, very common, although apparently it's dropped in the past decade
Scotland has a pretty severe problem with alcohol  (you may have heard about our introduction of minimum unit pricing last year; first country in the world to do so apparently
kind of a dubious honour
) so punishments for selling to underagers are severe
Back when I was working McJobs 10 years ago, you, the pleb behind the counter could get both fined AND a prison sentence, up to £5000 and five years if I remember correctly
So yeah, *most* people in shops are pretty strict seeing as their own arse is on the line but not everyone
Also kids will always have older friends, brothers, sisters, cousins and so on so if they want booze they can usually get it
It’s apart of our identity as a people
Hmm I wonder why
We definitely can't. Our laws on alcohol are different from the rest of the UK and are significantly more severe as a result of our nation's issues with alcohol
We still have 10am to 10pm hours for shops
We were the first country in the world to introduce minimum unit pricing
Any poor sod that sells to an underager or to someone they have reason to believe is buying on behalf of an underager can face *both* a £5000 fine and a five year prison sentence
Those figures may have changed since I last worked in shops but if they have they'll have gone up not down
Ouch man
u/dani3l_554 has a good writeup on the UK as a whole
In Scotland, we have 3 left-leaning parties: the SNP, Greens and Labour
One centre party, the Lib Dems, and one right-wing party, the Conservatives
Despite having a proportional system we only have 5 parties, mainly because 3 of them (Labour, Lib, Conservatives) answer to their UK counterparts so can't really split up
Of course many people vote solely on their constitutional preferences, so even centre-right people who want independence will vote SNP
There's no real centre-right parties, but I can't imagine there will be unless we become independent
In our system we have a system called the additional member system (AMS, sometimes also called Mixed Member Proportional) which works as a balance between PR and FPTP
We tend to have more representative elections
Our current parliament is
SNP Centre-Left - 63
Conservatives, Liberal-Conservative, Centre - 31
Labour, Left wing - 24
Green, Left Wing - 6
Liberal Democrats, Centre - 5
Whole parliament is 129 MP's, although apart from once we haven't had a majority party elected as the system is designed to prevent majorities
Great comment, I just wanna add a little about the SNP cause I think saying “they tend to do well in Scotland” doesn’t quite make clear how dominant they are
The SNP have been in power in Scotland for 15 years now (they’ve only lost one national election) and they are predicted to win next years by a pretty substantial margin
They’ve also done better than every other party in UK elections for the last few elections (I’m not sure about the elections before 2010), and actually won almost every seat in 2015
It’s honestly hard to imagine any other party coming close to beating them atm
>  I don't understand how the Brits and Americans can stand it
For the UK, it's mostly because lots of people are simply not invested in politics at all
There's no big public rallying to change the system, people just sort of shrug and go "oh well".
> the Liberal Democrats are the 3rd largest but have no chance of winning
Not in term of representation in Parliament or party membership, they're not
Yeah mainly because the other parties just follow whatever the English counterpart says which leads to a lot of u-turns
Makes them seem extremely weak compared to SNP
Hey now, Canada uses it too
That’s very very simplistic tho
It’s a bit more complicated when you get into it
Yeah that’s exactly it tho
You’re an outsider comparing the UKs political parties alignments to your countries
News flash, different nations have different views
In the UK Labour and Tory are left and right
I have a subscription to The Guardian and I also financially support The National
I don't agree with every aspect of their editorial stances, but I am glad they exist in a UK/Scottish media market otherwise dominated by right-wing pro-Brexit Tories and British nationalists

When the COVID-19 pandemic put paid to this the Minster was unable to continue assisting the school
[16] Therefore the school had to announce that it would be closing for good at the end of the Summer Term 2020
This school, although technically founded in 1903, supposedly traces its heritage back to the 7th century
It's quite sad to see it close down
In your language, is there an equivalent phrase for "fair enough
In English, this is such a useful and commonly used phrase to indicate when you accept something that someone has just said or done
You don't necessarily agree with what they have said or done (depending on the context), but you accept it - it doesn't massively bother you
Now, the spelling may be off (its been a while) but it's 'ceart gu leor' in Gaelic, which I take as correct'
/right (for 'ceart') enough ('gu leor')
It also means 'alright', but I've heard it used in the same vein as 'fair enough', so eh
>I'm not sure if I fully agree with you definition of "fair enough".
Fair enough
I thought something with "vale" would be the closest, since it's more like "okay". At least in the way that I would use it, though Spanish definitely has much more colourful and effective ways of getting points across haha
Unos amigos españoles me han dicho que no existe ninguna traducción literal
Hasta me dijo una amiga que si estuviera hablando con otro español que pudiera hablar ingles, lo diría en inglés a veces, porque funciona tan bien
Pero quizá sea solo ella
Always been awful with accents, even through school, so I sort of expected something like that ahaha
Cheers for the look over
No he oído de eso nunca, aunque no soy hablante nativo
En qué contexto lo usaría?
I wouldn't even have existed at any point, my grandmother would have likely died in childbirth so my mother wouldn't have survived either
Even if she did we both would have definitely died when she gave birth to me, so yes thank you very much modern medicine and c-sections
Probably a farmer, or murdered/abandoned by my parents for being too annoying
Or starved to death, or in an asylum (I loved lighting fires as a kid) or a murderer
Luckily I was born completely healthy and had no life threatening problems as a child
I've traced my family tree back to the 1750s. My ancestors around 1819 would have been weavers or slaters
I grew up being told it was Lapland but with American influence it seems most people refer to the North Pole nowadays
He actually did hang out in Hell for a bit
>the Harrowing of Hell (Latin: Descensus Christi ad Inferos, "the descent of Christ into Hell") is the triumphant descent of Christ into Hell (or Hades) between the time of his Crucifixion and his Resurrection when he brought salvation to all of the righteous who had died since the beginning of the world
[1] After his death, Jesus descended into the realm of the dead
I recently learned that the iconic Carol of the Bells is Ukrainian too
They make some fantastic carols there
There’s a common rumour that Scottish people eat deep fried mars bars
I’m pretty sure it started out as just a fun little joke about how unhealthily we tend to eat, but it’s actually taken route as a somewhat commonly believed myth
The thing is, a lot of English tourists go out of their way to hunt for these famous mars bars, so a lot of cafes in the really touristy parts of the country actually decided to sell them
So then these tourist return home now fully believing that deep fried mars bars are a staple Scottish snack because they saw them on the menu at a cafe, and proceed to spread the rumour further
Yeah, something similar but with whiskey
Working in a grocery store and continually asked whats the best whiskey and
err, I don't drink it personally man
Don't like the stuff
>That we're Scotland
There's plenty of similar stories related to Scotland being part of Ireland too
There's a TV trope in the US about mixing up Scotland and Ireland which definitely doesnt help
They are quite good though, especially with ice cream
Grew up in a seaside town in south west england that relied on tourism, a LOT of chippies
Almost all of them sold deep fried mars bars
Tbf they taste really good (also taste like diabetes ngl)
But I never understood why it was associated with scotland when it seems like they do it because the english wanted them when they go
Id say a more scottish thing is definitely IRNBRU  my gran was scottish and for the most part favourite alcohoic drink was IRNBRU and vodka (she loved a good ol' baileys on the rocks before she passed)
Miss my gran, cant wait to go back to see my family up there, from the great town of kirkintilloch
Funnily enough, some Greeks, however, did go round on camels
(About a 100 years ago, and presumably in very small numbers)
It happens to me all the time when I'm abroad
This exact conversation has played out on more than one occasion:
Driver: 'Were are you from
Me: 'Scotland'
Driver: 'Yes - Scotland, very nice, Dublin, Guinness
Me: 'No, that's Ireland
I'm from Scotland
Different country
Driver: 'Is same thing
In my taxi I have many Irish peoples
The stereotype that Scottish people are almost universally addicted to Irn bru is probably more common, but I wouldn’t put it on this post because it’s more or less true
Thats a very valid point
I believe RBS are still pretty archaic in their technological practises
Can you elaborate on how these words modify the meaning
So the club 'Nachtisch' that I used to go to in Bonn, would be called dessert in English
Yiddish terms are very much an American thing though (especially from New York), in the UK we don't come across them as much
Oh yeah you're absolutely right  it was a couple years ago so memory is a bit foggy
So what would that translate to if you don't mind
Hahaha I spent most of my time in irish bars tbh, always a great time  ''The dubliner" or "James Joyce" took up most of my time, every Thursday there was a beer pong tournament at the Dubliner, the Germans normally crushed me tbh but it was good craic
Actually really enjoyed Bonn, its kind of just a little student town so was good for Erasmus
[The Lanthorn in Livingston]
Behold a Library, Sports Hall, Cafe and Catholic Church
All in one building
It’s had a bit of a glow up recently but back when I used to cut about there it was fucking ugly
[Cumbernauld] could also take the cake but
There is a wee chapel but it’s too small so it’s used for children’s liturgy while the sports hall is used for mass
I actually had a bit of a weird one in this regard
So state schools in Scotland teach religious studies, ie learning about a specific religions traditions, beliefs, and in some cases history
Throughout my school career I learned about Islam, Sikhism, Islam, Judaism, Islam, and Buddhism (I think a lot of teachers want to teach Islam because they wanna teach people from a young age that “no actually, Muslims are not all bloodthirsty savage terrorists”)
This is where it gets a little iffy
The headteacher  of my primary school for the first few years was an extremely religious woman
She had the local whatever-the-guy-who-stands-at-the-front-of-a-Protestant-church-and-talks-about-Jesus-is-called come in and give talks on being a good Christian every week
When we did music it we would have to sing hymns or, like, fun Christian songs about god, and we went to the local church at pretty much every available opportunity, sometimes even for a sermon
The Anyway, she moved to a different school, then years later I found out that whole thing was arguably illegal
TLDR: you’re supposed to just get a loose summary of a bunch of different religions, but due to racists most of that ended up having to be about Islam, and also my teacher tried to indoctrinate me
Yes although the one true religion isn't taught, it's an outrage if you ask me
We have RMPS/RME which is religious moral philosophical studies and religious moral education respectfully but that’s about learning about religion, not teaching it
However in my primary school they really did try make us Christian despite being a secular public school
We were made to pray, sing hymns, go to church on Easter etc and when we were taught about other religions they used a them and us language, saying ‘them’ to describe any other religion and ‘us’ to describe Christianity which was pretty gross
In my school we are taught RMPS (religious, moral and philosophical studies) so we can broaden our knowledge on different religions and such
Currently we are learning about Judaism, and we were leaning about Hinduism last year
I think it's really great that we're taught this, as before this I had no idea about all these other religions
Our school's population (idk what other word to use) is mainly Christian or Athiest, so it's brilliant to inform others about other things that they might not know about
Same
There's an elective I think, but my school didn't run it (too wee for that sort of spread pf subjects), but there was some core Religious Education that did as you said
Teach you about various religions, particularly important if you aren't in a city I expect, means even if you haven't met anyone of such faiths yet, you will know about them, and hopefully decrease the 'unfamiliar as strange and frightening' reaction that fuels so many poor interactions
Sets you up for better later on, essentially
We didn't really have prayers or the hymns in mine
Did, towards Christmas, go down to the local churches (alternating between the Catholic church and the Protestant Kirk every year) around Christmas for that, but it was opt out and I think mostly just a way to have people experience and see both of the major faiths in the area, so just an extension of RE familiarising you with other faiths in my view
But aside from that, it was pretty much just the basics of each religion and some of their holy days, etc
Tell him that the Dutch eat chocolate sprinkles for breakfast
I remember first visiting the USA and getting very confused as to why they had these horribly worn dollar bills and all of these vending machines that accepted paper money
which were rejected by most of the vending machines due to the condition of most of the dollar bills
Seriously, coins are better for small amounts
Glasgow
It’s Scotland’s largest city and Edinburgh’s rival
Every other city is either to small or to out if I he way
You could make an argument for Stirling since it used to be the capital and is a bit more central than any other city, but it’s barely more than a large town
Inverness/northern area so the government would be forced to give money to places other than the central belt
Glasgow because it’s the biggest city in Scotland and probably the most important
In Scotland it would probably be Glasgow since it’s the only other “big” city
You could maybe put it in Sterling just to have it close to the centre of the country
There's a case for keeping Westminster as the capital of England and as the site of the English Parliament and English Government, but moving the capital of the UK, and the UK Parliament & Government, to another (preferably northern) city
However, present constitutional arrangements don't allow that, because there are no separate English-only institutions
Inverness
For either the British capital, the Scottish capital, or both
Mostly just to confuse things, but it might also help inject the area and the Highlands more generally with more people, bringing more services to the Highlands
In Scotland it would probably be Glasgow since it’s the only other “big” city
You could maybe put it in Sterling just to have it close to the centre of the country
I just assumed Copenhagen was on Jutland for the longest time because why would any self-respecting country have its capital on the non-mainland bit
Nosyat i pesen ot Plovdiv rodena
That, and Glasgow's miles better
When you say the UK, do you mean England
Does anything ever happen in Bonn
It seems like it's only known for being the old capital of West Germany
You never hear anything about it any more
People say Bielefeld doesn't exist, but I feel like Bonn is the one that doesn't actually exist
Give Falkirk city status and then make it Falkirk for a laugh
Kirkwall is orkney, but your point still stands
Ordnance Survey put it near [Morecambe Bay] for geographic, and near Derby for the population - further north than Birmingham
Manchester would fit between the two of those points
Edit: fixed broken link
Hmmm it’s complicated
Lots of people like the EU here but I wouldn’t say we are very important
But compare to England we are very divided
You either love the EU or you despise it, the cities tend to love it but a lot of villages especially around where I live that have been devastated by overfishing couldn’t give you one nice word about the EU
We’re the country that reminds everyone else that asking your population to vote for or against something half of them had never heard of and the other half didn’t understand is actually a bad idea
Who could’ve predicted that
We're probably the main reason the EU doesn't just completely disown Britain tbh, even though Scotland is more or less the same as England, but we're more popular because we have less prominent politicians and some mountains and cool geographical shit
We'll have your back when we rejoin
Could you explain it to me from Austria's POV
Yeah, I expect things wanting out of the UK would go Ireland or thr Netherlands tbh
Part of why claims we'd get it if we left the UK seemed
over optimistic
Why wouldn't they go with the two more obvious, proven nation states
And yeah, Ireland is a good source of animal productd
Think you also have a decent tech market for certain products
It really is
From a Scottish anti-brexiter's perspective, it would perhaps make the most sense to do that, but it ignores one crucial thing: national identity
Think about Armenia/Azerbaijan right now and the Balkans conflicts and everything else around national identity
What might make the most sense from an outside point of view may not outweigh what the people inside believe
Crucially, that identity will be strong enough for people to fight for
I have known people from NI that will tell you off for calling them Irish because they identify as British, I have known people that also don't give a fuck or would prefer unity
Remember there were people in Northern Ireland who voted for Brexit
So unification doesn't cater to their wants (although I bet they'd be significantly better off if it could happen peacefully)
Anyway this is just one Scot's perspective, and as someone who lives in the city which has bastardised Irish politics into a reason for football hooligans to stab each other, take my thoughts with a pinch of salt
There are political parties in Ireland for whom unification is a goal - with or without Brexit
Me and the boys going to Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch
Yeah Poland was and is doing a lot of undemocratic things but Hungary blocks any consequence (and vice-versa)
Sorry we left you in this shitshow then
I hope brexit has minimal effect on the EU
Yeah it's a shitshow
Even just knowing that I live in a country that voted against Brexit, yet we are getting dragged out anyway infuriates me
I can't imagine what it is like for the Republic of Ireland having no say whatsoever
You are absolutely right
Don't worry, I'm fully aware of how the vote was counted
I think it just highlights an ongoing political divide that often screws Scottish people over
Eg, we always have widespread yellow constituencies (for foreigners, the voting areas are almost all won by the left, pro indy Scottish National Party), yet we get Tory government in Westminster
I understand that that is how the system works, but in many ways its not working for us
Its crazy to vote for things, knowing a majority of your country will also vote your way, then still lose
Very true
I am thankful for devolution, especially given how we have education and health under our control
I think most Scots who are well versed on this topic will fully sympathise with all the English people having those feelings
I think the last decade has been significant for Scots, who've realised there may be better systems than what Westminster currently offers
Which would have been put to rest had Brexit - one of the BIGGEST reasons people voted against independence - not occurred
You're welcome to join us if it does ever happen
Perhaps I've just been really lucky but my experience with the NHS has been nothing but positive
I will say though that the mental health services here leave much to be desired
The NHS is so popular in the UK that the debates during elections are about which party is going to protect it best
A huge number of people voted for brexit because they were told "we send 350 million a week to the EU, let's give that money to the NHS instead".
The Conservative party want to dismantle the NHS and are currently in the process of doing it, but to get into power they have to say the complete opposite to the public
I totally agree the reasons for brexit are myriad and complex, I was just highlighting how all movements in the UK claim to be champions of the NHS to gain popularity because it's so universally seen as a good thing
In my opinion reducing funding to breaking point, adding more and more systems whereby the NHS must pay the private sector and has reduced bargaining power is the process by which you stealthily dismantle the NHS when you don't have the political capital to do it blatantly
I suppose they might be doing it by indifference rather than premeditation but the end result is the same
They fundamentally don't believe the state should provide people with services and act to reduce the instances of that happening wherever possible (except for nuclear weapons and aircraft carriers)
Irish
And probably Gaelic as well
Hungary tbh
I'm fairly certain for things like "knife" and "knight" the k was actually pronounced until it wasn't
Yeah, nothing wrong with it, just very confusing from my perspective
Yeah, the spelling, sentence structure and other grammar stuff
It's just pretty different from other European languages
I mean, Irish spelling still makes more sense than English, but I've gotten used to that one
The rise of Mussolini in Italy
Closer to home probably all (pre-1980s) wars involving Britain except WWI, WWII and the Scottish Wars of Independence
And Bonnie Prince Charlie’s Jacobites I suppose
For example I know next to nothing about the English Civil War, and how Scotland got involved
I'm really shocked no one from the UK has said the Irish famine and British-Irish relations in general
It's a completely whitewashed part of our history
The **only** thing I remember being told was that Ireland ran out of potatoes which caused people to starve, as if it was their fault (or as if that was anywhere close to the truth)
I'd say that in this area, it borders on the education system just lying to school pupils
Go to a pub in Glasgow, you’ll find plenty of Northern Irish history experts there
I suspect when they were using British and English interchangably, American-style
> Literally anything to do with Ireland - one of our closest neighbours and yet I don't think I learnt one thing about Ireland in school
I took history right to fourth year (so 15/16)
The only time Ireland was even mentioned for us was briefly mentioning that Ireland was exempt from concscription in the First World War
No mention as to why or anything
Thank you for this interesting write up
I definitely need to learn more about this
We did Hitler’s rise to power in high school but nothing about Italy
Yeah that’s how it was presented here
Rich central belt landowners kicking out poor highland tenants in favour of sheep farms
I suppose it makes sense that you learn it in NZ as that’s how so many Scots ended up down there
I don’t know much about the English education system I’m afraid
Scotland has its own independent system
Part of the terms of the 1707 Act of Union IIRC, along with keeping our own banknotes and courts/legal system
We don’t do GCSE’s up here, it’s Nat4/Nat5 (although I did Standard Grades under the old system) and Highers/Advanced Highers instead of A-levels
But we’re not taught anything about the Empire either
As a nation we like to paint ourselves as an imperial victim, which I think is shameful
Wear your orange Dutch national team shirt for the full effect
I’m not much better, most of my Irish history is from Ireland Simpsons Fans on Facebook and The Wind That Shakes the Barley
I can see how indoctrinating kids early would cause problems for a few generations at least
I don’t know much about the modern far-right in Italy beyond some Lazio fans and Mussolini’s granddaughter getting bullied by Celtic fans on twitter
Was much done to de-fascistify Italy after the war
Calling it the “Agricultural Revolution” is a bit annoying tbh
It’s known here as the Highland Clearances
Massive areas of Scotland were cleansed at the whim of a few rich landlords
To this day their descendants own much of the highland land
It was a destruction of highland culture as much as it was a financial decision
Even today Scotland is in dire need of land reform
We’re very proud of our ‘right to roam’ laws here, but they only exist because of our backwards land ownership rules
I could be talking shite, but I’m sure it was included in the act of union
I’m not sure how the current Scottish system teaches our imperial history (I left school in 2015) but we’re finally having a national conversation about our role in the slave trade, which is encouraging and long overdue
No need to skip mate, thank you for educating me
It varies a bit from place to place, but here's mine:
7 fifty minute periods a day on Mondays and Tuesdays, and 6 on Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays
We don't get any time to get to our classes, even though it can take up to 7 minutes to get from one side to another
We just sprint, haha
Try and make it to registration at 8:45 (my bus is always late lmao) and classes start at 9:00
1st period is 9:00-9:50, 2nd is 9:50-10:40, then 20 minutes for break
3rd period is 11:00-11:50, 4th is 11:50-12:40
On mon and tues, we would have 5th period after this, at 12:40-13:30, however during the rest of the week, lunch starts at that time
Lunch on mon and tues is 13:30-14:20
5th period is 13:30-14:20 (wed, thurs, fri), 6th is at 14:20-15:10
School ends on wed, thurs, fri, at 15:10, however we have a 7th period on mon and tues, at 15:10-16:00, meaning school ends at 16:00 then
As for actual classes, we can have double and triple periods
S1-3 have to have:
3 periods of PE (physical education),
1 of RMPS (religious, moral, philosophical studies),
2 french,
1 PSE (personal, social education)
S3s also have to pick a subject from each area of the curriculum
In S4, you're free to choose whatever
S4-5 have to have 3 PE, but nothing else
In S6, you don't have to take PE
You can drop out at the end of S4 or later
For high school:
Starts at 08:30
On Monday and Tuesday, There is 7 classes
On Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, There is 6 classes
Each class is 40 mins
Break is 15 mins
Lunch is 30 mins
Ends at 3:20 on Monday and Tuesday
Ends at 2:30 on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday
So my day started when I woke up at 7:30, bus (which went straight to school) at 8:05
Get into school for 8:35 start
Then registration (or regi) apart from on Mondays when we had assembly
Class would start at 9 and each period would be 40 minutes
Most classes would be doubles (1hr 20 mins) but some classes would be singles
Only in fifth and sixth year could you get triples and that was normally in very few circumstances
First three periods would run (9:00-9:40, 9:40-10:20, 10:20-11) then break would be 20 minutes till 11:20
Then there would be two more periods 11:20-11:55 and 11:55-12:35 which would be lunch
Then 40 minutes from 12:35-13:15 for lunch
Then triple period again running 13:15-13:55,13:55-14:35,14:35-15:15) finish meaning school ended at three 15
One day a week would be games day, (Tuesday) and Thursdays was extra games and Saturdays
Some clubs would also run like the cadets and debating society after school
Home for 4
Most days which I would walk home because I was less pressed for time unlike in the mornings
That fact was my highlight of my big green bus tour
In Scotland it has to be Hogmanay (our word for New Year’s Eve)
I know that every country has their own New Year traditions but for us it’s a whole different kettle of fish with wild public parties and where even house parties tend to spill into the general local environment
*Example of a note to neighbours when throwing such a party my family write:*.
*“On Hogmanay I am throwing a party at my flat upstairs
If the people and music are too loud and keeping you up, you are welcome to join us instead”. *
Then there’s the traditions of bringing people coal and exchanging gifts when you enter one another’s houses for the first time after midnight and the day of family dinners to the same extent as Christmas
I didn't even know what the queens jubilee was so I had to google it and I still don't even get it, I'm not so sure about that answer for the whole of the uk
In Scotland, that day happened yesterday
ohh, so that's what it's referring to
I thought it was on about a specific milestone for the amount of years she's been a queen, like once every 10 years or something
but yeah, if it's on about her birthday then this answer really doesn't fit here, I'd say only a very tiny population really cares at all about the queen or her birthday
are you sure
I really don't know anyone at all who celebrates it or even knows when this jubilee's meant to be, maybe it's just something that's very regional, but I find it really hard to think that it's celebrated by the majority
I lived in Gibraltar when I was a teenager and one of the traditions they took from Spain was the Three Kings Parade
I have been whacked in the face by far too many hard candies
I think they enjoy throwing them
[Scottish]
Fleeto
Best trackie wearers in Europe
I think there's something distinctly Scots about the musician Ewan Henderson
I can't quite pin down what it is, it's almost the slight look of surprise
That picture is spot on Spanish lol
I’d say Edinburgh more than anywhere else
Every year we have a giant summer festival that brings in hundreds of thousands of tourists, and even when that’s not on, most of the people you’ll see around the city centre are tourists
Glasgow city centre is often quite touristy too
The highlands are also full of campsites, hikes, rental holiday homes and pretty mountains, so they also tend to get somewhat swamped in the summer, particularly by tourists from England
The highlands (around Inverness and Fort William), Edinburgh and Glasgow
There’s a lot note beautiful areas (islands, further north, Grampians, Cairngorms, etc
), but I get why nobody really ‘explores’ the central belt
It’s just ex-mining towns, council estates and fields
Edinburgh, especially the royal mile
Biggest tourist trap in Scotland
Glasgow around Buchanan and Sauchiehall street too but not to the same degree
Definitely Edinburgh
In fact, during August it is almost impossible to do anything in Edinburgh because the Fringe festival is on
Obviously it's not on this year because of Covid
Was weird when I cycled through to Edinburgh on Saturday just past and it was dead in comparison to how it usually is this time
Glasgow gets nowhere near the level of tourists Edinburgh gets
(I don't have any stats to back that up, I'm just going off of my experiences of living in Glasgow)
Did you grow up in Dublin by any chance
Maybe the Spanish really like alcoves
Is this the right word, alcoves
I know but still more than pretty much anywhere else in the country (not including the places I already mentioned)
Saying that you are from Kent is probably more akin to saying you are from an American county, and most Brits won’t know those
We know our own counties because there are not that many of them and each has its own ‘identity’.
I would say each state is more comparable to a country
I mean perhaps you don’t know every country in Europe but you probably know most of them
Yeah I would say the average person has heard of most of the 50 States
Obviously if you said I'm from Burlington Vermont people might not know exactly where it is but they have heard of the state
That's not weird
I go on pretend road trips all the time
Oh, maybe I'm weird
> But, tbh, people probably already knew you were from the US the moment you spoke, just like they would for any other English-speaking country
Worth noting, quite a lot of people have subtler accents so it's not always a good thing to trust accents, given the number of Irish and Scottish people with subtler accents that foreigners read as English (doesn't get mistaken as much by actually English people) and a fair few Americans have subtle enough accents that I've assumed they were British until they specified otherwise
It's a very imprecise and often misleading using just accents
>British counties can be more difficult as they can usually believably be English, Scottish or Irish
Oh, the poor Welsh
Quick quiz: d'ya know the UK's four home nations
That is true, but many of them are based on historical counties and they have similar names
Yorkshire is not a single county anymore, but most people have an idea where it is and it definitely has an identity
Where I fall down personally is London boroughs, Welsh and Northern Irish counties
I know some but not all
Probably worth specifying, the UK isn't currently federal, there have been pushes to federalise it, but its never happened
There is a weird system due to how it formed from several well developed countries, never really fully integrating them (the Scottish legal system never really merged with the English one, etc), and the idea of being a country of co-equal nations (something similar to, IDK, Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, theoretically an equal partnership)
So it can look like a weird federalisation due to that, continuing national identities (most Scots, Welsh, and Emglish identify as Scots, Welsh, or English, not British in the census), and the devolved parliaments and assemblies
We have a really weird system due to the really weird history of these isles
Correct
Just since that's never a given, despite being you'd think one of the more accessible ones
At least I wouldn't hear you say 'this is such a lovely part of England' on a train in Scotland :D
My pals learning a bit of greek and he's struggling with it a lot lol
I'm not happy I'm getting dragged out
Yes
Although desperately sad that my country (Scotland) is being dragged out of the EU by a neighbour (England)
I miss it already :(</3
Fuck yes
Being dragged out of it, but hopefully Scotland will rejoin
It's almost as if the slow, pragmatic, negotiated, compromising centrism of the EU really does, on the whole, result in decent, acceptable, sensible outcomes
I'd love to, just make a pint much less than £8 and we're sorted
> generally it is hard to track
Surely not
We track who votes already in the UK by having their names marked off a sheet in a polling station when they turn up to vote
The only difference is they'd have much larger lists, and fines would be issued to the names not checked off at the end of the day
Very similar to the typical American ones
Probably some more pro communist ones than America though
The scary one for me is homeopathy as it's achieved a degree of official and royal support
No you haven't
The Scots Wikipedia is a bit of a laughing stock, as it appears the vast majority of it was created by an American teenager who didn't actually speak Scots
It didn't really make a difference as most Scottish people would read and write in English in formal/factual communication and only use Scots informally amongst themselves
(Which is also why the Scots Wikipedia problems went unspoken about until Rian raised it)
Well there was a Scots version of Wikipedia but it was barely comprehensible so I can’t really speak to the information accuracy
this doesn't really fit 100% since (in my opinion) scots isn't a language on its own, but there is a scots wikipedia which some American teen started iirc and he literally just used some online scots dictionary to translate some words, and if he couldn't find a translation he would just type it out in what he thought a scottish accent sounded like
He had been doing this for absolute years, dismissed actual scottish people telling him he was just typing what was basically broken English and edited thousands of articles
[Here's] the reddit post that sort of blew it up if anyone's interested
It is a bit of a shame because people are guessing he has autism, because there's no way your typical person is going to be obsessed with anything to the degree he was
Scotland: tap water is pure quality
You’d only drink bottle water if you were out and about and parched
Scotland’s got surprisingly clean tap water so as a kid I never understood pre-bottled water
Still think it’s a scam
I live in Scotland and in the UK all tap water is 100% potable by design and infrastructure
The quality of said water varies drastically by location
For example:
An old acquaintance of mine from the Highlands and Islands in Scotland came to Edinburgh and found the water difficult to stomach slightly at first, because theirs came literally from the freshest and most beautiful streams
Perfect water
I grew up in Edinburgh and I drink tap water like it’s the nectar of the gods
It’s beautiful, clear, cold and refreshing straight from the tap
It’s extremely hard water and comes from the local hills
That old acquaintance of mine once visited London and threw up when he tasted it
He couldn’t at all
I visited London a year later and while I spent 10 minutes gagging trying to get it down
It was vile
We both ended up drinking bottled during our stays
All the water is drinkable and a lot of people do, and while all water is equal, some waters are more equal than others
Yes, it wasn’t until a few years ago I realised it wasn’t the norm in other countries
It was crazy to me
You get free tap water at restaurants too
Yea, it's very clean here in Scotland
You can get it in restaurants for free, why pay for clean water when we have it straight from the Highlands to our taps
Yep, since we’re up north, our tap water is surprisingly nice
Yeah, I got so into the habit of just asking for a glass of tap water when I’m out that I did the same in Spain and the waiter gave me such a weird look
Correct
I absolutely fucking grudge having to buy water
If I do buy a bottle for the car or motorbike, that bottle gets refilled until it falls to bits haha
Is it hard water
I’m pretty sure all of Scotland has very soft water especially when compared to England
I’ve just got myself a thermal water bottle
Best thing I’ve done in ages
Don’t even uses glasses now
Come back hours later and the waters as cold as if it just came out the babbling brook
For the village that I live in:

local council in my area sold a lorry park for like under  £5k that they realised they need and is now paying more than £1k a month for it
probably catholic vs protestant sectarianism
Same here in the UK
Fucking crackpots
I always feel rather self conscious as a 20s British man whenever I visit, well pretty much anywhere in Europe that isn't one of the large rich countries for this reason
Same, but for Scotland, Edinburgh and Glasgow are always visited, but no one visits my random town in the middle of bum fuck nowhere
We have a hill, and some shops, and a hotel somewhere, I think
Yeah I think I probably get treated better than my English friends but still I'm an English speaker
Murcia
I had it in my head it was a region, not a city
Duisburg, Germany
I'm quite pleased I made it that far down to be honest
The next one after that is Szczecin, Poland
\#66 Bochum, Germany
At least it's 9 more than in the US
Kept going and second unknown was #88 Karlsruhe, Germany
Also didn't know #92 Craiova, Romania
The list ended just one after that though
I have a friend who sings it at karaoke, can confirm it is the only reason I have heard of Lodz
A lot of speakers have started using the dative pronouns instead of the genitive ones in many cases, or will rephrase sentences to use dative constructions
The canonical example is:
Wegen des Wetters (Genitive) vs
wegen dem Wetter (Dative)
It's so widespread that there is a book about contentious issues in German grammar, orthography etc
that's entitled (tongue firmly in cheek) "Der Dativ ist dem Genitiv sein Tod" (literally - "the dative is to the genitive its death"), rather than "Der Dativ ist der Tod des Genitivs" ("The dative is the death of the genitive")
>to finally create a large and unique European state
Do most people even want that
The two general things would be the cultural heritage of Roman influence and Christianity but those things are far from unique to Europe

In the UK, If you see a Scottish man with a bow and arrow in the city of York
You are legally allowed to shoot them
Oh boy here we go
You are legally allowed to kill a scotsman with a bow in York
Not allowed to hold salmon suspiciously
Gambling is banned in public libraries
Coming into the house of commons with armour is illegal
As an MP you are legally not allowed to resign
Sugar Tax
If someone knocks on your door needing the toilet you must let them use it in Scotland
Irn Bru tastes awful, Pepsi tastes awful, Coke tastes awful and sweeteners are actually suspected that they are worst than sugar
"Lairig Ghru" is pronounced almost like "Larry Groo", so nope for gaelic
Just "the toilet"
Thistle is a great one to test non native English speakers
It gets the tongue moving and lots really struggle the 'th' anyway
"it's a braw nicht but the morns gan tae blaw a hoolie"
Or get them to pronounce "kirkgunzeon" and "Kirkcudbright".
I had friends from poland many years ago, and they really tried their best to get me talking polish
I learned some very basic stuff, and then the entirety of that poem
I’ve been told that my pronunciation is very good, and I am endlessly proud of that
Chrzaszcz remains my favourite word in polish) I have to omit the special a cause iphone keyboard has everything but that apparently
Loch too, though not for any language that has the hard ch sound as well
Place names are great for non-scots
Milngavie trips people up not just for the spelling
Also never met an American who could pronounce Edinburgh straight off the bat
Nope
More names with the same energy: Gloucestershire, Leicestershire
> Also fuck Yorkshire accents
They're my second favourite English (as in, from England) accent, after the West Country accent (also known as "pirate speech", they do the yarrs and arrrrs)
Sauchiehall Street anaw a lot of folk struggle with
Americans also find Glasgow difficult
Always say it Glas-gow instead of just Glas-go
In my experience, Americans from the Northeast manage to pronounce Worcester accurately, because Worcester is also a town in Massachusetts
Tbf the way -shire is pronounced nowadays is also butchering the "proper" (original) pronunciation
Our ancestors would be quite horrified by the way we say it
In Scotland we often use the endearing term of cunt,
"What's up cunts"
Any sort of swear works
Cunt, dickhead, arsehole, fucker, fuck head etc
The list is truly endless
“Mucker” is a slightly outdated word for friend, associated with Londoners but used and understood more widely than that
It’s probably the same word as “Makker”
I was wondering about the exact same thing
Lots of trade/contact between the East coast of England and the Low Countries over the centuries
(I don't recall hearing 'mucker' in Scotland, though
Mucker is common in Glasgow, or it used to be
I always thought it was someone you mucked about with, but maybe the derivation went the other direction, ie makker->mucker->muck about
Darling: ‘If it is true sir, we’ll have to cancel the push’
Melchett: ‘Exactly’
George: ‘damn’
Blackadder: ‘What a nuisance’
Melchett: ‘Exactly what the enemy would expect us to do and therefore exactly what we shan’t do’
Blackadder: ‘Ah now’
That team should never have been at the World Cup ireland should have gone Thierry Henry is a cheating bastard
Also worth mentioning that Ireland left the Commonwealth
In Iraq I met an Italian military captain who said he was a knight of Malta
I don't know whether it was true, but I have no reason not to believe him
He was a good fellow; he kept us supplied with wine
The Commonwealth is a fairly useful organisation
In my work (on democracy and development in the global south) I've had dealings with the Commonwealth Secretariat, the Commonwealth Judges and Magistrates Association and the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association - all of which do good work promoting democratic institutions and norms, the rule of law, human rights etc
The more subtle influences of the Commonwealth include scholarships (when I was working in the South Pacific, I met several people who received university education through Commonwealth funds) and cultural exchanges (there's an association for Commonwealth writers, for example)
Now you mention it, I think there might have been
I've met plenty of Spanish scouts, so there must be some -
I've met Russian scouts, so you must have something similar
In Europe
Where do you think they started :o
I'm really shocked at that
Scouting worldwide has always had a really strong following across Europe
It really shocks me to see people think that the USA scouts are representative when they're *so* different to the rest of the planet
Yeah that page has indicative numbers and they're tiny
The biggest group has fewer members than Scouts Scotland, and as a country we're about a tenth of the size
Yeah, I understand that, it's just a big surprise to me
I would have thought that Spanish people would know more about neighbouring countries I guess
Do you think it changes massively, regionally
There's loads here in central Scotland, parts of the Antonine wall, some bath houses and stuff like that
Areas like Bearsden, Cumbernauld and I think Kilsyth have preserved their roman sites and have plaques up to explain what you're looking at
Schools are named after saints martyred by the Romans (well the catholic ones are), streets have names like Antonine Way and Roman Road
It's not uncommon to find roman items if they're excavating fields for housing development
Yes Hadrian's wall being most famous, then maybe the Antonnine wall
They didn't come up too far because there wasn't much here

So myself and my Polish ex were in creperie in Paris, waitress didn't have English but we persevered and got the food we wanted
Mid meal another waitress came in for a shift change and both her and our previous waitress turned out to be Polish
We all had a good laugh about it
A Ukrainian women started speaking Russian to me in a bar in Berlin
I was very confused and told her I only speak English she said ‘I’m sorry I thought you were Russian, you have a very Russian face’.
It was very strange as I’ve never thought I looked Slavic at all and the only nationalities I’ve been guessed as in the past are English, Irish (both of which are pretty common for Scots) and German
I guess this woman’s East Slav radar is faulty
I have lightish brown hair but this is the most common colour in the UK as well
I have quite high cheekbones but they’re not wide
Also I’m slightly freckled and I thought this was less common in Slavic peoples
Maybe I look more Russian than I’d previously thought though
I think this is pretty much exclusively an American problem
Cumber fucking nauld it's basically a monument to the "brutalist" architecture of the 50s/60s and has won the worst city in Scotland more than 3 times

Drumchapel, Scotland
I'm just happy no one is bullying Inverness, if I'm honest
Blandest, most boring, soulless
I'm not sure, I've liked most cities I've been to, they usually have something that makes me interested
The only one I just felt a bit hollow visiting and leaving was Basel, but that was first day in Switzerland and overcast, so it just felt
meh
That said, definitely not a fair evaluation, but it is the city I've actually had a potter about in a felt the most underwhelmed
I wasn't there for long so I can't say fot sure but I couldn't see any soul in Antwerp
Glenrothes
Yous have never been to Arkhangelsk I'm guessing
I did and that was the "yeah I've had enough Russia for a while" moment for me
Stirling
This town is coming like a ghost town
I loved Linz when I visited but it helped that my best mate had already been there for two months on Erasmus so he had time to explore
There was a tiny Irish pub down a lane off the Hauptplatz (the old Dubliner I believe it was called) and it was great
The Christmas Market was also great because it's nowhere near as crowded as the ones in the bigger cities (such as Innsbruck)
The Apfelpunsch was delightful as well
I also enjoyed walking up to the look out on the hill that overlooks the Danube
&nbsp;
It would be nice if Celtic were to draw LASK in the next round of the Europa League as it would give me an excuse to go back to Linz
> and cancel all incoming Ryan Air flights
Good thing that EasyJet still exist ;)
Yeah I agree with you
I got the impression that it was very much a living city but with a lot of amazing landmarks and a beautiful old town
It helped that I got some time to explore the city myself since my mate had classes to go to during the week
I get what you're saying about the Old Dubliner getting crowded, it's tiny
Oh and I forgot to mention that I took the Pöstlingbergbahn up to the Pöstlingberg-Kirche
That was beautiful as well
&nbsp;
You never know, if LASK don't beat Sporting CP in the last group game then there's definitely a chance that we draw each other
Until then, have an apfelpunsch for me at the markets :)
Scotland does for Scottish and EU citizens however we're not EU for long sadly
Depending on the course, it might be worth checking out Malta - one of the two countries in the EU (other than Ireland) where English is an official language
It has a good university for some subjects, less so for others
At 10K a year for "international" students, I doubt it
However as this is Scotland and we're lovers of our EU neighbours, perhaps we'll shimmy a wee gig for them
It's always nice not to take a loan if you dont have to
You're still saving money
Well you're basically saying "I'll make enough after graduation that I can pay this off easily"and that's a completely fair bargain to make but if you can work during uni and do the same then why not
Eh I'm not sure about that
In the UK even Scotland where uni is free and student loans are easy to get most people still have a job  for at least a night or two a week (though most people still get a loan too)
Its completely understandable if that's not what you want though
Empty bottles, they’re just laying around everywhere, broken glass too
Views of the Scottish highlands, they’re pretty cheap if you go from Scotland
Irn Bru is way cheaper as, one it’s sold on mass here
To it’s only really big market is here and 3 it’s made here
One of my favourites is Tattybogle
A useful translation is scarecrow, a literal translation is Potato Ghost
Bawbag = Ballbag which means Ballsack
Gaelic
Damhan-allaidh meaning fierce little stag (spider)
The thing about English is that it's such a mongrel, doggerel language, and so widely spoken as a second language - sometimes by people who don't speak it well well - that you can mangle it almost any way and it still more or less makes sense
Deer perhaps
With their love of randomly crossing roads and getting hit by cars, causing accidents and sometimes biting and chasing people who think it'd be fun to feed them
They're also extremely dangerous to the environment
I was sceptical but it seems deaths by dogs are comparable to cows (which kill 3 a year)
[The British Deer Society claims] that 10 people are killed each year in deer-related traffic accidents, but they seem to be a lobby group for the game industry so aren't exactly a reliable source
[Check out their latest news lmao]
In a basic sense in most republics (those without monarchies) the president is the head of state who does ceremonial things like opening new infrastructure projects or welcoming foreign dignitaries
Whereas the prime minister is the one who leads the executive branch of government that makes decisions
It wasn't common before, but I wouldn't be surprised if some government bodies choose to do it now as a statement of opposition to brexit
Well if I had a garden, I'll be flying it
Cannot wait until we re-join
I think the Scottish government flies it outside government buildings alongside the Scottish flag too
Banning flags would set an ill precedent
The UK government complains about the Scots Government flying the EU flag, but all they do is get pet journalists to write angry newspaper columns
The EU and Council of Europe share a flag, and the UK remains a member of the Council of Europe, so *technically* it's still a valid flag to fly, although any local authority flying it is almost certainly showing support for rejoining the EU
Trainspotting
Trainspotting
For Scotland I'd recommend Filth, Angels' Share, or Neds
I would have also included Trainspotting, but it's more likely people have already seen this, and the others are less likely to have been seen
Restless Natives
The Angel's Share
That sinking feeling
Bill Forsyth Scotland's greatest director
Also local hero

Trainspotting is up there, but for lesser known examples try Walter Wants To Kill Himself or even Slow West which is set in the USA but with Scottish characters and director

One of the best films ever made to be honest with you
Such a good film
I can vividly remember at least three scenes from that film
The bit with the carp, the plastic glasses and whether halušky are gnocchi
Love that

I just remember it being weird

Is this when everyone invades west minster
Only to save us from aliens that have been fucking us over fir the last 50 years
Only to find Churchill locked in a closet
The queen is the head of state; PM is the head of government
I think she's better than Boris Johnson in pretty much every way
She has lead Scotland through covid in more decisive and skillful way
The only reason why I wouldn't want her as PM is because of Scottish independence
While I am a supporter of independence I think if we had a competent, more left-wing government I'd be more open to the idea of only having more devolution but there is the risk of a government like the current one being elected again
Which is a risk I wouldn't want to take
Yeah I'd agree to that but I think we'd be best of getting out while we still can and hopefully rejoining the EU
No genders, and one word for ‘the’. How batshit crazy the spellings and rules are without necessarily acknowledging that if you’re a native speaker
The amount of dialect words used for different things
Or how the question ‘Alright
’ isn’t necessarily a question, and not always asking if you are alright
Fair enough is great at ending conversations though
Haggis, mainly because it's got a sheep's heart, liver and lungs in it which I don't think is as weird/disgusting as people make it out to be
It does actually taste good though, especially on a roll imo
It's traditionally served with mashed neeps (turnips) and tatties/totties (potatoes),
Haggis is delicious and if you disgaree you're a cunt
Haggis, I think we all know what that is by now
Or a deep fried mars bar (chocolate bar)
Haggis gets loads of shite but I think it's really good
Haggis - Meat in a sheep bladder (or artificial packaging) along with oats and suet/spices
Square/Lorne Sausage - Minced meat mixed with oats and rusks and some traditional spices
You fry it on a pan with some oil and then put it in a roll (either crispy or morning roll) with lots of butter
Cranachan - A desert with some whisky, some oats, some strawberries and double cream
Pudding, meaning types of sausages comes from the French word boudin
Try living in Western Scotland
We might have some *daylight*, but the vast majority of the time it's an overcast nightmare
Glasgow gets about 1203h of sunshine per year, vs 1821h in Stockholm, 1780h I  Copenhagen, 1660h in Oslo, and even Reykjavik gets more at 1268h.
By choice
It is the cheese sandwich of countries: boring, but predictable
So much of south eastern Europe
Always on the borderlands of empires, but also with it's own unique diverse cultures as well
Scotland has lots of history, but with a singular external protagonist/antagonist; the swirling currents and changes of South Eastern European history are so much more interesting by comparison
Transylvania - so much more to it than vampire legends
Hanseatic League - not one place, but a whole network of autonomous city-republics that have a fascinating but often overlooked role in Northern European history
I know a little history of Latvia it's not great in a lot of bits
The siege of Malta during the Second World War is an incredible story, especially Operation Pedestal and the SS Ohio
*Three Elegies for Kosovo* is one of my favourite books as well, so slim, so few words, and yet so much said
If you haven't read it already, I recommend Kadere's *The Three Arched Bridge*, it has a very similar style and atmosphere to his Kosovo book
Can thank the church for some of the lack of interest too I'd think
There's Ae in Dumfries and Galloway
Not too sure if this counts but I think it might,in Scotland,the Gaelic name for the town iona is 'Ì',however our shortest place name in English is the village of Ae in Dumfries and Galloway
[Iona] is technically the shortest in gaelic as it’s sometimes called ì. The English one with the shortest is [Ae]
[E] a river in the Highlands
Another fun twinning- I grew up in the hamlet (population 81) of Dull in Scotland
When my mum’s friend was driving across the West of the US, she came across the town of Boring in Oregon
My mum brought the idea of twinning to the community council, and long story short, Dull and Boring are now twinned
She really had her 15 minutes of fame with that one lmao, she was getting constant requests for interview from news stations from all over the world for a week or so
People from both places have journeyed over to the other and it’s a proper twinning now
The town of Bland in Australia has also asked if they can take part
Yea so I guess technically there’s two
My Spanish wife and Italian neighbour could do the same - although occasionally they would both lapse into English
In the brazilian portuguese Harry Potter translation, all the given names with a clear equivalent were translated into their portuguese version, except the main 3 characters
But pretty much everyone else did (James = Tiago, Lily = Lílian, Remus = Remo, Bill = Gui, Oliver = Olívio)
So you get a lot of weird sounding phrases with a bunch of portuguese names being used for characters in a series full of british culture, town names and etc
I feel huge sympathy with the people of Paris for their cultural loss, as well as a sadness at the destruction of a famous and beautiful building, but no personal sense of losing anything
I used to play football with a guy who had posted in an Instagram pic with his girlfriend yesterday afternoon outside the Notre Dame, literally just a few hours before it went of fire
We'll sometimes use a sarcastic comment to someone meant in a friendly, mild rebuke, which seems to offend - or just generally confuse - folk from other cultures
For example, if you came in late to work, your boss might say, "the clocks changed weeks ago, min".
Howdy neighbourino
Or neighbourinalainen I guess
Bilingual people, do you feel you "change" or "adapt" parts of your personality when speaking different languages
I've lived in Brazil for over a decade and recently a brazilian friend of mine told me that my whole body language changes when he saw me speaking english with my dad
It's not the first time I was told something like that, and I've noticed my wife does it as well when she speaks japanese with her family
I do think that ESL people quite often swear a bit more than native English speakers, not all the time or in or places but I think it is a thing
I "toned down" my accent when speaking english with brazilians or americans since most people in my experience didn't understand me at all if I went full Glasgow while talking to them
But every time I visited Scotland while living overseas it would always come back pretty quickly
In fairness, I sometimes don't understand Glasweigins when they go full Glasgow in the Highlands
The look of visible relief when my Maltese friend discovered I didn't speak Glasgow is something that will stick with me for a while
Good on you man for not doubling down and trying to help people understand ya
Interesting, fiance is Creole-Cajun and is pathologically opposed to swearing
Would have assumed Canadian French were the same
someone's edited that clip to make it sound like absolute garble, but it's still funny as fuck
I find Germans and the Dutch to be very direct sometimes - I used to work for a company with a lot of management from both countries, it made for some very unambiguous communication which I really appreciated
Some people found it a little abrasive though
Edinburgh certainly is hated by Glaswegians, Dundonians, Aberdonians, Invernesians and indeed everyone else
But fuck them we're the capital
Edinburgh is sort of liked
Maybe a bit of rivalry between them and Glasgow, but aside from that its mostly liked, from my experience
Joked and mocked as being poshos, but it's generally a nice city to most
Dundee (Scumdee
) and Glasgow are ripped into more
Probably impossible to have a capital that is universally liked by all portions of the country, though
But I can't think of any intense hatred towards Edinburgh
> Edinburgh
Salt and sauce wankers, they can get tae fuck

Scottish independence is VERY different to Irish unification, which could not happen without a lot of bloodshed
The paramilitaries which fought in the troubles are still armed
It's not really that common to speak a second language here but I don't think anyone really cares
Then again Scots is considered a language to some people (I'd say more so a dialect) but there's still people who put it down as lower class slang
That's a bit harsh lol
> Anyway, if you want to come here for a year or so, english is all you need
If you want to live here for the rest of your life, we appriciate you learning Dutch
This the Catch-22 of the Netherlands: You can live here for x years speaking only English, but if you want to live here for x+1 years, you are suddenly expected to speak fluent Dutch, which you are supposed to have learned automatically without ever being able to practice it
England's contributions to modern music
The Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Queen, etc
Though it's a mostly joint effort by Irish/UK television but Father Ted is by far one of Ireland's greatest exports
It’s a difficult decision between Katie Hopkins and Nigel Farage
Honestly one of the people who spreads vile hatred on twitter
Maybe like Katie Hopkins because she's not even clever she's just daft
Scotland - Katie Hopkins
The UK - Shawn Mendes (just to annoy my pal)
If the Americans would like keep that odious little scrote Nigel Farage confined to their country now that's he fucked off over there again that'd be great
Aye I imagine it's fucking back breaking to whip out a wave to the peasants from her ***literal palace*** every now and then
Slightly different in Scotland
If you want to change your name in Scotland, you can just do it, providing it's not for the purposes of deceit or fraud
No paperwork required
If you want to have it recorded officially you do this by statutory declaration, which can be done by a notary public or a justice of the peace
Note that this only applies to people who were born or adopted in Scotland
If you were born elsewhere you have to go through the process of the country you were born in

>tfw I now remember that the HMS Warspite was scrapped instead of being preserved as a museum ship

The Royal Navy was the pride of the UK for centuries, our sword and shield, and we didn't preserve a single battleship from World War II :(
It’s an occasional pub quiz question
eh doesnt really bother me
there doing there best
No annoying
If am in my own city and someone walks up to me trying to speak English al be able to help them and obviously wouldn’t be annoyed at them trying
Majority of the time the persons English will be better than my knowledge of their language
Probably difficulty to answer for English speakers given how widely spoken English is in Europe
Which is huge luck given how poor and lazy British people are with languages in general
But anyone getting annoyed by something like that is a wee tadger
I speak a bit of French (or I used to), but my listening comprehension is poor at normal speeds
I haven’t had much success at getting French people to speak v e r y   s l o w l y  to give me a chance to understand them
We always end up speaking English, and I’m always disappointed
When the roles are reversed and I’m at my work speaking to foreign tourists or workers I adjust my accent and vocabulary and speak slowly
Even competent speakers would struggle otherwise
Most definitely whiskey and haggis maybe a bit of shortbread too
Reddit loves weed which makes it biased
Yeah but there should be limits to it so you can't smoke it all day every day
Yes though it's a lot more dangerous than what a lot of the current culture likes to admit
Also it shouldn't be taxed, that's just a bad idea
It makes the state partially dependent on drug sales
Yeah, as long as it's regulated it's safe

Used to think I lived about 10 mins away from the English border when infact I live about 2 hours away if theres minimal traffic
That's not that much of a stretch
Sinai was occupied by Israel for 15 years, and Chechnya was de facto independent as well for most of the 90s.
Exactly what I'd expect from Prussians
In fairness, for quite a while it essentially was, iirc, due to fortified border with Francoist Spain
It's also a British Overseas Territory, so not a terrible assumption, even if inaccurate
Don't worry about it
I'm lucky enough to live across the street from a coffee roaster, but if I really like Marcilla (Spanish brand) and Delta coffee from Portugal
This looks good, and for a coffee machine it's really cheap
I've dated girls from Spain, Italy and Poland
With the Spanish and Italian girls, there was definitely quite a large humour disconnect
I found I had to make jokes really obvious and clownish to make it known I was telling a joke; the Polish girl was a lot more comfortable with the Scots way of trying to be funny
> In the Uk it’s really not all that special to have a threesome or even open up your relationship when it’s long distance
Isn't it
You'd have to have a sense of humour if you came from Paisley
Well, it sure as hell wasn't my looks
I never found quite the same issue with Germans or Scandinavians, sometimes they didn't get it, but I also found that they were very good at pretending they didn't get it in order to turn a deadpan joke back on you (and I fell for it multiple times
With Spanish folk, it was almost like having to pick up a megaphone and shout "this is a joke
YOU WILL NOW LAUGH, BECAUSE THIS IS A JOKE". I'm maybe being a bit judgemental, but it meant the Spanish sense of humour came across as quite childish to me
> .i think they also find it harder to laugh at themselves on the continent
I think this is broadly true, but I think northern Europeans are generally better at laughing at themselves than southern Europeans
Ach, maybe I'm just conservative
I can imagine the threesomes being more common than I thought, but opening-up in a long-distance relationship surprises me a lot, to be honest
Someone from Paisley absolutely does *not* sound Doric
(Sorry, I'm from the north east, where we do speak Doric, and to us, Paisley folk sound very different, much closer to Glaswegian in dialect)

We're quite self-depricating, we like to mock arrogance and people that take themselves too seriously, and a lot of the humour comes from quick, witty comments and mocking each other
The jokes tend to be quite deadpan, and the humour can tend towards the dark (we're slowly moving away from the old "be racist and homophobic and just pretend it's dark humour" pish)
The sketch-show *Burnistoun* is probably good "starter-pack" to get an idea of what Scots find funny
I think you're right, language makes a huge difference, but I do also think there's a cultural element as well
>I think not
We have a good bunch of sad humor jokes about italy
I always pictured brits or other ex colonial countries as less good in self deprecation humor because they still felt their colonial past, that “we are superior”, that “fallen noble” thing
I wasn't talking about the country, rather the individual
And, in my experience, the worst ex-colonial country for the "fallen noble" thing is definitely Spain
I just find Northern Europeans are more likely to mock themselves, whereas Southern Europeans are much more likely to take themselves seriously as an individual
It's not even an arrogance thing - once your ear is tuned to it, you realise that brits can demonstrate arrogance through self-deprecation - e.g., I mind a really posh english person telling me, "I didn't go anywhere special for university, just a nothing-little-backwater town on the road from London to Birmingham".  That was their way of boasting they'd been to Oxford University
They were absolutely trying to show-off, but making sure to be seen to be using self-deprecation as they did it
I'm Scottish, so not my "language", but I learned Castillian Spanish quite well during my teens and ended up sharing a flat with an Argentinian girl once
She was always horrified when I used the verb "coger" in everyday language chatting with her
Eventually she had to tell me to stop as in her dialect it meant "to fuck" instead of "to take" and I was effectively going around talking about fucking her and other mundane things
Generational focus is just America's way of not allowing people to talk about class and economic inequality
But I'll tell you one thing: millenials in the 1% are not spending all their money on avocado toast, failing to get on the property ladder, or struggling to pay student debts while underemployed in the gig economy
Yep
It's a load of fucking shite
Everyone blaming the generation up/down for things that were ultimately caused by rich people, hurting us all
Thank god it doesn't seem to be a thing here
Yeah, and everyone born between 1980 and 1996 has the same beliefs, ethics, philosophies, interests, tastes, behaviours etc
The Battlefield at Culloden (near Inverness) has a really creepy reputation
The last battle on British soil was fought there in 1746, concluding the jacobite rebellions
Rebel troops were massacred as they attempted to charge across marshland to reach the government troops
Many more were killed as they tried to escape
The battlefield is eerie, the birds dont sing there and people are always reporting paranormal happenings
Hartwood Hospital
Opened in 1895 and was once the largest psychiatric asylum in Europe and the first place in Scotland to perform a lobotomy, among many other controversial therapies and procedures
It's been abandoned for years now, but people often make it past the guards
Hermitage castle is one of the creepiest places I have ever been to, its in the middle of nowhere and the whole place gives off a weird vibe
It has a lot of bad history with people starving each other to death and torturing people
Although there are absolutely dozens of creepy/haunted places in Scotland
[Hermitage Castle]
[Haunted Places in Scotland]
In Scotland, it’s practically used as punctuation
Generally not a massive deal
Don't say around kids, etc
That said, remember it is a swear
Which sounds obvious, but you do occasionally see people who are non-native speakers here and abroad just throw the word 'fuck' around like it's an 'um' or something, to fill space, and that is going to be looked down upon or at least grate upon people (even if those people are ok with curses)
Really, be like using your own swears: context is key and just remember that they can be offensive, so don't throw them out with every other breath
If you swear in front of a child/school teacher/parents yes and if you use it directed at someone "fuck you," fuck off" yeah
Otherwise nah ya silly cunt
Dunno about England but noone in Scotland gives a fuck
From my experience in England they are more partial to words lik ‘bloody’ ‘bleeding’ or ‘heck’ etc etc
British =/= English
Very location dependant
England is more uptight overall than the rest of the UK but you'll find your areas it's much more okay than others
Nah fuck that   ^
"Cheers cunt, this shits fucking sick" is a perfectly acceptable parting phrase once you've picked up something nice off Oxford Street
Northern Americans are touchy about swearing or "cursing" haha
bleeding commonly heard in bath, bristol and outer london
heck in the south west and south
but yes i imagine it is a geographic thing
also a generational thing
a lot of older folk tend to avoid swearing i find
Truth
Also the
... The South
Shit in English is your excrement
So if something is shit, shitty or shite (last one is British English, particularly Scottish) then you're giving it the attribute of or being like what you flushed down the toilet earlier that morning
By itself however it's just another curse word but that's what your shit is
London and some of the area around it you're maybe alright but the rest of the South
I repeat:
>I do reckon Glasgow wins though
And with that I'll take my leave, cheers cunts
No, with "poop" people are gonna look at you like your mental age is a bit
Behind
Whereas "shit" is a swear word here and over in NA so you'll be looked at like you've just said a curse word in public
a burn
English (kind of) does it too
It's just we disguise it by putting spaces in the middle of our compound words
I think it's a bit of a generational divide here: I've been able to have fairly open conversations with people around my age (20-40) however it becomes a less open field at ages above that
It's almost like you were never to talk about it before for whatever reason but it helps you to gauge what people make in whatever the job is that they do so you have an idea what's out there
Bragging obviously isn't cool but that's going to be the person, not the money
I think the real question here is who has conversations around water fountains
I've seen a mostly equal mix between black and green olives here
Yeah kids walked or cycled too and from school by them self or in a group of kids from about age 9 or 10
Depends on how far away it is and how young they were
I was walking to school without my parents when I was 5, but I lived quite close to the school
Yes especially teens they walk around like they own the place
This is actually a really interesting question from a Scottish perspective, because much of our slang and dialect is taken from old Scots, rather than old English
History lesson since most of you are probably very unfamiliar with Scots: Scots is a splinter of old English that diverged from its cousin around the 12th century, and became the dominant language in the lowlands and, to a lesser extent, the highlands (before this both regions where largely dominated by Gaelic, with the odd pocket of Norse remaining in the at-the-time Norwegian territories)
Over the years, Scots and English kind of merged to create what I’ll call Modern Scots, which is what’s spoken in the majority of Scotland today, but there are still many areas where the dialect people speak borrows a hell of a lot more from Scots than English
What’s curious about Scots is that it hasn’t really changed that much over the centuries, particularly in the last 250 years or so in which the works of Rabbie Burns have been extremely popular
A modern Scots speaker could have never heard of Burns (unlikely as it is), and yet would probably be able to read *Tae a Moose* perfectly
‘The best-laid schemes o’ Mice an’ Men
Gang aft agley,
An’ lea’e us nought but grief an’ pain,
For promis’d joy
Love that line from Tae a Moose
Also where the book ‘Of Mice and Men’ gets its name
I love comparing Scots to Norse languages, so many similarities
Bairn, Kirk, flit, mucke, braw, etc
Even that weird inhaling way teuchters (beautiful Scots word) say yes/aye they do in Sweden
Sometimes I forget just how *old* Greece is
Most of the comments on here are talking about languages going back 500-1000 years, but here you guys are talking about languages 3 times older than that
Makes more sense than 'a shoot'. English sucks
No we don't have one
But our drivers license has kinda become the defacto ID card for people here
We don't really have one although people have been debating one for the last 20 years
The closest I can think of is a young scot card which you can use to get discounts on things as a young person which just has your DOB, face etc but nothing national
Stirling, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Glasgow and Glasgow again
Edinburgh probably was the biggest city in Scotland, until the 19th century when Glasgow began to boom and turned into a massive centre of trade and industry
IIRC Glasgow built half of the world's metal ships at one point, and it was the world capital for Tobacco trade
I wouldn’t have expected Stirling to be on there
1801 (the census year) Edinburgh was still more populous than Glasgow by about 20,000 people (77k to 95k ish)
Thats interesting, wouldn't have expected that
I did six months at a village with a uni near Frankfurt - some of the city boy types hated it, I liked it, and it was a (sometimes delightfully) strange place
It drew a fuck-tonne of Canadians for whatever reason, the uni itself consisted of a castle ruin and despite being in the German countryside, the Wifi was pretty good
Presumably Malta is a good choice if you want an English-speaking university in a Mediterranean climate
Was it Germersheim (University of Mainz) by any chance
Nah, it was EBS
I can usually tell if someone's from the British isles or not but beyond that it can get a bit tricky
I guess Slavic people do have a distinct look to them but I won't be able to tell exactly which country they're from
Something I like to do though is go on ancestrydna and see my dna matches and guess if they're even from Scotland or not and usually I'm right, so it's not as much to do about their genetic ancestry and more to do with I guess how your looks or overall style is shaped by your culture and surroundings
I'm pretty proud that I was even able to guess from a mile away that a guy was English even though he had mostly Scottish ancestry
Exactly there’s too much variation
The most common features in Scotland are brown hair, blue eyes and pale complexion
However there’s also loads of people with ginger hair, blonde hair, dark hair, more tanned skin or brown eyes
all germans are anime characters
If you're not already vegan that's the easiest one that has a huge impact
If you live in a city there might be zero-waste shops near you that let you bring your own packaging to buy food
"we're all jock tamson's bairns"
meaning: we're all born equal
I like "da wird ja der Hund in der Pfanne verrückt" which literally translates to "that makes the dog in the pan go crazy" and is used to show surprise or disbelief
We have Bòrd na Gàidhlig which is for "securing the status of the Gaelic language as an official language of Scotland commanding equal respect to the English language
But its terribly incompetent at its job with terrible funding priorities
some of the ones in the highlands and islands are amazing but absolutely baltic
Yeah, the [Isle of Harris] ) has some beautiful beaches
depends, of late we've been getting scarily warm summers so between 15-30 degrees but the winds are quite cold
But I suppose if your from Finland that'll be not too bad lol
Kyle Falconer and the View deserve more international recognition
Kyles Music with the View or solo is incredible
Peatbog faeries
An amazing blend of electronic music mixed with traditional Scottish stuff
Really worth a listen
Really underrated imo
This is Paolo Nutini
He's the only artist that I listen to when I listen to music, which isn't that much
These are some songs from him that I love (Live versions) [Here] [Here] [Here] [Here]
[oh you know it]
>I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically -- any woman
I was a hitter
I couldn't express myself and I hit
More shoe gaze style, but I also love creature with the atom brain
Saw them at pukkelpop and they were fantastic
A love Gerry but I dunno how well known he is outwith the UK and Ireland
But like I say Kyles leagues above
Glasgow and Edinburgh
Edinburgh is the capital, home of the Scottish government
It's got the national rugby stadium, which is also the biggest stadium in Scotland
Architecturally it's far nicer, the Old and New Towns are UNESCO World Heritage sites and it's near the Forth Bridge, another UNESCO site
Glasgow is the bigger, more populated city
It's been referred to in the past with terms like "Second City of the [British] Empire", "Workshop of the Empire". It's got the national football stadium and the two most popular teams are in Glasgow
99% of the time if a noteworthy band plays in Scotland it'll be in Glasgow
They've got a few things in common: the two main airports, both are quite bit arty centres
I like how Glasgow and Edinburgh each claim it's *not* a rivalry, but can't resist piling in with the usual chippy comments the instant the other city is mentioned
> It is however mostly notable in football, nowadays there isnt thát much of a rivalry
When do you think away fans will be allowed to return to that fixture
That would be absolutely wild
And then there Dundee chilling in rampant unemployment, abuse and one of the highest teenage pregnancy rates in the country
But hey at least they have a multi billion pound museum that looks cool
Half of Glasgow either think it's the capital or will tell foreigners that it is anyway
I wouldn't worry about it, I thought Waltzing Matilda was the Australian national anthem until a couple of years ago
Glasgow is to Scotland what Toronto is to Canada
Not the capital, but still "the city" that everyone thinks of first
I was at a Fortuna Dusseldorf match this time last year and the Fortuna fans were signing "Cologne, Colgone die scheiße vom dom" and there were plenty of anti-Köln stickers in and around the stadium and around the old-town
I then went to an FC Köln game the next day and there was nothing about Dusseldorf
But then again in footballing terms FC Köln's biggest rivals are Borussia Monchengladbach
>Half of Glasgow either think it's the capital or will tell foreigners that it is anyway
Uhhhh what
I have never heard anyone in Glasgow proclaim the city to be the capital
In fact, most people here are fairly happy with Edinburgh being the capital
I'm not entirely sure that's the case
I'm pretty sure Edinburgh is better known abroad because of tourism, the castle, etc
Lol it’s definitely nowhere near that
Edinburgh and Glasgow are probably on par internationally with Edinburgh probably being most widely known if you had to pick one
Glasgow is more dominant domestically because of the larger population and because it is the media centre of Scotland
It’s a banger
I guess, I am wrong about many things lol
I just assumed Glasgow was more famous abroad because 90% of the time when people say "Scottish accent" they refer to Glasgow's accent
That's a fair point, but I wonder how many folk actually know it's a Glasgow accent
I suppose football fans are more likely to be aware of Glasgow too
The German movie *Das Boot* had an ensemble cast speaking various dialects of German, in a wide variety of accents
The movie was dubbed into English by the original cast, and it is clear that they still have varied accents
In the Pixar movie *Brave* a couple of characters were voiced by Kevin McKidd in his native Doric dialect (of the Scots language)
This is pretty much unintelligible to most English speakers
I wonder how it was handled in other language versions
Depends what you mean by dialect - accents, there's hundreds
Distinct dialects with a different vocabulary and grammar
Probably 8/9
Scots and Scottish English, Northern Ireland, Newcastle, Liverpool have their own, Yorkshire too
The Southwest probably counts as distinct, then there's a lot of people in the big cities who count - some very clearly, like the West Indian community, then Bangladeshi, Pakistani, Indian
But they all exist on a sliding scale - not everyone with the associated accent speaks in the dialect, and people might use some aspects (like -dem pluralisation in West Indian patois or the contracted definite article in Yorkshire) without any of the other signifiers
Then there's the huge amount of linguistic borrowing that goes on
One thing that is certain is that people have very strong opinions on the matter
Some will no doubt feel there are waaaay more, but these are the ones that leapt to mind
In scotland the scots “language” has different dialects depending on what part of scotland you’re in e.g. Doric in the north east, south west in the south west, etc
But there is also the debate if scots is a language or a dialect of english which means that if you class scots as a language, it has quite a few dialects and if you don’t class scots as a language then english gains a few more dialects
So yeah, we have a few dialects
Honestly it can feel like a few dialects per 1km
And within Scotland we have Gaelic (entire language, not just a dialect), Doric, Glaswegian, whatever Shetlanders speak, same for Orkney and ... Edinburgh
Not comparable to Hitler, but
The "evil" British Empire taking over the world
In Scotland we fought for centuries to remain independent but got sucked into a union using royals after England couldn't take us by force
We're still trying to get out of it after slowly getting more devolved powers in the last 50 years
We just wanted to be left alone with our warring clans and our sheep and our bagpipes
Ex colonies all have independence from the empire celebrations and we're still stuck being the bad guy because were stuck as a part of the UK
Spanish flu was named I think because Spain did the most work and research on it
Does *anyone* in Europe call them French fries
Scotland has 'Modern Studies', which is a sort of mix of politics, sociology, economics, civics etc
In Scotland we have Country Dancing
From primary 1 every child is taught the traditional dances you'd dance at a traditional Scottish Ceilidh
It usually happens around Christmas time, you paid off boy/girl and start off with the easy dances in primary school
By high school it is expected that you can dance all the dances fairly competently and the high school dances all have a Ceilidh element to them
It comes in handy at fundraisers and weddings
We have home economics compulsory up until we choose our subjects for ourselves at around 13
Mostly just basic knife skills and cooking skills (I already knew how to cook and hated it - I got marks off all the time for adding things I knew would make the bland school recipe taste better) but you could choose it as a subject after and it was more expansive with sewing and stuff and household management
I was so happy that I didn't need to do it anymore
I’m impressed by the level of detail in other countries for Home Economics
In Scotland, we learned how to make beans on toast
We have it, but as far as I can tell there really aren’t very many actual home ec teachers, so a lot of schools substitute it for something similar that another teacher is qualified to run
Yeah, our school actually uses RE to try to dissuade religious discrimination
We learned way more about Islam than any other religion, and the teachers went out of their way to point out all the various stereotypes and harmful beliefs that are either exaggerated by the media or certain political parties, or just flat out not true
On the border between Scotland and England we have a town called Gretna
Famous for young English couples crossing the border to get married without their parents permission
Since it's on the border, it means that driving after drinking a pint is legal in one side of the town but illegal on the other
I've been able to discuss the British Empire with people from various countries, including India, Burma/Myanmar, Kenya, Sri Lanka, the Caribbean Iraq, Malta, Tuvalu, Fiji
Many people have very mixed reactions to the British Empire
On the one hand, they are anti-imperialists, to the extent that they are very glad the British left, and proud of their independence
On the other hand, they also recognise that the British kept order in difficult circumstances, laid the basis for working democratic institutions, established legal and administrative structures, founded educational institutions, and built infrastructure from sewers to railways
They are still glad the British left, but also glad they were colonised by the British and not by someone else
One old guy in Burma/Myanmar told me, 'We used to say that the British Empire was bad, but I was educated at a mission school and they were good to us
The Chinese Empire will be much much worse
One dude in Iraq told me, 'The only time Iraq had justice and order was under the British mandate
A former senior judge in Malta said, 'My first passport was British
We wanted independence but had no animosity
Relations between the British and the Maltese were very good during the war
A member of Parliament in a South Pacific island said, 'When a ship came into the lagoon we would raise the British flag
If they were friendly they would come in and trade with us
If not, they stayed away
No one would threaten us, because we were under protection of the British
Worst year of my life, in fact
I understand Dutch and German to a reasonae degree
English one too
Others I haven't a goddamn clue
I can understand the German page but I think that's only because I can speak German
I hate Dutch, it looks like English drunk and i never know if it's Dutch or I've finally forgotten how to read
it if makes you feel better I also hate English
I struggle to pronoucne R and th sounds
it also NEVER spells how it sounds even though everyone says it does
Joggies and etc aye
The nice old worn clothes for the house, the ones that aren't in a great state useful for dirty jobs that might stain them
'Comf' isn't a prefix though, 'con'/'com' is
Flower of Scotland is pretty anti English
The only one I can think of is flower of Scotland which is Scotland's national anthem, but it doesn't really have any lines I'd say which are "offensive" or anything, it's just about Scotland beating England
It is a pretty good song regardless though, I like the calm tone to it
Aye we have those same songs in certain parts of Scotland, and not only would they offend some other countries but they offend a lot of people here
And on the other side of the spectrum we have songs like "billy boys" and "the sash".
As a neutral party hearing songs about the troubles makes me cringe
Aside from them I can't think of any really
Scotlands national anthem is singing about fighting the English
A few Scotland v England Rugby games the English have complained about it
Here is the start of the song:
O Flower of Scotland,
When will we see
Your like again,
That fought and died for,
Your wee bit Hill and Glen,
And stood against him (against who
Proud Edward’s Army,
And sent him homeward,
To think again
In Scotland a lot of our traditional songs are anti-English
Eg:
•Our unofficial national anthem (O Flower Of Scotland) is about fighting the English
•A lot of traditional songs are from the Jacobite Rebellion - eg "Hey Jonny Cope", "Skye Boat Song", "Charlie is my darling", etc - and therefore are anti-English
I mean flower of Scotland is literally about Scotland beating the English so it all evens out
Not really, the song doesn't mention the English in general, just "Proud Edward's army".
O Flower of Scotland,
When will we see
Your like again,
That fought and died for,
Your wee bit Hill and Glen,
And stood against him (against who
Proud Edward’s Army,
And sent him homeward,
To think again
I find it's much better to sing "*Tae* think again" even if you don't do the rest in Scots
It is a very good song
I would totally support an English national anthem, gives you something different to sing for sport at the least
God Save the Queen can stick around as the British anthem just fine though I think most of us would agree it's a bit boring
I don't think they were suggesting we all sing that
Just the English
We have perfectly serviceable national anthems of our own
> and stood against him
> *'gainst who
> Proud Edwards army
> *'bastards
> And sent them homewards
> Tae think again
It's still not talking about the English in general, even with the add-ons
Just how most Scots sing it after a few too many wee drams
I wish we could use Rule Britannia as it really does instill true pride, shame about all that empiring we did I suppose
[Uhhh]
Oh nothing at all my good friend
CKII:
Used to mostly play as Castille in Spain, partially cause most of my family is from Spain, partially because it used to be a very cushy starting place, you could rapidly expand by assassinating the Galician King and inheriting that Kingdom before pushing into Leon and hence race Navarra and Aragon to conquest the neighbouring Emirates, usually by trying to cut east towards the med as fast as possible so only you neighboured them
Though I think that start has got less simple with the updates
Also liked the various Viking starts
The Western Isles start again a favourite for being close to where I live, and being the forebearer to the Lordship of the Isles, and simply for being a romp to tear down Great Britain and Ireland
HOI4:
I've not played that much, but so far I think I've largely just down Japan, the UK, and Mexico, without too much rhyme or reason
Japan and the UK are fun obviously for the expansionist possibilities, while Mexico was just cause I wanted to get the achievement for reclaiming the old Mexican empire, which was a lot of fun
I thought it would be Székesfehérvár!
I was hoping to take a trip to Plovdiv (Bulgaria) to visit my friend there, see the sights and get better at my Bulgarian
guess I'll have to wait a wee bit longer :(
Not a city but a town
Ayr on the west coast of Scotland
I just love getting the train down for the day and walking down to the beach from the train station
Getting an ice cream on the way and then playing with my son in the park
Really miss that
Edinburgh New Town
The houses the architecture, the people
You just look at pictures of it and you know it was built for, and lived in by wealthy people
Most of the houses have basement flats that were made for staff to live in
Here in a rural scenic part on the west coast of Scotland, I have seen Portuguese, Slovakian and some weird green Norwegian plates which is as foreign as it gets for us
Seen a blacked out Mercedes-Benz on Russian diplomatic plates on the Autoroute du Soleil just outside Paris
Seen a parade of Romanian mazdas - in Stirling city centre
Generally goes:
* Northern Ireland
* Ireland
* Wales
* Anyone playing against England (Come on you Croats
We need to qualify for international tournaments first before we can do that
For football, In the likely event that Scotland doesn't qualify I usually pick another team to back
Usually France or Germany but after their last World Cup performance I am going to back Croatia next time
For Rugby I'd back Ireland in lieu of Scotland
Whoever is playing England lol
I generally go for Germany
Also whoever's playing England, and whoever's playing Ireland
Im Scottish btw
Same
Also cheer on Sweden cos my grandfather was Swedish
> I hope Scotland don’t qualify for Euro 2020
Mate don’t need to hope for something we both know won’t happen
You didn't put England out
Simple as that
We appreciate all the alliances but we have to follow the results on this one, sorry friend
Having lived in several European countries, what surprised me was the extent to which doing things across borders is, even within the EU, still surprisingly difficult
Stuff like trying to get a doctor's appointment in one EU country when your mobile phone is from another (just moved, no local sim yet; foreign number completely confused medical receptionist), or trying to get official documents from one EU country to be accepted by another (even though this should happen)
Trying to get insurance on a house you rent out in one EU country when your address is in a different EU country
All that kind of thing
Most of it was do-able, in the end, but none of it was easy or straightforward
Scotland isn't a monolith - Glaswegians tend to be a lot more chatty than folk from the east coast cities, in general
londoners be like
England is an odd place - places with 80,000 people can still have a very "rural" mindset
Especially when it can be summed up with one word most of the time: shite
They are very interesting
There's a book written by two British chaps in the 1950s who visited Andorra, San Marino, Liechtenstein and Monaco
I can't remember the name of the book or the authors, sadly,  but it really sparked my interest in micro states
San Marino is particularly interesting: the last in the line of Italian city-republics
A constitutional relic of medieval democracy
Two 'captains-regent'. Very cool
I'm not sure whether Malta counts as a micro-state - perhaps a 'mini-state'? - but it's one of my favourite countries
I've visited several times, including doing some of my PhD field research there
Iran/Syria/Iraq, none of these countries are the enemy
Iran hasn't declared war on any country since its inception, the USA has given munitions to Saddam to kill Iranians
They have shot down civilian aircraft and refused to apologise and have openly said that Iran is part of the "Axis of Evil
" No wonder Iranians feel so hostile to the USA, of course because of this they are going to work to push their interests through proxies across the middle east to prevent a brutal attack like the Iran-Iraq war from a state which would be sympathetic to the USA
If Iran killed the V.P or any other high ranking official inside the USA the USA would have declared war pretty quickly
Its a crazy thing to do and as Mossad realised they could kill these people like Soleimani or the Ayatollah but there isn't much point
All it does is aggravate tensions and hostility towards the west and create a power vaccum which would likely be filled by Islamic terror (as seen in Libya/Iraq/Afghanistan, who have suffered terribly
It's even weirder as although people say he was a crazy terrorist most of his work was against Daesh and Al-Qaeda
Although Iran is no model country by any means its nothing that the USA and CTJF-OIR wasn't doing
He was just doing it with support of Shia militias to protect against Sunni militias
As far as I have read I am yet to read of any warcrimes in Iraq or Syria that would make him worthy of a drone strike apart from the obvious power play by the USA
On the whole it seems a very silly imperialistic thing to do which will destabilise and hurt relations with the Iran even more
I am interested to see what Iran will do next
However I think talk of a third world war is inherently unlikely, although it depends on how fast Iran can enrich its uranium to create nuclear weapons which I'm sure they will increase the production dramatically
This is between the US and Iran
The whole region is a nest of vipers that the west doesn't understand and doesn't *want* to understand
Successive western interventions have only made things worse
Time to cut loose, and redirect military sending on the region into humanitarian spending to help the innocent caught up in this mess
Not as bad as Instagram comments, some of them were horrendous
>Would serbia react with an assassination
Now why did an Austrian pick Serbia of all countries for this example
About 25% of Iraq is Sunni, Sunni Muslims (Saudi/Egypt/Pakistan) are massively at odds with Shia Muslims (Iran) and will always support the Sunni Muslim side in the geopolitical argument
So yes they will be happy
However as seen with the recent elections in 2018 (where the 3 biggest parties were Shia) and the fact that 70% of Iraq is Shia they are more likely to be sympathic to Iran
So although some Iraqis will be happy most will not be
That would be incorrect too, given the Iranian seizure of a European\* tanker in the Strait of Hormuz
\**Stena Impero -* British flagged, owned by a Swedish shipping line with a multinational crew
The ship was targeted in a specifically anti-British move, but that doesn't mean that consequences won't be felt in broader European circles
As I said they are more likely to be pro Iranian
This is all a mess of Trump's making, also love that username mate
That is true, but doesn't negate the point that Iran does operate against Europe
Whether they would operate against Europe if Europe left them alone is a different question, but one that anyone forming future policy with regards to Iran should be thinking through very carefully
The English
The English again
The Irish do occasionally semi accidentally invade our territorial waters though, got a bit heated a couple months back
England
England's only past time is invading
England
As if it's the first time
Germany
Third time's the charm
Don’t even fecking think about it
We will set you on fire and boot you in the nuts
The English
England
England if we ask for another independence referendum
It's always the English
Invaded England failing to invade Germany/France
We have only one land border and the neighbours to the south have a history of crossing it
Just along the coast from here, a town still celebrates the [Battle of Largs in 1263] where we saw off an invasion attempt by some Norwegian Vikings
There's monuments, a Viking museum, a massive metal Viking on the sea front, and a yearly Viking festival with a re-enactment of the battle
Which is hilarious
Oof sorry dude
Doesn't help that I games where I can play as Scotland I always Invade England

It's probably not a military invasion - they're just buskers coming to take over the tube
Which, thinking about it, might be worse
We appreciate the specificity
England
Will you stop embarrassing us in public
Nice to see you stepping up and being honest about the past there brother, that's the first step to recovery
Uh oh
It was mate, you used the phrase correctly and in its common usage
Make that a happy face
No, but I wish we did
Those are similar dishes sure but they're not the same
Toasties are specifically made in a Breville or Breville style machine, so they're more like pockets than a sandwich and a croque ~~monster~~ monsieur isn't just cheese, it's bechamel/mornay sauce and ham
It's not really a  different *language*, but [ye cannae shove yer granny aff the bus] is a pretty catchy kids song imo

That song only sounds right coming from the back of a bus played from a phone
I haven't even read the French version and I'll hear nothing against it just because Voldemort's middle name is Elvis
In Primary we had trays to put stuff in like our snack and pencil cases and all actual school things like jotters and books and stuff were kept by the school
In secondary we had lockers but not everyone got them and if you wanted to have one you'd have to give the school a pound to get one
Alot of people didnt get one as it cost money and teachers would let you leave stuff like jackets and sports kits in their rooms while you went to other classes
In our school we had a few lockers, but they were reserved for older students (15 to 18 year olds) and you had to put a deposit down you got when you gave up the locker/left school
No lockers in primary but my high school had them for s1 to s5 and in s6 folk just cut about with their bags on their backs
only for S5/6s (last two years of school) but there's not enough for everyone so it's first come first served
We did but only for certain years
So for our secondary it was pupils in first and second year who were allowed them as they were seen as more likely to be disorganised
But they were in a terrible place in the corner of campus which was more hassle than it was worth and I just found it too much of a pain to go back and forth after lessons or before going home
So they were seldom used
My high school in Scotland only had lockers for S5-S6 (last 2 years of high school)
Yes, the Edinburgh vaults are thought to be one of the most haunted locations in the world (if you believe in such things)
They were built
under Edinburghs South Bridge originally as storerooms for businesses in the 17th century, but were quickly filled with the poor and disreputable people
It witnessed murders, kidnappings and all the other grizzly stuff
Very spooky

I think the main difference is that in the UK as well as other countries the bus exit is normally next to the drivers console in the front meaning you naturally walk past them when you get off the bus
Whereas in Europe its more likely to be in the middle which makes it much hard to say thanks
Yea it is
Everyone that leaves the bus passes the driver and thanks them
Ive noticed the same when leaving a plane, we all thank the staff
Yep, always thank the driver and if you don't you're a wanker

It's nae England, that's all
I love that the Scotland-England border follows the sereval hundred million year old split from when Great Britain was 2 islands
We've got a funky pointy hat (if you were to ignore our rather large number of islands)
&#x200B;
Others I enjoy include Iceland looking like an odd fish, India with its bottom spike and Russia because **chonk**
I always look at norway and finland or sweden and finland as a big ol penis
Or all together for a penis split at the tip
On the west coast of Scotland there is a penis and ball at Campbeltown
Hey what the actual fuck, you told us Scotland  was special and now this
Both you and Finland used to come visit us, now you're eyeing up Poland
Now I just feel used
You said that's what you liked about us
you know what just you go we'll be fine, we can find someone else to rape us easily you know
I knew it, you were thinking about England the entire time
You're just like the French
Well I have news for you we were thinking about Ireland
Oh nothing wrong with the French apart from like you they can't get over the English
We get it they had a thing for 100 years moe on
Well that's true we did entertain you
The Danish were right about you
Fine then, it's not like I enjoyed it anyway
and yes Finland was better
I'm not at all surprised but it's just abhorrent
I think the UK should try and kick Turkey out of NATO but I don't know if that's possible, it certainly isn't likely though
Trumps decision on this was a disgusting betrayal of an already oppressed people who need all the help they can get and they bloody deserve it for what they have sacrificed
Not that they should be abandoned regardless
Such a shit situation
Kurds deserve their own country

Sturgeon must condemn
Fuck Erdogan man, what an absolute piece of shit
So will we give yous back to the Russians then
Given that Estonians having their own country took pieces out of them
Or would you prefer the Swedes
Yup
Some people can become indistinguishable for the most part, maybe with the occasionally lilt
My mother's Spanish, most people locally seem to forget that she is and tourists often think she's a native of this Scottish village because her accent doesn't usually reveal it
And I've met young non-native speakers from Spain, Greece, Germany, Pakistan who had accents that were either subtle and didn't draw much attention (in a similar way to say, Highland accents, there is some tinge but often not enough for people not familiar with it to place) or they can have a surprisingly faithful regional accent (met a few with quite convincing Northern or Glasweigin accents because those are the people they met and spoke with most often)
It's a lot more difficult to place a lot of non-natives that I think people give credit, especially given the large number of English accents they can fall  into for defence
Honestly, the easiest ones to spot are usually those determined to shoot for RP instead of a more natural accent
People also probably just don't notice the ones who pass because, you know, they pass and aren't obvious
To a non-native speaker I can totally understand where they're coming from so I'm pleasantly surprised when a non-native speaker can pick me out as Scottish
Norwegians and Icelanders seem to be particularly good at it
French Canadians on the other hand seem to struggle to place my accent though
The thing is, English is so broken that these spellings are still surprisingly legible to native speakers like myself
That's fair enough, especially if you aren't constantly surrounded by English speech like those living in English speaking countries
That said, the whole accent thing is obviously not super important in English anyway since there isn't a singular 'correct' accent, so even if you speak quickly and have a little Italian lilt or cadence, doesn't matter so long as the other party understands
I sometimes feel like we don't make that clear enough, sadly, and some people pursue a 'perfect' accent that doesn't exist (usually RP, which
isn't an accent well liked by a lot of Scots and Northerners) when honestly you just need to be understandable
Hell, quite often a little bit of a different accent helps and sounds a lot more genuine and sincere than RP
But now I'm rambling, lol
What if my Irish friend and I were both speaking standard English
I imagine that would be an absolute shitemare to tell apart then
Ha, I've always found our accents to sound more "jaggy" than "curly" but there you go
I can pick out some Canadian accents from Americans but not all (Newfoundland is cheating obviously
do you know what juropijan means
I thought that was the subreddit at play in the title but I really can't figure out what juropijan can be
edit: just realised it might be european, where the hell are people saying european like juropijan
Ah, I was meaning using standard English words and actually enunciating my Ts
My attempts at English and American accents are very poor to say the least
I've actually heard most of these
I find it quite funny how Dutch people tend to translate their Euphemisms and phrases into English
I know, It's great
I sometimes hear people speaking Dutch and shoving English words in or vice versa
I've heard there are some problems in Dutch schools with classes taught in poor English though
I honestly think you're doing a disservice to your kids by trying to keep an "adults only language" lol
If my parents were bilingual or trilingual and hid a language from me instead of teaching me when my brain was still a sponge I'd be quite annoyed with them
There are lots of people from rural America who are barely literate so it wouldn't surprise me that the average Dutch person has better English skills than the average yank
Universal English is quite an interesting concept but I have to admit that it hurts a little to hear continental Europeans trying to speak English with an American accent
That makes sense actually, might be a good way of doing it if/when I decide to learn a foreign language myself
(if I ever decide I want kids
I actually started Polish on Duolingo a little while ago so I'm planning on starting that up again, was using music to help there as I had a hard time finding Polish TV shows and movies with good actors and directors
I've actually heard of dark, and I've heard lots of good things about it
If I wasn't planning on moving to Poland at some point I would probably be learning Dutch
As with every other country, we share a lot in common with our neighbours
Our national celebration being about a poet rather than a revolution or battle is pretty unique though

A brilliant idea and I'm super happy we adopted it, great job Finland
I'd have said the GAA is Ireland's most unique feature

Interested to see \^.^
Aye, usually depends on if you're in Govanhill or Milngavie though
At the moment Gerry Cinnamon is pretty popular so something like Belter or Canter, maybe
If we’re talking Scottish Gaelic Runrig pretty much have everyone beat
Proclaimers 500 miles, every Scottish cunt hates it but for some reason we are still forced to listen to it
Aye they did but there’s really nobody who can replace them
That being said Skipinnish are apparently well popular with the teuchters, though don’t know if they sing in Gaelic cos am no a teuchter
Glasgow - other Scottish people struggle to understand them because of their thick accent
They also talk really quick and aggressively
Aberdeen because they shag sheep
Orkney and Shetland
They feel much closer to Norway than Scotland
probably shetland and the other islands, they seem to be forgotten about sometimes
Scotland is probably divided into 3-5 very distinct regions with two good candidates for the odd one out
Either the north east around Aberdeen where Scots is spoken to a significant degree and they have a whole bunch of oil money or the Western Islands which are very christian, still engage in a bit of subsistence agriculture and Gaelic is spoken to a significant degree
Shetland; they live in a box
Let me guess are you fae Glasgow or Edinburgh
I think part of what makes it weird is that the population of London is a couple million more than Scotland, so it really does just become it's own dominant entity in the UK
Glaswegians don't really talk Scots
It's very different to English dialects, but it's also very different to other dialects in Scotland
I'm from the north east, and I can often understand Ayrshire and D+G folk better than weegies, despite having to go past Glasgow to get to Ayrshire and the South West from Aberdeen
Just come back from York and they lot were much easier to understand than Glaswegians
They have this tendency to exaggerate their accents around non-Scottish people too, desperate to be misunderstood so they can complain about it
I live only half an hour from Glasgow and no one outside of their city speaks remotely like them, it's so strange
Edinburgh, where bout are you lad
We would, bit the Tory twats down south want their oil
Yeah, the thick accents of Glasgow and to a lesser extent Dundee are something of an anomaly
Also really annoying to have people come to the Highlands and moan we don't sound 'Scottish'. Aye, we don't sound lime your stereotypical Weegie up here, funny that
Glasgow is also a wee bit funny (sad funny) with the whole sectarianism in football
It's a weird city
Aberdeeenshire
A real teuchter
Tbf I go to uni in Edinburgh and you could easily have been describing my experience
yikes
If a majority of people in Orkney and Shetland want it, then yes
What's more important, democracy or profit
Having stayed in Edinburgh for uni, I also find it weird the (primarily Glasweigin) claims that Edinburgh doesn't have a Scottish accemt but a posh, essentially English accent
Which seems to be entirely based on setting Glasgow as the norm
It's weird and stupid
This is based on them thinking everyone in Edinburgh is posh
Working class Edinburgh accents don’t sound English at all
Alright then, they don't leave
Democracy
Theres pretty much no awful mainstream music coming out of Scotland just now
Im sure if you look at the unknown theres some pish but the big acts are all at the very least tolerable
Looking more widely at Britain however; Ed Sheeran and Sam Smith are shite of the highest order
I hate the word Chav so much man
Be the Holy Roman Emperor one, so I think likely, the HRE did like reasserting control of Italy
Gotta love a bit of Flower of Scotland
Flower of Scotland is just about beating the English
I like it
Bagpipes are never getting old
I like ours but I'm not sure if it's an official "national anthem" or just something we sing at rugby
[O' Flower of Scotland] is decent if a little slow paced
Scotland the Brave is way better though
[Here] is the lyrical version and [here] is the bagpipe version
Funeral dirge is about right
I've never liked GSTQ and not just because of the fact it sounds boring
It'd be nice to have an anthem that talks up the country or the people (like a lot of others do) rather than showing deference to an individual
I do like Flower of Scotland but surprisingly I've seen folk calling that a dirge as well
It's quite something hearing it at Murrayfield, especially when the music cuts out for the second verse
Love hearing it during the 6 Nations Rugby
Northern Ireland should have "We're not brazil we're nothern Ireland" haha
Or just select  a random Queen song every year and cycle through then as anthems
Just to cause maximum confusion
Tbh, I kinda like that Spain has no lyrics for the anthem
Seems more inclusive than lyrics, which sort of funnel you towards some idea, while a lyricless anthem opens it up
It at least stops the squabbles that surround every other anthem
We have it in Austria and the UK too
Another one that is really widespread in CH and A is Schwedentropfen or Schwedenbitter (herbal remedy)
I think it's popular in southern Germany as well
Is this actually a thing or is it like one of those Gaelic words or phrases made up to annoy learners
Neither does Gaelic but they're still known to be a big mischievous
Mixing the very formal and the informal
"Sir please may I have a carton of fags and these bevvies
" sort of thing
&#x200B;
Quite a lot of people get the word order mixed up in a whole number of ways too
Often when dealing with Indian colleagues at work they will ask me to "kindly do the needful" which is something we would never say here in the UK
I remember in German class when my German teacher told us the German for mobile phone was a "handy" me and my friend and then others burst out laughing and then others when they realised what we were laughing at
It was typical teenage immaturity but here in Scotland a handy is a slang term for a hand job so I would be very apprehensive about mixing up the terms
Whom has a purpose when using more formal English especially when writing a letter but yeah if you use it down the local pub you look like a bampot
Incredibly formal and I can honestly say the only time I ever use it is in formal letter writing: "To whom it may concern".
Even then it seems overly formal and awkward but I prefer it to some alternatives
I'm pretty guilty of this tbh from living in the US for a bit and spending a little too much time on the internet I've screwed up my speech a bit
Imagine a slightly Irishy Scottish accent saying Americanisms
It's a way of asking you to action something, it comes across a bit condescending and passive aggressive alot of the time
I understand its not meant like that and used to it now
So doesn't get my back up anymore
It is not uncivilised
Some commentators are comparing it to Ukraine, but that's very inaccurate
We have rules and standards and will uphold and enforce them
Brawling is unheard of
But what we do have is a very robust, cut-n-thrust, adversarial style of debating
The booing, shouting, heckling etc rarely gets out of hand
What you are watching is not chaos, it is a highly scripted, traditional, formulaic type of adversarial exchange
If you want an analogy, it is closer to fencing than to a street brawl
They are fighting, and it can be vicious, but it is an organised type of fighting
It's embarrassing as fuck
Have sex, make love
Polish isn't a romance language, but it's very romantic
You cultivate it, like roses in a garden
Lovely
I would say that "fare" is better translated as "do"
do sex
do love
So what you are really saying is that you like to plow (plough) your furrows
Got it
In Scotland we have the 'tartan noir' for the crime/dark stuff
Same root as most of the other folks using black for that
In journalism, the 'red tops' are the gossipy/trashy papers, because of the colour of their mastheads
'blue' means a bit ruder
No idea where that comes from
We had something similar to your "Bird" languag where I grew up in Scotland
It was called "gibberish", or in the actual language of gibberish it was called "Juruguberegeririgish" (the only "irregular" word in the language, interestingly)
Unlike egg language and pig latin it had *a lot* more syllables, and like all these kid languages kids could pick it up in a matter of minutes from one another, but adults never seemed to manage to, even when it was explained to them
It's a bit like this:
"Rule 7
No low effort questions
At all
"R*^(urrug)*ule S*^(erreg)*ev*^(erreg)*en
N^(orrog)o l^(orrog)o e^(rrege)ff^(orrog)ort q^(uerreg)esti^(orrogo)ns
^(Arrag)at ^(Orrog)oll"
After a while we could speaking it shockingly fast and it came in so useful avoiding others hearing our conversations unless they were peers and or paying attention
That would have been shocking to behold
Our teachers never mastered ours, even though they tried to ban it and then get us to teach them how it worked hah
Where else would you store a sewing kit
Would be nice if Scotland never tried colonialism as it drew us into the UK when the colony failed
I don't know much at all about history in general so I'm fairly limited, but I'd say the independence vote in 2014
One of the arguments against independence was the fact that we'd be pulled out of the EU but that's happening anyway, so why not
Probably find a way to avoid the Highland Clearances
There would be a much bigger Gaelic population and native speakers aswell as maybe having a bigger population as a whole
Would've been nice if the Darien scheme wasn't a total failure
All of our wars with England, yes I like the rivalry but King Edward (I, II), just leave us alone
I notice you switch between England, GB and the UK in your comment
But this is hundreds of years before either of the latter two existed as political concepts
Would the UK even exist
Would the UK exist as an entity if this had happened
I think we do, I was concious I got into more pavement and corridor bother after coming back from the states than before I went
It's not like a concrete rule or anything though there are all sorts of reasons why you would walk on the other side
We do, in schools anyway
I naturally walk on the right having been taught to do so on roads (so you can see oncoming traffic and jump out the way if need be) and growing up in a rural enough area that I've spent a significant amount of time walking on country roads
It always irks me when people implement walk on the left rules for this reason (escalators are a different thing, I get why it's stand on the right for them)
Surprised me, never was a thing in my school but a lot of others agree with you
Apparently mine opted for sheer open anarchy instead
Malta, Ireland and the various Crown Dependencies also go the same side
Not sure if Iceland does, beong the other independent European island nation
Most annoying is one person walking dead center of a thin part of pavement, arms thrust out to the side as if they hope the next gust of wind will make them airborne
I just want to get past you you git, stop jumping back to the middle of the pavement, you ambling overgrown penguin and let me overtake
to be fair the schooling system is different in scotland than it is in england
Aye, but I saw a Scot say it as well
That said, my school was rural, so might explain
Little need when their schools are likely same population as the biggest vilage here
Border reivers
A collection of rebellious families in the border regions that resented both English and Scots authority, and lived by cattle theft, playing one side off against the other and the odd bit of mercenary fighting
Queen Elizabeth 1 said "with ten thousand such men, James VI could shake any throne in Europe

Assuming, of course, he could bend them to his will and get them all to fight on the same side

Yeah it's a shame you would have had more luck herding cats
The only mandatory pricing law that comes to mind is minimum unit pricing for alcohol
Any alcohol sold must cost at least £0
50 per unit, so a standard 70cl bottle of vodka must be at least £13
13 and 1l is I think £18
It was more aimed at high-strength cider which teenagers used to drink at the park because it was so cheap
For a few years now we have had minimum unit pricing on alcohol in Scotland, which means if you're buying alcohol it has to cost at least 50p per unit
White lightning was the way to go tbf
We don't get taught about it too much despite it having been pivotal to WWII and the Cold War, which are covered in school history
For those who know about it, most view it as the unescapable consequence of the geopolitical game that every major power had been playing at the time and would continue to play after the war - as usual, much to the detriment of ordinary people
I know Churchill "betrayed" Poland during the conference but I genuinely believe after the Warsaw uprising failed there was nothing he could do
Curious as to your thoughts on how Poland could have come out of the conference independent or not as a soviet puppet
Doing so would likely have met compromises elsewhere as possibly Greece or Italy may have gone to the Eastern bloc to accommodate for this loss of territory
The Yalta conference is also not taught here at all in the curriculum
I don't think the average person would know much about it apart from it was a peace conference where post WW2 boundaries were drawn up in the Crimea
I think the fall of Czechoslovakia at the time was more to do with the failure of Edvard Beneš to counter act the soft coup of Klement Gottwald
I don't think our coverage of WW2 went into this level of detail
The only reason I've even heard of the Yalta conference (and the others) is because it's a subject of interest to me and I've read countless books on the subject
Your average punter in the street won't know what the hell the Yalta Conference is, never mind have an opinion on it
Pace of life that you see in places like Spain and Italy
If we could also copy their cuisine (and not deep fry it) too
I'd like to copy the "separated from Britain" aspect of Ireland
You can't beat a pizza crunch though
Have you tried doing a Norwegian accent
You've just summed it up well
Whisky, without the 'e'.
Some of our whiskies are very smoky - there are whiskies produced on the Scottish islands which still use peat within the malting process, giving this flavour
The smoky whiskies are much more of an acquired taste I would say, the non-smoky ones are easier to drink
Whisky, or as Americans call it "Scotch". It depends on what casks they're matured in, but they usually taste like heaven
Whisky hands down
How does it taste
I don’t know how to describe
But I love it
For Scotland, obviously Whisky is top
Got a good distillery in my town, and I do like it sometimes, but not a huge drinker
After that, there has been a huge boom in both Beer breweries and Gin distilleries
Personally I like Gin but do think it is a bit of a scam, basically put in industrial alcohol and a few berries, with some fancy branding and then sell it for £40 a bottle
The Gin industry has gone so crazy, I can imagine the Gin bubble May burst at some point
Rum is now also on the up
People love alcohol :)
I find people see smokier whiskies as more prestigious but the smoother whiskies are much easier to drink and much more flavourful I find
Bunnahbhan 12 and Deanston Virgin Oak are the nicer ones in my opinion, smooth with vanilla hints
I fucking *love* Beirão. It's even fun to say
In simple terms, 'whisky' is the Scottish spelling whereas 'whiskey' is the Irish spelling
Also worth noting that they aren't the same obviously - just like not all Scottish whiskies are the same
>When you say they "still" use peat, it sounds like it's out of necessity
Because it is out of necessity; the use of peat is absolutely necessary because that's the way they have always produced it, in order to give it the same flavour that it has always had traditionally
Not a chance, the -ão is impossible
But I will always try hahaha
No, I agree with you
But when I said that they *still* use peat I wasn't referring to a lack of alternative methods, but that they continued to use peat in the process in order to follow tradition and maintain its flavour
Whereas many Lowland and Speyside whiskies converted from peat to coke
Ah yes, the false friends, have a mate working in a German speaking country and she keeps meeting Germans using works like that thinking they are English
There's one for projector which I have completely forgotten already because it was so unintuitive
'Beamer' or something
I remember it made me think of car headlamps, anyway
It also works both ways, 'trinkt' keeps tripping me up, it's 'to drink' or something, but naturally I keep instinctively thinking 'drinked'.
Don't mind the accent, mate
It's not like we have a proper one, a few dozen on this island alone before you even talk about Ireland, North America, Australasia, Malta
not like most English speakers give a damn about accents anyway, so long as you can be understood
Not a European language, but one of the hardest parts of reading Korean is Konglish - English words written in Korea , which are 'forced' to use Korean phonetics, and I then have to work out what English word they correspond to, e.g. 트럭 'teu-rok' is truck, 화이팅 'hwa-ee-ting' is fighting (used as an encouragement)
When people say this it's like "calling captain obvious

Not my language as I'm not a native Gaelic speaker but one that stands out is Fort William - *An Gearasdan* ("The Garrison")

It also seems to particularly bother the anti-Gaelic roadsign mob so that's a plus

I know a guy who's little sister is Chinese, grew up in Scotland any time someone asked her were she was from she would say Scotland
If they said yeah but were are you really from she would say "paisely is still part of Scotland fucking bawbag" if it was was someone from the east coast of Scotland talking to her they would say she was from Glasgow then and the response can only be described as *angry paisely noises*
When someone needs to refer England and Wales together (it happens quite a lot in legislation), the term is England and Wales
Britain is often used as shorthand for Great Britain
The qualifier "great" is there to differentiate from Bretagne in France

The corruption is just astonishing, like Zimbabwe in the '80s
No thanks : ) i like free healthcare and paid holidays way too much
A lot of people have mentioned other reasons that I agree with so I’ll give my specific reason
I’m a teacher, the salary i’d get in the states might be slightly better but on average it’s the basically the same
But my contract would be far more insecure
Teachers are often on yearly review, and can be let go on a whim
By comparison, I got a permanent contract after 1 year and that’s not unusual - the unions here would go apeshit if they thought schools were using 1 year contracts as probation
I’d also have much larger classes to deal with; legally mine are capped at 20, American teachers have to contend with twice that number (if not more)
Combined with longer hours (seriously, starting at 7am
), and the sheer amount of marking and assessment they need to do
Then there’s the usual cost of living; i make a good wage here
You see a lot of teachers (not just in expensive areas) complaining that they are making peanuts or have to work over the summer to pay bills
More work, less job security, less financial security
No thanks
For the sake of national healthcare, decent short and long distance public transport,  a well respected leader and a school system without a fear of assault rifles, I'll stick to visiting
*Stovies* - left over stew thickened with mashed potato until it's consistent
*Mince and tatties* - ground beef or lamb cooked in gravy, served with mashed potato
Munchie box please
> Is it the same curry as the curry sauce in the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany
Here its like a much more seasoned ketchup
Nah, it's the kind of curry sauce base you'd have in a chicken curry
[Here's] an article from the Irish Times explaining the ingredients
I'm just about to finish a night shift and now all I want is a munchie box
Yea, It's kind of disrespectful to other people's languages
Trying to say that English is somehow above theirs
Where does "Öster" come from
I know reich means realm/empire
That's not what I meant either
I was just stating that it might seem to people that English gets prioritised over their language or over others
I know how the UN works
Oh you're alpha mate
You seem more offended by my comment mate
You *pussy*
Are you alright
having a bad day
I don't think there's a trend of puns or anything like that when it comes to shop names but there was some takeaway place that opened up behind an Aldis shop, and some ultra creative person managed to come up with the amazing name "bacchialdis" like it's some italian name, but it's really just called "back of aldis"
Well I can think of a poet from Scotland but not a poem, the poet is Robert Burns
Not very
Most people have *heard of it,* few people could actually tell you what it is and very few will have read it
At least in Scotland
I see foxes all the time and also have seen deer running behind my house
Seen a stoat once when I was having dinner in a restaurant with my wife and had no idea what it was so had to google it
Foxes are the only ones I see regularly, but they're practically urban animals these days
Deer sometimes wander in to the outer suburbs of cities
Can confirm
I grew up in the countryside of the south west (right next to Exmoor in Devon)
Would always have cows, sheep, horse etc, that have got out of their fields and just gone for a little stroll
One time there was a cow swimming in the harbour, just chilling and cooling off  It was a tough place to live due to low average wage and high living costs, but I miss it there a lot
Great sceanic place
Not great due to the human rights abuse in the country there's only one good thing about it and that a woman actually designed one of the stadiums that is being built for it but even that feels hollow because of their human rights record
I don't really care
Scotland don't tend to qualify anyway and I prefer club football
Would prefer it to be in the summer though
Because people have no taste clearly
How anyone could possibly dislike Haggis is beyond me
I think we're at a cultural point in the west where we're emphasising exoticism in our cuisine (again), it'll shift back again soon
I don't really think there's anything particularly more or less complex about traditional British cooking than traditional Italian cooking, it just doesn't fit into the cultural norm so well
Just looking for different things in their meals
North has heartier, filling winter meals, they have different kinds of meals and favour them
Wouldn't really say they are better
Spending time with family in Spain and the recurring meal every day is salad which
doesn't exactly tickle me compared to my normal lunch
That said, overfishing definitely was an issue in parts of the UK
Iirc, my villages economy and quite a few others got badly hurt by overfishing export fish like herring
Not discounting your criticism of the other comment, especially since overfishing tended to be basically our version of a cash crop for export, limiting its use locally
'An Ìmpireachd Naomh na Ròimhe' in Gàidhlig
Directly translated it means 'The Holy Empire of the Romans' or 'The Holy Empire of Rome'. 'Ròimhe' can mean Rome or The Romans
"ken" in parts of Scotland can mean "know" for instance "do you ken where the post office is" so mixing it up could causes some confused faces thinking you're a local gone a bit mad :)
I would say Billy Connolly
A historical figure would be Robert the Bruce
All hail our orange queen
Not  any of those but we do have Communists
Off the back of this:
> 19 years old married and having kids
High school sweethearts is another peculiarly American thing
I know 1 person under 60 that married their high school boyfriend/girlfriend
It just does not happen here
But you constantly see Americans talk about their husbands/wives and how they’ve been dating since HS
Wonder if it’s because of the whole “no sex before marriage” puritanical attitude
You get married super young because you want to get it on and that’s the only way you’re ‘allowed’.
I'd like to think most Americans also find r/relationships culturally alienating
Mainly because it's full of complete zoomers
Yeah; it pops up in the relationship subs pretty frequently, it’s a common trope in American TV, etc
You don’t see the same trope in the UK - even when people did marry someone they knew in high school (which is really rare) it’s never referred to in those terms
Jesus
This person sounds like she’s never stepped foot outside of the US before
Does she not know that the UK (especially London and the southern areas of the country) is incredibly diverse
My personality changes when I speak other languages I become more violent sounding
I find that I do that when I drop my accent and try speak RP
Could be the same reason
I feel like opening your mouth wide is specifically an american thing because of their specific accents
In Scotland it’s mainly plumbing
It does take a lot of skill and strength but apparently it’s one of the easiest jobs to get into
Eh I know people shit on trains in the UK but my experience has been pretty overwhelming positive and I quite frequently use the so called "worst" train line in Scotland and never had any problems
Edinburgh: beauty and castle
Glasgow: drugs
Aberdeen: oil
Dundee: Weird boat art gallery thing
Edinburgh: Scotland’s capital, architecture, history, posh people, students, fringe festival, Hogmanay, Scottish Parliament
Glasgow: rough, working class, post industrial, modern and dynamic, strong accent, big population
Aberdeen: buildings all made of granite, oil wealth, ferry links to Shetland and Orkney
Dundee: up and coming with the new V&A museum, computer game design, universities, post industrial
Inverness: gateway to the highlands of Scotland, backpackers and tourists
Ah c’mon, Glasgow’s got more going for it than drugs these days
How do Finnish people feel about Swedish speaking fins
I’m guessing The Netherlands
Pretty much everywhere in Scotland is SNP, not just Glasgow
Glasgow is actually known as the drugs Capital of Europe
It's the 4th largest city in Scotland, pop about 150k (tiny in US terms I know)
You're not missing much tbh
Dundee is famous for Jute Jam and journalism since back in the Victorian days it was the Jute Production capital of the probably the whole world
It also had a huge jam sector or as Americans call it Jelly, Dundee is where Orange jam or marmalade was invent as well
And how could we forget journalism, Dundee at the time was a huge Whaling city so ships were built to withstand the ice of the artic
When the UK decided to explore Antarctica Dundee was the place that built the Ship ‘RRS discovery’  (royal research ship)
In fact NASA names the Discovery space shuttle after the ship
Dundee is also the Birthplace of the company Rockstar and is where Grand Theft Auto was invented, Dundee also is home to the company 4J Studios that is responsible for all the Minecraft console updates
Lemmings was also created in Dundee and has a statue dedicated to it
Nah, no implication
It’s just a strong accent
Now now, no need for that
Edinburgh and Glasgow always get compared but it’s silly because they’re very different cities with different attributes
Oh that’s interesting
I presumed there might be some animosity but didn’t realise there were political differences
Why do they tend to be wealthier
Look at the way the different counties vote, almost all are SNP
It’s still the majority even if not over 50% of the population votes one way, it’s still a majority since no other party got even close to what the SNP did
Read it
It just says cocaine capital
Europe
Haha yes they do speak very quickly as well
There was a reality series here called The Scheme years ago about really rough people on an estate outside of Glasgow
When they showed it in England they had to subtitle it
Haha
Oooooh
Ok, that’s helpful thanks
A bit like Anglo Irish people
More people in Scotland still voted for SNP than any other party, and the SNP hold 80 odd percent of the seats, which is no small amount
Probably political stagnation, some central-western EU countries will try and for a united country but the South and East will likely tell them to calm down
Scotland will join
Hello I would like to join please
Yeah leave a light on for us
We will be coming home soon
I can't really see unifying into one state really working tbh
I mean, even the smaller member states have several regions trying to break away from them due to cultural, political and social reasons, I find it very optimistic to believe that a truly unified EU would survive the test of time and not rip itself apart with such wildly different cultures, politics and not even a unifying language or religion
There isn't really anything there to make you feel like you are connected to a citizen from elsewhere, that you share the same country
And I say that as someone who likes the EU, wants it to succeed, but unifying, trying to become some large nation like Russia, China or the US will kill it
Hell, large continental nations aren't exactly brilliant entities to begin with
A more loose collection as is the case now seems the best way for the EU to survive
I'm not even totally convinced of that, sadly
It would require every part to possess and keep trust, which can evaporate, especially when it inevitable some parts are going to do something the rest disapproves of
Especially when the union is already prone to accusations of being dominated by Germany and to a lesser degree France, whatever federal system exists above the different nations is likely to cause divisions
I really don't see it unless people start identifying as European first instead of their own nations nationality
As it stands, it does not look like the necessary connections are there to allow it to survive, especially as integrating as far as we have already spawned a wave of far-right politics to hit EU member states
>Yet all of them want to stay in the EU
For now
If the new master becomes like the old, it isn't difficult to imagine how they will react
A supranational organisation and another large state/empire spanning to continent are very different beasts, and unification may cause more cracks than it solves
Easier living in a central power house than a peripheral nation to believe everyone will be happy
The centre always believes the periphery will follow
I'm all for linguistic diversity, at no point did I say it should go away
I was pointing out that it does run counter to unifying peoples, as shared language is a major boost for creating a sense of shared nationhood
On the flipside, differing languages, even when they aren't really used, are so often symbols of difference and a banner under which nationalisms rally: the Irish used and use the Irish language to differentiate themselves from their former colonising neighbours, the Scottish Gaelic is increasingly associated with Scottish nationalism
Basques, Catalans, etc, language is part of what defines peoples and their borders and often aids in nationalist urges to seperate from other cultures
Lack of shared language is among other things what will impede people from feeling united, and won't help create a shared European citizenship when certain languages will naturally beat out others at the top most levels
>On this topic, can you lot start speaking Gaelic more often
It's such a beautiful language
It's a language that is basically only spoken in the Highlands and Islands, and which was devestasted by the Clearances, suppression following the Jacobite Rebellions, and general indifference from other parts of Scotland
There isn't really any way to use it day to day unless you live in a particularly Gaelic part of the islands and being absolutely honest, it'll probably never be used like Catalan or other regional languages are, given it isn't even *the* language of Scotland, but of the rural, sparsely populated periphery
I've lost my Gaelic due to lack of any sphere to speak it in
There are attempts to help it, but no one wants to fund rural teuchters language, so no, we can't speak more of it, because it isn't as easy as that
More or less my point
There is a reason language tends to be a unifying aspect of a state: if you can't communicatw with your fellow citizens, you don't feel connected
It's one of the things that bind people together
I think most people just don't think about it
Most of the time it's brought up is as a joke ie person says they're going to go to India and then someone makes a joke about not staying for 150 years this time
&#x200B;
When it's talked about seriously the emotions of older people range from cautiously positive to very negative (with some outliers) and the emotions of younger people range from neutral to negative with more around the sort of neutral point (again with some outliers)
Recently Personally I’ve see more and more young people being pro empire something I thought was long gone from the average brits life
But even just out in the street I’ve noticed a lot more young people that are proud to be ‘British’ and are proud about the empire
I still think they are a minority but I just find it odd that it’s still something people care about
Also when I mean young people I’m talking older teens not 20s as I’m more than certain that many people who are in there 20s are the most anti empire generation to date
I'd say the split is actually pretty consistent, over all ages
lots of people will disagree with me but being 22, the social media generation, it is quite common to presume everyone your age has the same opinion as you
That is just how social media seems to function, but there are plenty of youths who feel the world is better because of imperialism, and maybe even some more who yearn for a return to imperialism
I think it depends on your politics, I would say if your left you recognize empire was a terrible time for the people that were colonized, where as some on the right would like to see those days back again
Im 16
I despise having to acknowledge the atrocities we committed in the name of the empire
Like it's utterly disgusting
Scottish first names like Angus, Hamish and Morag would be a give away, alongside Gaelic names like Eilidh and Seoridh
Scottish surnames, of course, typically start with Mc or Mac like the infamous McDonalds
Not specifically, as there's been a lot of internal migration, but thanks to Scottish clans, some surnames are still distinctly associated with certain parts of the country
- MacLeod - the Hebrides, especially Skye
- McNeill - the Hebrides, especially Lewis and Harris
- Gordon - the North East, especially Huntley
- MacRae - the Kintail area (the Kinlochshiel shinty team is always about 70% MacRae)
Names ending "-bister" are local to Orkney and Shetland
There's countless others, but it's worth noting that Scotland is a heavily urbanised country now, and you'll find folk in the cities with these names that have no known connection to that area
In terms of first names, Gaelic names - especially with Gaelic spelling - Ruaridh, Eilidh, Sine, were traditionally associated with the north west Highlands and Islands, but now there's something of a fashion for middle-class parents to give their children a traditional name
Nordic names - Rognvald, Thorfinn etc
are still almost exclusive to Orkney and Shetland, and even there, standard Scots names are more common
Most of our surnames are pretty obvious, since where the Scottish clans were based is mostly public knowledge
Off the top of my head - people with the surnames Sutherland, Mackay, Sinclair and Gunn are mostly from Caithness (very top of Scotland)
MacDonald, McLeod, Campbell, MacKenzie are usually west coast/Hebrides
Grieve, Flett, Moar, Balfour, Linklater, Tait, Rendall, Drever, Leask, Isbister, Clouston, Harcus - all Orcadian names (Orkney Islands)
Fraser, Gordon and Douglas are from the borders
Taylor and Stewart/Stuart is everywhere
There's your typical Gaelic first names as well, pretty common here
Names like Nairn and Isla too
If your first name is Senga, you are likely a middle aged Weegie (Glasgow) woman
Probably a bit of a chav
Not so much nowadays, but having a surname for a first name used to be a sure-fire signifier that you were from a Presbyterian background
Similarly, in Glasgow anyway, Irish-sounding or Saints’ names implied you were a Catholic
Examples:
Chalmers Paton = Past Grand Master of the Orange Order
Francis McAvennie = Former City Councillor and Celtic Fan
Oh gosh, what have I done
...probably shouldn’t mention my surname is actually English
Yes, there’s certainly some truth in that
I imagine less true of Gaelic names though
I think if you were to combine a common Scottish first and second name, you’d certainly infer at least Scottish ancestry though
That’s very interesting
I didn’t know that
Wonder if it’s somewhat more prevalent in the west as I’m in Edinburgh and don’t feel as though I can think of many examples amongst friends and colleagues
I’d say it’s much more prevalent in Glasgow, and I don’t think parents think much about preserving traditional family names any longer
But my father has one of these “Protestant names” despite his family later converting to Catholicism (leading to some surprise and suspicion) and my uncle had to pretend his name wasn’t Patrick when he started working in the 1960s.
The sectarianism in Glasgow was so strong when I was young that I’ve heard family members assert that they can spot a Catholic or Protestant from the shape of their face
Trevor Francis is an Englishman
He’s beyond the trivially small world of West of Scotland Sectarianism
(And I got it wrong
McAvennie was a footballer, McAveety was the politician
I’m distantly related to both, that’s my excuse
David McCracken, who played for Dundee United, was nicknamed ‘Phil’.
Born and raised in Melbourne, Australia
Moved to Dublin for 7 years, been in Edinburgh for the last 9 years
No plans to go back home except for an occasional holiday, it's far too isolated for me although I do miss the food
Its not a sentence but I know 1 word of Russian and its that apple is yablika (dunno how to spell it)
I can't really spell it, but phonetically -
"ya ne gevorio pa russki"
Not a sentence but the word kinderwerfer is my favourite thing ever
An amazing phrase in irish
Póg mo thóin
ga naakt, word wild, ik ben zwanger van jou kind
point of order, that's pretty spot on Anglo-Irish patios there from a Swede
or how to rob a German-speaking tourist ;)
Irn Bru bars, enough sugar to put you in a diabetic coma, but they were fantastic
Even just typing it out I can feel the sensation of them sticking to your teeth as you ate them
The smell of coal fires
It reminds me of visiting my granny, as some of the houses in her village still had coal fires well into the 90s.
Or saudade
[This] (Jemini - 2003) is the most legendary disaster ever
Technically due to technical issues but it’s still a catastrophe
Even if you take the political voting issue out of it, the U.K. doesn’t really send much good stuff there
We should probably send the Frock Destroyers next time
I also really want for Scotland to get our own entry one day so we actually stand a chance of getting close to the leaderboard at all
Pretty much almost every song we've sent we (The UK) consistently come last or as close to last as possible
> However, I don't think it's actively a bad song, just a disastrous performance on the night
I agree - we've had that issue a lot, between Jemini, Josh Dubovie, Bonnie Tyler
It's like the BBC don't check the people can perform live =/
I bet you if we did, and it was our first year, we’d probably win
Or in U.K. Eurovision terms - actually get any points at all that aren’t from Ireland or Malta
No because of 3 main reasons:
- The charity glorifies war
- The charity supports soldier f
- It makes the government not feel the need to support members of the armed forces since we are donating our own money
Personally I don't (but I'm also not a fan of the peer pressured public perfomance of the minutes silence either)
I'm not particularly interested in public perfomances for these events, nor the weight some sections of the public place on it
Not upset by them or would disrupt anyone doing it, but
I don't need a minute set aside or a badge to remember what my family did or the many people from my village who died in the world wars, whose names sit on the arch to the local cemetery
It feels vapid to me, personally, but a lot do it
Since when was the poppy a nationalist symbol
Am I missing something
To add your flair go to the main sub and press the three dots in the top right (on iPhone at least)
This
I lost family members in the First World War, and I get what it’s supposed to represent
But so many people use it as a sign of nationalism I don’t wear one anymore, probably not since I left school
It doesn’t mean I don’t remember those family members or think about them, it just means I don’t want to wear a nationalistic symbol of the army
Was, it's not 1776 anymore mate
Huh interesting, thanks
Dress doesn't take much of an interest for me so thanks for passing that along

You're late to the party, catch up pal
I prefer it
It sounds a bit clumsy at the moment but I think it will become more normal with time and use
I feel like Czech Republic sounds too long winded and formal and harks back to their communist history
If you consider surrounding countries like Austria and Slovakia too, it’s a good fit
Idk, most people here in Scotland say Czech Republic
Usually changing a country's name (or shortening it) doesn't really get to most places
Most people will probably still call it by its current name
Obviously this isn't the case for everywhere though
It sounds better, saying "Czech Republic" makes it sound like some sort of group
I've had that same thought lmao
Reminds me of a joke I heard ages ago
The Scottish are Jocks, the Irish are Paddies, the Welsh are Taffies and the English are wankers
It was an English guy who told me it
True
People still call the UK "England" to this day even though it's not been a thing since 1707
Not a national flag, rather the flag of the Scottish monarch, but I love the Lion Rampant
I like the Scottish flag a lot as it is presently, but the [Lion Rampant] is pretty cool
We'll ignore English for obvious reasons
In the case of Scots language I believe we're divided into about 10 dialect groups, but with differences within them too i.e. Shetlandic and Orcadian are lumped under "Insular Scots" but the two of them are still fairly different (but much closer than, say, Southern Scots or Ulster Scots)
Doric is very different to glaswegian
Is it quite easy for Turks to communicate with people from Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan etc
Some schools cover some Scots nowadays, generally around Burns Night
Gaelic is taught in some areas but it wasn’t an option for me growing up
The number of schools offering it is increasing though, the main problem is a lack of teachers
I was taught Doric (a dialect from the North East) in school however it was never an official class, just something my primary teacher tried to instill in us
Gaelic is an option in some secondary schools but not many, if it is then it tends to be schools on the west coast
It is officially a language
It's as much to English is as Norwegian is to Swedish
yeah, exactly
they're official languages
the opinion of linguists matters more than the opinion of laypeople on the internet
and the decision to treat scots as a dialect was made by unionist politicians
Within Scotland:
Dundee = tech, Aberdeen = Oil, Everywhere = tourism, Edinburgh = everything else
Within the UK:
Everything = London,
Everything else = London,
Seriously, can anywhere else in the country please get something
= no, London
Glasgow = Drug dealing
No, there's no drug dealing in Glasgow
Just a very active ice cream van market
Yes, but Scotland is a relatively small country and so by just focussing on that I can actually highlight some stuff
By talking about the entire UK, everything just gets eclipsed by London
I think the point is that there is a certain amount of patriotism around the OXFORD/AstraZeneca vaccine, such that the OXFORD element is stressed whereas the equivalent (e.g. BioNTech) is mostly dropped for other vaccines
Just the 3, English (because obvious reasons), Gàidhlig (I'm from that end of Scotland) and Polish (last long-term serious partner was Polish and started learning the language for her family)
Edit: 5
Forgot French and German
Edit 2: 7
Forgot Spanish and Italian like an eejit
Could stretch it to an 8 and be able to recognise Irish because of how similar our languages are but I can't say I know it
I think 11: English, Spanish (Castilian), French, Italian, Dutch, German, Polish, Slovak, Swedish, Russian, Turkish
I try to learn thanks etc when going to another country I could be wrong with some of these
French-merci
Spanish-gracias
German danke
Dutch - dank je
Danish - tak
Sweden - tak
English,French,German,Polish,Hungarian,Italian and Spanish so that’s 7
I’ll guess English too
Tapadh leat for the list
Huh, that's a lot more different from 'tapadh leat' than I expected
Though the Irish one makes sense enough to me
Interesting
Okay I do know them XD Spanish ex-flatmate and Italian cousins
It's less on the point of death as you may think with the recent progress in the past decade to re-educate the youth Scottish culture like what happened in Ireland (but not to the same extent due to our lack of independence)
But to answer your question, on the West Coast of Scotland you'll have a higher chance of someone who knows "tapadh" as "thank you" due to the Highland and Hebridean diaspora focusing on Glasgow and surrounding areas
On the East Coast
You'd be lucky for someone to know "tapadh" outside of vaguely recognising the word exists in the world
Thank you is actually "tapadh leat" or "tapadh leubh" depending on the context :-)
To confirm, I'm from the east coast, didn't know of tapadh leat/leibh until this year when I tried the new Duolingo course and I'm in my thirties
Moved the Edinburgh about a year ago for uni, would you say East Coast is more Scots with Doric being around in Aberdeen
Yep, definitely
Gaelic speakers existed all over but in more recent (last 300 - 400 years or so) times it was more due to immigration rather than it being a native language in the East and central belt (plenty of Gaelic speakers in Glasgow but most had moved there rather than being natives)
Doric is the Aberdeen/Aberdeenshire dialect, reaching as far as Nairn to a greater or lesser extent
Scots itself has multiple other dialects though, the difference between Glasgow and Edinburgh is quite clear at times (bairn vs wean for example)
That's one way of putting it
> I had no idea it refered to "The Troubles"
It doesn't. It refers to the Anglo-Irish War in the early 1920s.

Contrary to popular belief, the Scots/Gaelic word “loch” actually isn’t a direct translation of the English word “lake”. While it can mean lake, it’s definition is actually slightly broader than that, as it can also mean a geographical feature found in Scotland that is similar to a Norwegian fjord
In modern English, these are sometimes referred to as “sea lochs”, but in the original Scots/Gaelic there is no distinction between them
Also (this one is probably more well know), it’s not actually supposed to be pronounced like the English word “lock”, but instead the “-ch” sound is supposed to be pronounced like it would be in German
That sound doesn’t exist in English, so most people outside of Scotland simply pronounce it as “lock”
Oh this is really cool
Just before the Scottish wars of independence we were actually going to have a Norwegian queen, but she died on the trip over so England took control instead
Penalty shootouts
Not the preceding 120 minutes of football, mind, just the penalties

Norway, Sweden and Finland = small in population, but big in landmass, resources, wealth and technology
The UK isn't that big
There plenty countries in Europe that are bigger

I think it's because it's an island which always means that it's clearly defined
It's like medium sized at best
Not exactly a city, but I love Kirkwall in the Orkney Islands
It's beautiful and the people are very friendly
I went on holiday there a couple of years ago and I loved it
It was sunny for once and we got to go swimming in the middle of the city
Tbh I can't think of a single city in Italy that wouldn't qualify as a nice city (for visitors at least, I'm sure locals grappling with local politics and infrastructure problems disagree)
Italians are blessed to live in such a spectacular country
I'd really recommend Galway if you ever get to go
Also I'm biased by Scotland is pretty great - Highlands, Edinburgh, Glasgow
Don't forget places like Aberdeen, Fort William, or Inverness
r/scottishpeopletwitter is pretty fucking legendary
No cunt can understand it either which makes it better
I don't really look at r/all or the popular stream, just the subs I'm subscribed too
Anytime I venture into parts unknown I've stumbled across alt right or incel twerps and that doesn't do a great deal for my mental health
So basically, I usually just see content on things I am interested in
I enjoy the fact reddit is international as I've learned a lot about other cultures, particularly the minutae and day to day stuff you don't normally read about, often largely due to this sub, but also from our American brothers and sisters and elsewhere
Primary 1 and 2 education is more learn about your body and stuff not really sex education since it’s the ages of 4-7
Primary 3 and 4 and 5 you start to learn more about ‘other’ parts but not really in depth as your still kinda young
Primary 6 and 7 is when you start to learn about puberty
In primary school normally it’s just taught by your class teacher which makes for awkward times when I this lady was just talking about dicks then goes onto doing algebra in the next lesson
In secondary school
S1-2 is just looking at puberty but more in depth
I remember also getting some speakers come and talk to us about underage sex since my area had a very high teenage pregnancy rate
S3 we learnt about STDs had to put condoms them on various fruit
S4 we had to learn about sex and what will happen if you get an STD and how to get help we also ‘learnt’ about rape but it was more just how to speak out about it and get help
This is all done by our Guidance teacher so it was a little less awkward then primary school since they were actually trained to talk about this
S5 and S6 your legally and adult so health class is wasn’t really a thing anymore
Parents, and also teachers at school
We get it at like primary 6-7 (I think) here but I think it might be earlier now because my little cousin is learning it and he's in primary 4
I've never gotten anything like "the talk" either, I probably actually learned most things from watching movies and all that
During the Second World War the Polish Army in the West was stationed in Scotland
Many of the soldiers married Scottish women, and didn't want to return to a Poland under Stalinist rule
As a gesture of thanks for the welcome they received, some of the Polish soldiers created the *Great Polish Map of Scotland*, a large 3D concrete map of Scotland
One of the other soldiers of the Polish Army in the West who settled in Scotland was an artillery corporal called Wojciech
Wojciech was unusual for a Gunner, because he was an Iranian Brown Bear
After the Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939, the Polish soldiers that had managed to avoid being murdered by the NKVD were incarcerated in the Soviet prison camp system
The Western powers and Polish government in exile were eventually able to negotiate their release and enlistment into the Polish Army in the West; on their transit through Iran, the Polish soldiers adopted a bearcub, who accompanied them through the North African and Italian campaigns
Wojciech was fond of a cigarette and beer, and was trained by the Polish gunners to carry ammunition forward
After the war, he was rehomed in Edinburgh Zoo, where it was not unknown for former Polish soldiers to enter his enclosure and share cigarettes and play with him
Wojciech - and the Polish Army in the West - are commemorated with a statue in the centre of Edinburgh
On another Edinburgh Zoo related note, the Colonel-in-Chief of the Norwegian Royal Guard is a penguin at Edinburgh Zoo called Nils Olav
The Norwegians were visiting Edinburgh to perform at the Royal Military Tattoo in the 1970s, when they heard that the penguins in Edinburgh Zoo were originally donated by Roald Amundsen, following his successful South Polar Expedition
To commemorate this achievement and celebrate the links between Norway and Scotland, a penguin was selected, given the name Nils Olav, and enlisted in the Norwegian Royal Guard
Apparently Hungarians have a stereotype about Scottish people that we're tight with our money
Not really much of a relation but your average Scottish person will most likely know absolutely nothing about Hungary, probably unable to point it out on a map, so it's weird to think they're sitting over there joking about us
I was actually gonna comment this, but I did some research first to get the facts right and turns out it’s just a myth
The war declaration and peace treaty both use the term “United Kingdom”, which regardless of the Anglo-Scottish border, includes Berwick
Primarily see myself as British/Scottish, but where it makes sense to specify, I'll note being half-Spanish/Catalan (given that is where the bulk of my family is from and lives)
I don't speak Spanish but my brother and sister have learned it to some extent, I just struggle with learning languages badly
I have generally good feelings about Spain/Catalonia, but obviously I disagree with certain things both do, just as I disagree with parts of British and Scottish culture and politics
One half of my family is from Scotland the other half from Ireland, well things seem similar in both so think I'd be ok
Two apocrifal tales involving Robert the Bruce and spiders:
After one of his (many) failed attempts at kicking the English out he was hiding in a cave contemplating giving up and moving to France when he saw a spider trying to make a web
The spider failed time and time again but didn't give up until it eventually succeeded, inspiring Robert to try war again which he won resulting in another 400 years of independence
Same circumstances as the first one, he was being chased by English soldiers and hid in a cave
A spider built a web over the entrance and the English seeing that moved on allowing him to escape and fight again
As the understand it
He was more paid too little money to leave her alone
Scotland isn't a part of England though, what
Not necessarily phrases but the *phrasing* of Spanish we were taught
When I went to Madrid during my gap year, my otherwise fairly fluent Spanish got me funny looks all the time
I didn’t really understand what was wrong until my friend Maria explained that I was basically being *too polite* and “too full” in the things I was saying
I was continually using conditionals for questions, laden with “if possible”s and thank yous unnecessarily where only a couple of words could do
She also told me that I was using “Usted/es” too often and should stop asking people our age if we can “tutearnos”.
It was a hard habit to break since using politer structures was required to get the necessary grades in school
Kind of depends on the social class/age of your audience :)
We got taught the “baiser” kiss thing too
I dated a French guy at uni for a while and while trying to conjure up my rusty French I used it
Turns out that that was totally acceptable for us to do in the end anyway
We used to, but its died out now that most folk use mobiles
My parents (now in their 80s) did it when they first got a landline
I don't, nor any of the younger generations
Mustn't grumble :)
There's one area in Scotland with a couple of small towns I know of that sometimes refer to their town centre as the "precinct". The rest of us think it's a bit weird to be honest
>'Supper' when referring to dinner, I have only seen people referring to 'fish supper' (fish and chips)
What about if you're having a light meal after dinner but before bed
I'd call that supper too
You can also use 'shut up
' to express disbelief
'I won the lottery today'
'Shut up
Very informal though
My pal's mam went to uni in her forties and subsequently became posh
By that point she insisted that her bairns answered the phone "[number], how my I help you
". We used to rip the piss out of him for it, he claimed she periodically phoned the house to check that he was still doing it
Honestly, even the "may I" part is weird enough in Scotland
My grandma used to do it and insist we answer that way
I was surprised to find out other people *didn’t*.
Same in Scottish Gaelic
No word for yes or no, you reflect back the verb in the question
It's quite common in technical writing in general
There's a class element to it
For the upper middle-class supper is an informal evening meal eaten with the family, whereas dinner is a much more formal evening meal
To lower middle-class and working class people, supper is a snack before you go to bed and dinner can be either your midday or evening meal, depending on where you're from
Not that that helps you much ;)  Native speakers from the UK are very attuned to class markers in speech, whether they're aware of it or not
Current slang would be 'You don't like pizza, innit' :)
"Cheers, thanks, ta, thanks".
Really
Do you live near Eton
'Should' has an implication of 'ought to, but don't worry if you can't'.  Shall is more 'you must do it this way'.
Might be more of an English thing, I actually can't remember the last time I heard someone say "shall" to be honest
I do see it in technical documents fairly often though
That's what supper is in my part of Scotland too
(Along with the aforementioned fish supper, sausage supper etc
from the chippie)
Pupils go to primary or secondary school (mandatory education), students go to college or university
Fair enough
We'd go breakfast, lunch, tea/dinner (main meal after work/school, both words used), maybe supper before bed
They can be
It depends on the context
Talking with your mates
Fine, have at it
Job interview
Not if you actually want to get the job ;)
Yes, you're right, it comes from 'isn't it' :)  Does my head in too (but then I'm old ;)  )
I used to play rugby with a guy from Yorkshire who'd use "howdo" as his go-to greeting come to think of it
The North West Higlands are a good candidate
Miles of empty, rugged mountainous landscape
Sutherland is pretty damn empty
The middle of nowhere is a field outside a city, the middle of fucking nowhere is somewhere in the mountains with no sea near by
The Highlands and Islands but ask anyone from the Central Belt and it's anywhere that isn't the Central Belt
Source: From the North East
There's a place very similar not far from you
*Pssst* (It's called Scotland)
People seem to just stay around where they've always lived and where their family is, at least from my experience
Either staying roughly where they're from provided they can afford it (second homes are killing the Highlands and Islands) or often from small to big
Remote working due to the Rona has made some people start look the other way though
Usually, although I personally moved from a larger place to smaller
This wasn’t on a sign, but in a local newspaper advising on how to be a responsible dog owner in a rural community:
“Always keep a tight hold of your dog’s lead around farm animals
Common sense one would think, but it went on:
“Unless you are being chased by cattle, in which case, let go”
Fortunately we don’t have a dog, so if any cattle end up chasing us we should be fine
>At the time, England was hosting the Euro '96 football championships and a Russia vs
Germany match was scheduled to take place in Manchester the following day
Well, Russia vs Germany is always an explosive event
From all the stories I've heard from American Park rangers, it seems they have a chronic problem of incredibly stupid tourists who always manage to kill themselves
Apparently a lot of people think that "National Park = Theme Park" and forget that it's a genuine wilderness
When my friend visited Yellowstone, he saw signs and pamphlets telling people to not try and ride Bisons, not to feed the Grizzly Bears, and not to try and pet or give belly rubs to any wolves
I was being sarcastic, but thank you for the warning
The 6 Nations is huge, and a lot of non-rugby fans will take an interest when Scotland are playing
We only have two professional rugby clubs, Glasgow and Edinburgh, and in terms of popularity, both pale in comparison with the professional football clubs they share their cities with
Club rugby has a small but consistent playing population throughout the country, except in the Borders, where rugby is the most popular sport and football and afterthought
Rugby League exists, but is very niche, and largely played by people that have moved up from its heartlands in the north of England
3rd biggest sport besides from football and drinking
More football than anything else here
I never really hear anything about rugby at all to be honest
I know my neighbour used to play it but that's about as far as it goes
It’s probably the third most popular sport, though it’s kind of seen as a posh sport (definitely posher than Shinty football or golf)
Football is of course miles ahead in popularity, and in terms of people playing it golf is too, although more people watch rugby than golf I’d say
Course in the Highlands it’s Football and Shinty, rugby is not an option
All we got in high school was rugby and "cross country running" which was really the PE teacher telling us to fuck off into the woods so we'd go buy sweets and cigarettes, lazy bastard would just sit in his office for an hour
Oh and in the first year they awkwardly made you dance with girls and called it PE
I think it’s another way of saying American football but I could be missing it completely
yeah, I don't know if you could even keep milk out the fridge without it going bad but I could see how eggs are able to sit out of the fridge
Either way we just keep them in the fridge
I’m the UK yes we do refrigerate our milk and eggs
if you buy room-temperature eggs, you really shouldn't refrigerate them
It can cause moisture to build in the layers of stuff under the shell, and allow bacteria to grow & things to penetrate the egg
If it has been washed and refrigerated before you buy it, then it's fine
> so why not
Because then for many cooking things you have to let them warm up to room temperature to use them
For eggs it seems to be personal preference
I refrigerate mine because I don't have a cool basket thing for them to go in and I'm not leaving the box sitting out
I think most restaurants actually prefer that nowadays
If Irish law is anything like Scots law, you wouldn't have been able to retroactively prosecute anyone who bought, sold, or used during the 24 hours
If you possessed it after the 24 hours when the loophole was plugged then that would've been illegal
However, if any damages were caused during this period by people under the influence, the state would be liable to pay out the compensation due to negligence so long as the damage were physical
But then again, I know Jack Squat about Irish law
In Scots law, damages are only payable so long as they're physical
With rare exceptions, purely economic damage will never be recoverable
If any damages to anyone's property were caused by people under the influence of the drugs (whether true or argued well) then the state would be liable (rather than the actual individual) as it was their negligence in accidentally causing the loophole that directly led to the damages occurring
Because this is purely hypothetical with nothing in my mind similar enough to set relevant precedent, take what I say with a pinch of salt
Disclaimer that I am just a student, and while Ive received my merit pass in delict (Scots law equivalent of tort), I'm in no way an expert
In my opinion it could go a few different ways depending on the Sheriff at first instance
1 - The Sheriff is a traditional fuckwad and outright refuses the claim on the grounds that they made a claim against the wrong party
Without a doubt the pursuers (I believe the word in English law is plaintiff) would appeal upwards, and then it would either be "well, you made a mistake in sueing the wrong party it's your fault you can't claim back" or "we'll say the state is liable and push the case up to ensure you get compensation for damages from them".
2 - The Sheriff is uncomfortable with making a clear decision and pumps it upwards to the Sheriff Principal
A SP would be able to have the authority to direct the claims against the Crown unless the higher court (Court of Session) steps in and tells them to fuck off (which wouldn't happen because the state are the liable ones here)
3 - The Sheriff themselves I doubt would hold at first instance the state is guilty and should pay because they're not mentioned at all in this original hypothetical case
Of course, they ***could*** but they would seriously be risking their position as a Sheriff and destroying any chances to advance up the ladder if they were wrong in any way
I think he works at the actual office and not a bank branch
Office workers in banks tend to work long hours and a lot of the time on Saturday
How would you compliment your S/O in your native language
My missus can speak over 15 languages and last night she dropped the "love you" for the first time and i only found out this morning with googles aid
Why do you think she said that in the first place mate lol
Im pinching that one
Aye cheers pussyblaster im sure you're a credible source of flirtatious material  lol
Doing my nut in lol
I actually couldn't say for certain but it's over 15
She started young and had a love of language (and learning
the lassies a million times smarter than me) but it's funny i only know english/scots and she is terrible at Scots so i one up her there
No in my accent mate it would gie her the boke
She kens how i feel I'm just looking to shock the shit outta her by responding one day
It's not really the done thing here either as it can be seen as cheesey or soppy
I'll say stuff to her like "your no too bad i might keep you" or "when your in this kinda mood your almost tolerable"
Added to my list
Moto moto like em chunky
Excuse me
English
You lot no got enough heat bearing down on you without making that mistake
Significant other
no that she's significant, bit of a pain in the arse but i love the dozy bitch lol
Ye ken the worlds gone mad when the yank gets the patter
She plays the role of C/O (corrections officer/prison guard) sometimes
drinking water out anything but a glass gets me time out lol
Because i hate the word partner and it's my post
We were on an Art trip in france back in highschool and got into a rammy with a bunch of French lads calling us English
I shit you not when an English school group walked past no 5 mins later roars of "Auld Alliance" (well squeels our balls hadnae dropped yet)  went up and we all started pelting them dolly bracelets
I used a coffee mug
What about beer
You try buckfast when you were over here
Much similar but drunk by the bottle
Made you fuckfast though right
Lie to our people
Theres a lot of cunts on that list, and Ive no idea on who's authority they were placed there
He was basically preached against at my school
He was pissed at the Scots for being the wrong sort of Protestant and killed rather a few of us as a result
No, a lot academy/high school girl looks exactly the same because they all get the same shitty orange tan from the same place
Scotland isn't a Northern country but we do have the gloomist city in Europe, it is Glasgow
People here see tans as healthy and yet most of us are pale
Never heard anyone say anything bad from a tan unless it's mega dark from being in sun all the time
Not at all
Many people here enjoy going to places like Southern Spain and Southern Portugal purely to lie by the hotel pool/beach and sunbathe
And people use tanning salons
The Scottish accent makes us sound angry when we pronounce it
I don't know how anyone else in the world views Scottish accents in regards to being uneducated or whatnot other than "haha funny hard to understand lolol" but there certainly are accents here that are viewed on as lower class and upper class, but it's probably more to do with how many Scots words you use other than the accent itself even though that will play a part in it
Upper class people tend to use less Scots words or "slang" and lower class people tend to use more
I've also noticed that upper class people tend to use a flat r (the type you hear in an American accent) other than a tapped r which sometimes really doesn't sit well on my ears hearing it with a Scottish accent
People here are giving very reddit appropriate answers
Sure people on reddit wouldn't consider it weird and most people probably wouldn't care enough to even notice if you were sat down in a restaurant but yeah people who notice are often going to think it's a bit weird
I eat out alone often
I've never felt judged for it, although some restaurants are clearly geared-up for quick individual workday lunches (small tables, perhaps a counter, quick service), while others are expecting larger groups to be there for a while (large tables, slow service, proper table-cloths)
I always take a book with me; if you dine with a book, you are never alone
I used to eat alone in restaurants when I travelled for work
I did get a few odd looks, but mostly no-one seemed to care
It beat eating a sandwich in my hotel room
I don't find it weird, you eat in subway / Kfc along so why not a restaurant
Nope
It's one of those very interesting if slightly mental aspects of the USA in my opinion
Just crazy that it goes on out there and when you read the news articles about bounty hunters busting in guns blazing, even killing innocent people etc
mental
No we don't have bounty hunters
The closest we have in Scotland are [Sheriff Officers] but they are only allowed to operate on the orders of the court and don't have the power to arrest anyone
Today they only legally exist in the US and the Philippines though I'm sure bits of Africa have them in function
The complete reign of the market, unfettered and untamed, is itself a form of totalitarianism
I think a less known Scottish dish that deserves some attention is Cullen Skink- basically a soup made with smoked fish, cream and potatoes
It has a lightly smoky flavour and is delicious
Slice (square sausage) and tattie scone on a roll
Gorgeous
My dad makes that on special occasions, definitely my favourite German dish
> Different stews with lentils, beans, chickpeas and many others
My wife (who is Spanish) calls it 'cocido de no sé qué con cosas' and it's always delicious
I'd also suggest white pudding (oatmeal (prefereably pinhead), onions and pork fat in a skin) and for dessert crannachan (cream, toasted oatmeal and fresh raspberries)
I have always thought Italy has the best cuisine
If I could only eat one for the rest of my life, there would be no contest
Scotland has 6:
[St Kilda]
[Edinburgh Old Town] and [New Town]
[The Heart of Neolithic Orkney]
[New Lanark]
[The Antonine Wall]
[The Forth Bridge]
Edit: I screwed up the link for Antonine Wall
My bad
Fixed it now
Always a debate in the uk about how to pronounce scone, either rhyming with gone or bone
I’m never really sure but scone rhyming with gone is more common in Scotland
We also have all sorts of debates over what to call a bread roll which depends by region eg cobb, bap etc
There is the eternal debate about whether this thing is a *rowie* or a *buttery*.  Generally, wise, cultured toonsers from Aberdeen call it a rowie, teuchters from the shire with neeps for brains call it a buttery
Folk that call it a cookie shouldn't be allowed outside unsupervised, frankly
One set of my grandparents were Polish and staunch raisin in enthusiasts
They passed whilst I was still young but my aunt to this day ruins her cheesecakes with raisins
No, no I’d say most people in England say it like bone
Degenerates, that's who
Cream on one side, Jam on the other; avoids the debate entirely
Scone like cone may make sense but English doesn’t follow simple phonetic rules and in the UK there are so many geographic variations of pronunciation muddying the waters
Official name: The rebuplic of Scotland
Common name: Scotland
(Subtext is that we're independent)
Change Scotland to the Gaelic name, Alba
caledonia, sounds way cooler imo
Change it to just "Britain". The whole "United Kingdom" thing is a bit meh, it's not really much of a name
If that happened an embarrassingly large portion of Scotland's population would think you renamed the country after a football team in the SPFL
Also fuck the Hibs
I wouldn't be surprised if Poland used to become polenland  but got shortened at some point
But surely that wouldn't make sense
The term "Great Britain" is a purely geographical term, and as the full UK includes other places (NI) it wouldn't fit properly
A country without a monarchy
I know that but a lot of people Ive spoken to don't know that Hibernian means "Irish". We're well educated folk, but that doesn't mean there arenae fannys ;)
And whats wrong with Hibs
I support the Heart of Midlothian, we all have our crosses to bare
Love Ireland and the Irish just hate they smell hibs bastards (all in good fun of course)
You'll hear no arguments from me on that one
Whilst we're at it, fancy taking us with them
We could pull the rug for underneath them and dissolve the UK entirely
Aye my Mothers family have Irish roots but my name was mainly chosen because they like Gàidhlig names
I really like Irish names as well and luckily no one will bat an eyelid at an Irish name in Scotland
Edit: to elaborate, their might be the odd bit of clarification required on pronunciation when someone sees it written down but some names like Saoirse, Aisling, Roisin, Niamh, Sorcha (mainly female names I guess) are, if not common, definitely not considered weird or anything
Leith, as in the port in Edinburgh
Or is there a different reason you like it
I don't know if it's shallow or not, but it's cool you've found a name you've liked
Although they may get the odd funny look in Scotland
Absolute nonsense
All the usual popular labels like Nike, Adidas, North Face etc are commonly seen in Europe
In fact, plenty of them are European
Do you mean like fashion brand logos
I'd say your room mate is talking nonsense
Certainly for the UK anyway
- [These kind of North face jackets] are popular with the 'spice boys'.
- Fred Perry is a brand most commonly associated with indie kids and mods, as well some followers of the punk scene
- Adidas Gazelles are also pretty popular with indie kids and mods, as are other styles like München's, Spezial's etc
- [Pretty Green] is another huge brand here in the UK particularly with indie kids
- Stone Island and Barbour are the brands of choice amongst the wannabe football hooligans
- [Napajiri half zips] [K-way] and [this style of black North Face] are some of the popular brands I've noticed amongst the European ultras scene (soccer fan groups)
I could go on
But I need to get home from work
Aye we wear Nikes’ trackies, school bags, shoes and everything else you can think of
You fucking take that back
Not that common in Scotland but some people have it
North Face, Mountain Warehouse, Trespass, Jack Wolfskin are more popular
Maybe even Patagonia
This comment will probably get buried but fuck it, this post is bumming me out so I’m gonna list some compliments about every European country
England: you guys are a laugh and make great panel shows
Wales: cool ass flag and fantastic history and language
The Irelands: great language (not biased) and have contributed so much cool shit to Celtic culture I probably couldn’t list it all if I tried
Also good alcohol
France: fantastic food and a beautiful capital city (I haven’t been outside Paris but I’m sure that’s great too)
We all meme on you a lot, but it’s only because we love you :)
Belgium: best beer in the world, and Tin-Tin was a lot more importantly my childhood than I care to admit
The Netherlands: you have the distinction of being the only country in Europe to conquer *the  ocean itself*, which is objectively awesome
Spain: Brutal as it may be, I have to respect a people who looked at a raging, testosterone fulled bull and thought “I’m gonna fight that thing
with a blanket
”. Also, I’ve spent I surprising amount of time listening to Spanish folk music, and it’s just so fun and uplifting
Portugal: I know very little about Portugal, but your language sounds really cool
I don’t know a single word in it, but it is very pleasing to the ear
Italy: through the Roman Empire, you guys have probably done more to shape Western and Southern European culture, language, and history than any other nation by far
Also, you’ve given us all so many fantastic foods, your general architecture is magnificent
Germany: yours was the first language I ever heard that I loved so much I went out of my way to learn a bit of it
Also, if you guys hadn’t lost WWI, I wouldn’t be here today so thank you for
well, failing at that :)
Denmark: vikings are cool af, and you provided us all with some much needed levity recently by releasing that giant penis children’s show at roughly the same time that the Americans where trying to invade themselves
Norway: y’know what’s cooler than Viking’s? Vikings with mountains
Also your incredibly detailed documentation of your prison system made writing my Adv Higher sociology dissertation so much easier, so thanks for that
Iceland: you have the coolest flag in Northern Europe, your language basically just being Norse is awesome, and the fact that you once grounded all of Europe’s air traffic by lighting up a freaking volcano is metal as fuck
Sweden: IKEA is a godsend, and your meatballs are delicious
Finland: your language is wonderful and I fully intend on learning as much of it as I can as soon as I get bored of German
Estonia: you have the best flag colour scheme in the world and your accent is cool
Latvia: I gotta be honest with you, I know nothing about Latvia, but Riga looks like a very pretty city
Lithuania: the video of one of your politicians being carried away by the police in a plastic bag is honestly one of the funniest things I have ever seen
Poland: you gave me loads of great friends, your food is wonderful, and you gave us polandball which is *mostly* a good thing
Czechia: I know this is probably gonna sound generic, but Prague really is a beautiful city with a hard earned proud history of beer and incidents involving windows
Austria: your mountains are cool, and from the many times I’ve ended up there in geoguessr, Vienna looks really pretty
Switzerland: definitely the country in the mainland I’ve spent the most time in, and for good reason
You’re country is beautiful, and every aspect of Swiss society just seems to fit together like gears in a clock
You’re just so punctual and orderly, you put the rest of us to shame
Croatia: the fact that maps make it look like you just refuse to give Bosnia and Herzegovina any coastline is consistently way funnier to me than it should be
Greece: your history is awesome, your culture and language are just so old and fantastic, and Crete has given me some of my favourite holidays in my life
Also I really wanna visit Thessaloniki at some point cause it looks really nice
Turkey: Istanbul is beautiful, and Turkish food is some of the best in Europe
Romania: my roommate is from Romania and she is one of the sweetest, kindest people I’ve ever met
Also she gave me some Romanian soup spices a while ago and they where great, so I’m definitely gonna try to pick up more of them from somewhere
Ukraine: one of my best friends is from Ukraine so thank you for that
Also your language is really cool, and Kyiv is very high on my places to visit list even though I know nothing about it
Russia: fantastic language, several apparently great cities, and a fascinating history to boot, but please get rid of your current government and stop threatening Ukraine so I can appreciate you more
If you somehow managed to find this at the bottom of this thread, and your country isn’t on here then I’m sorry; it’s not because I don’t like you, it’s because I’m too stupid to know anything about you so please tell me cool and interesting facts about your country
I'd heard all my life that Germany was all about their precision
Then I had to get a train across the whole of germany
Both trains were late, and the 2nd one looked like it was from the 80s and hadn't been updated since
This was on a train trip from Hungary to the Netherlands, and I live in the UK and I'm used to bad trains, but in my limited experience their trains are just the worst
A lot of 'white settlers' in the Scottish Highlands have the same experience
Move there, buy a B&B, sell it after 3 years and move back to Dorset
The weather/bleakness/isolation is not for everyone
I think when people think of Austria they just think of cool mountains and a pretty capital city
And you guys have cool mountains and a pretty capital city, so everyone enjoys themselves and no one gets disappointed
Germany also has a large following for 'alternative' beliefs, e.g. Steiner schools/anthroposophy
Britain
*Modern*? Huh
I thought we where just living up to everyone’s expectations when all that dumb shit went down
>image which Swedes themselves never believed in
You and I must have interacted with different Swedes then
I gotta be completely honest, I’ve never been to Spain and was more being humorous with part about the bullfighting (which is a practice that I personally dislike tbh)
The part about folk music is genuine, but it was frankly the only aspect of Spanish culture I am even remotely familiar enough with to actually compliment with any sincerity
I did think the bullfighting going in there may end up controversial, and I apologise for any offends caused :(
Edit: I should also add that a huge part of the reason I had so much trouble figuring out what to say about Spain is cause there are a cultural things (like food, for instance) that I associate with Spain, but do not know if it is actually Spanish or if it came from South America originally
I didn’t want to accidentally say to you the equivalent of you saying to me “my favourite thing about Scotland is the cowboys, ice hockey, and kangaroos”, so I just went with what I knew
I'd never heard of this either, in Scotland our traditional style of flat (tenements) don't have space for a laundry room, so everyone just has a washing machine in their kitchen
> Papa**dópoulos**
So that means
son of papa
Same here
When I was in Iraq, the Polish and the Czech officers would speak to each other in English - except when the Americans were around, when they'd carry on their conversation in Polish and Czech
Not really, but maybe a little
mostly not really but hmm
just a little
England: yes
[Let us go
I do, I'm a native Scots speaker and a Gàidhlig learner
Also fluent in english but who's got the time for that
I am trying to learn Gaelic, but I've never heard anyone speak it near me (east coast)
I can speak Scots to some degree, which circa 1
5million Scots can speak and most can understand
A can speak Scots a wee bit, which aboot 1
5million Scots can speak and maist can ken
It’s a shame because it was once the majority language in Scotland
Excellent
You should change your username to DèDèDè
Scots has some but not as much as much as you might imagine
Where as gàidhlig is in a totally separate language family
Scots is very closely related to English and sometimes mutually intelligible and sometimes not
Scots does have loan words from Gaelic such as loch and also from Scandinavian languages like bairn (Scots) and barn (Swedish) meaning child
Yeah, I went camping up there and all the signs had Gaelic on as well as English
Yup, that's why I'm trying to learn it
I think the Highland Clearances had a lot to do with Scotland having next to no Gaelic speakers anymore
Lots of money goes into it but I think I've heard of one school that teaches it, and the only place I've ever seen money go into is for train station signs to have the name in Gaelic under it
Seems like a bit of a lost cause at this point, especially considering how many homeless there are
Apparently one of the big men responsible for the clearances gets a bit of a pass because he was a Jacobite, but I don't think that fixes anything lol
>Lots of money goes into it but I think I've heard of one school that teaches it
I know plenty of schools that teach it, including Gaelic Medium education throughout primary
It's just outside of Glasgow, I think all of them are in the Highlands and the Western Isles
That mixed with how the suppression of the Highlands post-Jacobite wars and the Clearances probably indicates the difficulty though: it's not a national language of Scotland but a regional one, specifically of regions the lowlands have historical had very low opinions of, so the language is handicapped that way
That said, there'a still value in keeping funding it, because it keep opportunities in the language available, which at least gives you scope to practice it,  from things like the Mód, to FilmG, to Gaelic radio and television
We aren't gonna qualify for Euro 2020
That all objective studies of policy preferences Scotland is far far less liberal than we like to portray ourselves as
That, outside of sport, all this hating on England is pretty childish
They are alright, they where even the good guys in the last war
That's a weird statistic for what is a very successful ex communist country
Mate, if we meet you in the final you'll fucking blooter us
The Norse God Ajer and big Juicy Elyounoussi are going to carry you guys to the finals
(can you guess what club team I support
I think you're forgetting somebody
I would say I know a bit about most of the Maghreb,
Algeria I know that you had a lot of protests over Abdelaziz Bouteflika and that your most recent political elections didn't go very well because everyone boycotted it
Not sure what happened with that because it fell out of the news with the coròna-bhìoras
Bloody war of independence with the French, but I know Algeria has a close affinity with France as they were colonial overlords for a long time
Other than that I don't know a lot about Algeria, its probably the least we'll known of any north African countries as people travel to Morocco and Tunisia for Tourism ( before coròna-bhìoras) Libya is well known due to the civil wars and Gaddaffi, Egypt as well as its ancient
I think Algeria is very unknown, I don't know lot about Algiers or what it would be like and apart from Oran I don't think I know any other Algerian cities
The other half of Algeria is pretty much uninhabited as far as I know as its just desert
So yes that's all really
If you set it just after that period, you could have a lot of fun with Edinburgh
You'd have the old, rabbit warren half-underground world of the Old Town, as well as the challenge of moving through the open, elegant New Town undetected
The city was starting to come life intellectually, so historical philosophers and scientists could be woven into the story, and then infiltrating Edinburgh Castle would be a great climactic mission
The voice acting would need improvement though
The Scots voices in AC: Syndicate are
not great
I hate that movie its so shit
Love actually is the big one here, which I don't mind so much
It’s a bit of a tradition but Love Actually is probably a bigger tradition now
Also, I watch Die Hard
Neds
Dress like chavs, drink Buckfast tonic wine or Mad Dog 20/20, and listen to George Bowie, Lewis Capaldi and Gerry Cinnamon
Used to be more stabby than their counterparts to the south, now less stabby thanks to the violence reduction unit
Scotland specifically has neds
Wee bams
Deutsches Fliesentisch Museum FTW
We've got both tbf i usually think of Chavs as Neds with soap
The Neds are dying out, they became fuckbois
I speak Scots Gaelic as well as English and idk I just find it really easy to speak Norwegian and Swedish I think some Norse words got into Gaelic or the Gaelic my area speaks since we were a Viking controlled area for many, many years
On top of that Irish Gaelic is obviously very similar with a few different rules but it’s very close
Welsh sounds like you should be able to understand what they are saying but in reality you have no clue what’s going on
Most native Gaelic speakers live in the Highlands and Islands and some in Argyll, Glasgow also has a large Gaelic speaker population, however everyone that speaks it also speaks English I’ve never met someone who can only speak Gaelic
As of 2020 all Scottish Secondary school are able to have Gaelic online classes to help teach people ages 11-18 to speak the language and apps such as dulingo have had support with more people learning Gaelic in dulingo that’s there is Gaelic speakers
We strip them to their underwear, wrap an English flag round them then make them walk down a "leaver " street
Liver disease
Except during the Indian Mutiny, when they decided tying folk to cannon barrels and firing them sent more of a message
Gaelic-medium education is probably the closest thing we have to truly bi-lingual education
Currently, provision is small, although it's been growing steadily since the 1980s, when it was first implemented
Currently, approximately 3,500 children are in primary GME and 1,000 in secondary
As to how well it works, it's hard to say
Gaelic has been in decline, but that's more to do with an aging population and emigration from Gaelic-speaking areas
That said, more younger people are learning Gaelic and learning in Gaelic, so there are hopes of a revival to come
Personally as a young person I think Gaelic could have a bit of a revival
I live in Glasgow so no one I know is a native Gaelic speaker but loads are interested in learning
Wasn’t there a big row with whether or not to make the Western Isles main language of instruction Gaelic and this Tory came out with a stupid comment or something like that
Aye, that concerns me slightly
The biggest growth in GME has been in Glasgow, where most of the pupils will speak mostly English with their friends, and Gaelic will just be what they use to speak to their parents/granny
I sometimes wonder if the Gaelic language strategy should be focusing on consolidation in the core areas first, but then so many young people from the Highlands move to Glasgow anyway
I wouldn't be surprised, although I don't know for certain
Here in Scotland we have a level of devolution with our own parliament
The Green Party and Scottish National Party are pro full independence for Scotland
The SNP are the largest party in the Scottish Parliament and representing Scottish constituents in Westminster
We had a referendum on independence in 2014
It was close but unsuccessful
Most Scottish people voted against Brexit and so there is a resurgence of interest in independence
Data shows that younger people are more likely to vote for independence and older against
Personally, I’m an SNP voter, anti Brexit and pro independence
I am part of the sepratist movement in Scotia
We'll get there one day
I hope
No we don’t...
I mean, my flair says it all
Well a lot of Scots really want independence
This is probably the most well known independence movement in Europe right now
Aye, but probably not that close to it unfortunately
Bit silly to think of the % increase over 307 years of union imo, especially when support increased by ~10% in the two years immediately prior to the vote and has continued to rise afterwards albeit not as dramatically
But there's many reasons that another vote should be held, not least that a pro independence government is looking like it'll win a majority in the 2021 elections, or that Brexit has completely changed the landscape of politics in the UK
And anyway, people change their minds, that's why we have elections every ~5 years
The once in a generation thing was a figure of speech and it's a bit disingenuous to hold it up as some promise of no more independence votes
Much like how Boris said he'd rather be dead in a ditch than have Brexit later than October 31st
Imo another vote will come soon after the 2021 elections and once the effects of Brexit show themselves after the end of the withdrawal period
Burn= old Scottish word for a stream, and a regular burn
But a rifle isn't a shotgun
How is a single letter 4 different words with completely different meanings
That doesn't tie/segue into the other but to conclude; yes, languages are fried
Edit: spelling
But
I genuinely don't know if you're joking or not because the Latin alphabet has all 4 of them written above
I'm very aware I should learn another language but I think Chinese and Japanese are going to be very much out of my reach
Along with Icelandic apparently
I identify as
Scottish
A cunt fae Edinburgh (that's the technical term)
European
British
In that order
Country (as in Scotland, not the UK)
We don't have provinces here, the counties have chopped and changed over the years so don't mean much to people, and my city isn't that big a deal
I imagine some people in the big cities might feel different
Some islanders would identify with the island first (or group of islands, in the case of Shetland or Orkney) but I'm from the mainland
Scottish and Aberdonian; which feels more prominent depends on the context
I grew up with the notion that the UK and Britishness was the default, but it now feels a very foreign concept
Primarily as Highland, and then both Scottish and British
Easier to identify with the Highlands as it feels quite different from the national lowland identities, and yeah, when your region is one of the ones at the bottom of the list of priorities for both levels above, its a bit more difficilt to feel very attached to them
Scotland > European
I don't identify as British, eventhough legally I am
I honestly don't know anymore
After living abroad and working internationally for years, and then coming back to the UK after Brexit, I don't have a sense of place
I feel an attachment to Europe (the idea or concept of Europe and the European Union), but that has been stolen from me by bloody Brexiters
I did have all sorts of local and regional identities, too, but those have eroded
I feel more at home in Kuala Lumpur airport, or Dubai airport, or Changi airport, or Hong Kong airport, than I do anywhere in the UK now
Put me in any upper-range business hotel from Cairo to Suva and I will feel more at home than I do anywhere in my own country
The UK is not the country it was
It has become a sad, disjointed, distorted place - a parody of itself - and I no longer feel at home here
The Britain I miss is a historical one; I can identify with the memory of the British Commonwealth as it existed in the middle of the 20th century, but not really to Britain today
I sort of residually identify as Scottish, but not really - I've been away too long, and now the place just seems sad, abandoned, neglected, provincial, parochial, poor and mouldy
If there's anything else that makes me feel a connection to place, it's a sort of ghostly connection: a connection  to myths, legends, folklore, ghost stories - all those shadowy, fragmented memories of a past that has gone
Gone, gone, it has all gone
That's what I identify with: a place that has gone
That depends if you count Scotland as a region of the UK or a country in its own right - I'm Scottish first then British
If I'm not from my area or talking to someone from elsewhere in Scotland I identify more with my city but not so much around people from here
Scottish first
Then European
If forced to use a level of abstraction deeper, I'd say South West Scotland as I've moved about a bit and don't really identify with one place there
The South West bit is really just where I'm from, not identify
Council areas can have decent identities (Highlands, Western Isles, Northern Isles), in fairness
It's a term of endearment
At least that's what the Weegies say tae us
If you have four Scots in a room then one would be an Aberdonian, one would be Invernessian, one is a Glaswegian, and the last is a cunt fae Edinburgh
Nothing else really works
I guess you could say Edinburger, but that sounds stupid
True, but if you go by the old county system it can get weird
They had Lewis and Harris in different counties from each other
Then you've got the random assortment of scattered enclaves and exclaves that made up Cromartyshire
I imagine that's a reaction to how the English/Scots speaking Central Belt-biased governments, royals and the like have treated them over the years, attempting to wipe out their culture, language and so on
The amount of people around here that are so deluded and think Gaelic was never a thing here is unreal
Never mind all the Gaelic-influenced placenames
Sorry, I wasn’t clear but was only referring to Scotland
Anyone that’s ever met a Yorkshireman knows that English counties are far more important than ours
It's looser in Scotland, and people are more likely to identify with a council area (Highlands and Islands) than counties (Inverness-Shire isn't exactly an identity)
If anything, under council areas smaller local identites might exist, but I don't know what exactly you'd call Lochaber, or Ross, or Skye, other than local areas
My European identity was about belonging to a res publica called the European Union - a massive space across which I had rights and opportunities
That has been stolen from me
I still feel European, but my access to Europe has been blocked off
Brexit can go take a long walk off a short cliff
Yeah, the Small Isles south of Skye were also divided, Eigg in Inverness-shire, the other three sat in Argyll-shire
I'd forgotten that they'd been abolished by 1975 (before my time), and personally I blame the post office for tricking me
Pretty much
Occasionally you'll get holdouts who'll keep writing their address the old way like your Greater Manchester/Lancashire example, generally if they feel their new area is less prestigious than their older one but that's mostly older people
I would still be able to move for a new job in Berlin, Madrid, the Hague or Stockholm
That's what's been closed off
A whole host of job opportunities - jobs that most British people wouldn't even consider because they live in tiny, closed, monolingual worlds
It was very simple: you could see a job anywhere in the EU and apply for it, on equal terms with anyone else in the EU
If you got the job (some needed language skills, but a surprisingly large number of jobs in various technical or specialist fields did not), you could jump on a plane, get your stuff shipped, rent an apartment, and hey-presto you are living the European Dream
Now that opportunity is extremely limited
don't know how much this counts, but the name carl (depends on your accent, lighter accents probably won't have this issue), it always ends up sounding like "carol" since we add an extra vowel because the L at the end is pronounced more like "ow"
Native English speaker but a Scottish accent, seems to be the close proximity of of the Rs and the Ls, they just get all tangled up
Burglary, Architecturally and the name Karl
I don't know anything about the way czechs pronounce things but it's probably the spelling that's throwing you off, try thinking of it being spelt as "joolery"
Beat me to it
I pronounce the L at the end like an actual L though
I actually knew a Scottish guy called Karl, his parents must have been off their nuts
where about are you from
both my a's are the exact same in cancel and car
I also still tap my r with saying carl, I feel like I'd essentially be shifting my accent if I was to use a flat r or if I were to annunciate the L
Cumfurt-able in my accent
If nothing else we tend not to skip syllables in Scotland at least (in fact we end up adding in extra a lot of the time
oh fair enough, I send my condolences
This is just a personal experience and completely anecdotal, but I was in Dusseldorf for the weekend at the end of January/beginning of February 2020 and witnessed about 3 or 4 fights on the Friday night in the outside areas of a few different bars in the altstadt
On the Saturday evening the police had to close a street in the altstadt because some Fortuna Dusseldorf and Eintracht Frankfurt fans decided to have a scrap (the two teams had been playing earlier in the day)
My experiences of the UK and Germany are pretty similar - most of the drunken violence happens in small towns where there's not much else to do
I've followed my team around Europe, and the worst trouble I've seen at the football has been in Madrid and in Groningen
This is thread is full of stereotypes, and most of them are fairly off
It'd be like starting a thread entitled, *why are the Spanish such bull murdering savages, when the English only hunt foxes
My experience lines up with yours
Not sure why some continentals seems to think we're more antisocial than them
Possibly just the prevalence of English language media that reports on these fights when they occur, dunno
New Zealand feels very similar to the UK, with a lot of the South Island feeling very similar to Scotland
There’s the obvious cultural similarities, but even the landscape feels familiar
I was driving in the South Island and there were lots of places where I could just as easily have been driving in the Highlands of Scotland
Parts of the North Island reminded me of the South of England
Dunedin is literally the furthest city on Earth from my home, but it feels familiar in many ways
It’s named after Edinburgh and even has the same street names as Edinburgh
The area by the sea is Portobello, after the same area in Edinburgh
The city was even founded by the nephew of Scotland’s national poet, Robert Burns
I found myself instantly very at home in Tanzania
I’ve no idea why because on the face of it it’s very unlike Scotland
But everything seemed so familiar in a way that I’ve not experienced anywhere else
I agree with this
The sheep farming, the landscapes, it all feels oddly familiar
Apparently New Zealand's Maori name [Aotearoa] means "Land of the Long Clouds" too haha
We only had one or two lectures left at uni so we got YouTube videos
We have a town called Dumfries
It's pronounced like dumfreasse
Piper Alpha
168 men died on a burning oil rig because someone lost the bit of paper saying a high pressure valve was welded shut for maintenance
The film *Fire in the Night* about the disaster is incredibly well made and very moving
I see a sucpicous lack of Germans here
Brexit
Basically a lack of safety protocol and mismanagement lead to nearly 200 workers dying in a fire and explosion on an oil platform
Your accent is so strong
What
I don't understand what you're saying
Nah, normally it's something about Haggis, Whisky or Kilts
Oh, and nobody eats deep-fried mars bars
Don't forget the classic "what clan are you from
Ah yeah, the classic American line
Along with the customary "I'm Scaaaaaaattish too
My great-great-great-grandfather was from the McAllister clan
Not even slightly, utterly gutted
We have had snow in the Highlands, but in Glasgow/Edinburgh there hasn't been any
Oddly not unless you head out to the munros (mountains >3000ft tall) however it has seemed to snow later and later in winter for the last few years so maybe we'll see some yet
Just a wi bit a couple of days, nothing major at all though
We seem to often get our big snow in like March-May these last few years though
That one famous picture of nessie probably
European Portuguese (no offence, Brazil)
When my ex-girlfriend spoke to her flatmate in rapid-fire Polish it sounded like birdsong (if there's a bird that interrupts its normal twittering with *tak
tak
tak
tak
tak*...)
That said, I've also heard other folk speaking Polish and it's not very nice at all
Spanish is pretty good, Arabic spoken by someone who isn't nuts also sounds pretty good
Ma ain yin
Maist eh yees dinnae ken i'.
But which one
The Irish one or the Scottish one
(pretend you can't see my flair: no pressure, I won't be offended)
Nice username, our national dish
^^^the ^^^one ^^^that ^^^isn't ^^^heroin
I'll see what I can do
I understand what you mean, fair enough
There's just something about European Portuguese that I really like
Yeah, this is true, even when we speak English it's noticeable
It makes it a bit easier for me to roll the R when I speak Spanish, so it's useful I guess
True, and it makes sense to be fair
Aren't the Windsors kinda mostly german than actually english
You just have to be a British citizen to hold executive office in the UK, its not like the USA where only American-born citizens can be President
Yeah they’re basically more everything but English now
Oh crikey that's something I never thought about
but I would assume it doesn't matter as if you're abroad when you give birth you can still get the child registered back home (at least in the UK)
My gran was born in South Africa and registered in Ayr, I was born in San Diego and registered in Glasgow
We have Oversees Birth Certificates you can order through any British embassy for a fee
This isn't required for citizenship though, the only requirement there is that one of the parents is also a British citizen
The States, though, seem to be fairly similar
From what I recall for Presidency, you need to either be born 1) on American soil 2) on the soil of an American dependency (eg Puerto Rico because the USA are still as imperial as the rest of us ex-empire Europeans
Funny how a Puerto Rican \*can\* be elected President but \*cannot\* vote in any presidential elections) 3) to two US citizens and lived in the USA for a set amount of time (this is off the back of trying to remember studying politics 4/5 years ago
i think like 30 years maybe
Blood in your veins is blue
It infact, is not
I'm glad nowadays we can just set our phone to AM/PM and change it to 11:59am and see what happens
They aren't (internally) contradictory, the just make no fucking sense
*Apocalypse SNow
- Roads chaos as Hurricane Ringpiece brings arctic blast
The country falls apart as the first real winter storm kicks in
Or, if that doesn't happen,
*Snow Business
- Scottish ski centres face collapse due to lack of snow
[Yes, I know hurricanes are tropical storms, and wouldn't be bringing a weather system laden with snow, but our newspapers are not famed for their accuracy]
>The national high school exams are often considered prime exciting news, even though they always happen at the same time and in the same manner
Do you get the "kids open results live on national TV" event as well
We always have some story about exam problems, grade inflation, some kid starting a petition because the maths exam was hard, etc, every May, then by August we have shots of kids getting their results during an interview, with at least 1 kid who failed and didn't get what they needed
Any Burns work, really; but by far and away the most well known anywhere is '*Auld Lang Syne*'.
Should auld acquaintance be forgot,
and never brought to mind
Should auld acquaintance be forgot,
and auld lang syne
'*To a Mouse*' is the probable runner-up, because of John Steinbeck and because everyone did it in school
But, Mousie, thou art no thy-lane,
In proving foresight may be vain;
The best-laid schemes o' mice an' men
Gang aft agley,
An' lea'e us nought but grief an' pain,
For promis'd joy
'*[A Man's a Man for a' That] (also known as '*Is There for Honest Poverty*') is a personal favourite, though
A prince can mak a belted knight,
A marquis, duke, an' a' that;
But an honest man's abon his might,
Gude faith, he maunna fa' that
For a' that, an' a' that,
Their dignities an' a' that;
The pith o' sense, an' pride o' worth,
Are higher rank than a' that
Then let us pray that come it may,
(As come it will for a' that,)
That Sense and Worth, o'er a' the earth,
Shall bear the gree, an' a' that
For a' that, an' a' that,
It's coming yet for a' that,
That Man to Man, the world o'er,
Shall brothers be for a' that
Best known line in Scotland is by far from the iconic Rabbie Burns:
"Fair fa' your honest, sonsie face, Great chieftain o the puddin'-race
From the Address to a Haggis
In Scotland it would most likely be the first line of "To a Mouse by Robert Burns"
>*"Wee, sleekit, cowrin, tim'rous beastie,
O, what a pannic's in thy breastie
In Scotland we celebrate Robert Burns every year in what is called Burns Night
People get together and have a traditional meal (Haggis,neeps and tatties) and a Burns poem is recited
There are many meals organised by small communities and organisations and its a good way of getting out and meeting friends especially for the older population
Even if people don't celebrate burns they will still have haggis for a meal around that time of year
Throw in a dash of Angel’s Share and Neds and we’ve just summed up a country
That’s true, I forgot that part
Aside from the universal commandment of "don't be a dick"; assuming we're part of England is not a way to make friends here
Terrorist shit
The locals will set you on fire and toe your baws
obviously you can acknowledge the fact but I wouldn't bring it up, it might annoy some people even if they don't show that they're annoyed
Depending on where you are and who you’re talking to, you could get hurt or into a massive argument
Some Scots are happy with being British citizens, some are not
All of them know the legal status
I don't see why you'd need to *acknowledge* it - it's something they already know
Pointing out the legal fact of someone's citizenship when they're talking about the emotional subject of nationality and identity is a bit of a non-sequiter, and is often used as a way of dismissing someone's opinion, so I'd advise against it
Because we aren't English
I'm also a Canadian myself and as one I really don't like being called an American either because I'm not American and I'm happy not to be
I'm British sure but I'm also Scottish and that's a very distinct identity from English
Offer to buy them a drink, and chat to them
We're generally quite 'Northern European', so tend to be quite reserved with strangers until alcohol comes into the mix
In terms of the humour, being able to take a joke, and being willing to make a joke at your own expense are seen as important, otherwise it can be seen as arrogant or standoffish
No, they're soldiers and the UK has pretty strict rules about when and how military aid to the civil power can be used
The actual guarding is done by the police these days
>Oh, is that how British people do X? You Brits sure say X a lot
It's my first time in Britain, really enjoying it thanks
etc etc
Sure, all those are fine, as you say, uncontroversial observations of the sort a visiting tourist might make
"acknowledgement that Scottish citizens are British citizens" is a bit different, to casually (correctly) referring to Scots as British though
It's making it specifically about citizenship that makes it weird
There's a lot of internet fannies that try to use that argument, as jf I'm suddenly going to say "oh, you're right, I've just checked my passport and you're absolutely right
Time to stop campaigning for independence
", And not, "well, for now, anyway".
As for a tourist doing it in real life - it would be highly odd
> Yes well, the day that people start stooping to the lows of the internet in real life is the day that the sane people need to jump off a bridge
I agree wholeheartedly
Sadly, it appears to be something our politicians need reminded of from time time to time
Do people here really think it's a luxury
I would describe it more as a go-to budget furniture place for most people
Every student goes there to buy stuff for their flats/halls of residence, and young families will get the bulk of their things there as well when moving in/renovating
Besides that, it's seen mostly as a day out for families/couples which starts off fun (look, the wardrobe has a funny name
) and ends up in divorce
>IKEA has always been seen as a de facto luxury brand
This is just untrue
It's seen as affordable furniture shop with easy to assemble products
>DAIM bars and licorice are seen as exotic
Really
I can go into any supermarket or corner shop and can buy a Daim bar
Any half decent sweetie shop worth its salt sells liquorice all sorts
They're both as common as muck
1945 Iron Curtain line = Wrong

Obligatory Fawlty Towers quote

It's so obvious and overdone I can't be arsed quoting it
How do you get that they 'aren't Europe' from what I said
I thought you were from gay before I read Ireland
Austrian / Bavarian smoked cheeses are my go-to burger topping
There's loads
My town (Aberdeen) has a particularly high Polish population and we've got tonnes of Polish grocery shops and delis
All the big supermarkets, and even some of the smaller places as well, all have a decent selection  of Polish goods too
It's pretty good for me as I had a Polish girlfriend for five years so I acquired a taste for a lot of your country's cuisine
I'll be damned if pierogi, topped with fried onions, chopped bacon and sour cream, isn't one of the greatest comfort foods ever created
Gołąbki, bigos, kotlet, all the soups, salads and sausages
you guys do food right
Yeah theres a few polish shops
There used to be on in my town but its been closed for a while now
Yes, both Polish grocery shops and Polish sections in some supermarkets
I prefer the Polish mustard and Polish red cabbage to the normal varieties
I also like the Słask sausages and Tyskie beer
Yes
I come from Aberdeen where there's a large Polish population in an area called Torry so Aberdeen has quite a few however since moving to Glasgow I've noticed there are less but still a few dotting about
Most supermarkets even have a little Polish section
Scotland is full of them after a lot of Poles moved here after WW2
Off the top of my head I can think of one in Glasgow,  a butchers specifically I'm sure
It always looks great from the window but ive never been in
My mother will buy nothing but Polish bread these days - and I love kabanos
Finland, it’s cool
(Pun definitely intended)
Germany, over the last 200 years they have seriously influenced the shape of Europe, but all a lot of us remember is UK/France (napoleon) and ww1/2 (albeit huge German involvement in all of these
Sweden, especially the great Northern war, I always find it interesting to think about what if Sweden won that war and was/is a world superpower
I find Germany's history interesting
I love learning about the Holy Roman Empire and the time around unification in the 1870s-. Germany's facinating history always gets brushed off to the side due to WW2
It's sad
I’m from Scotland (directly invaded by vikings) and we weren’t taught about it either
Some schools/courses focus on certain things or are just shit
Edit: Just to clarify I mean not taught about Scandinavian history
Yeah that's weird because we were definitely taught about vikings in primary
We do get taught about vikings in primary, I'd expect all schools to be more or less the same
Probably back when the Romans were trying their hands with us but the Picts scared them too much
I wanna see what the Picts looked like
The week running up to and including the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314CE
I would love to get into the mindset of the men who fought and won that battle
What were they thinking knowing that they faced an army that was superior in every way
How did they celebrate after they won
What was the battle actually like
There's a very interesting period in British history between 1660 and 1707
During this time (between the Restoration of Charles II and the Treaty of Union) the social and moral strictures of the Puritan Reformation fell away
There was a renewed sense of freedom in society, with a flourishing of culture and the arts
This was the great age of the first coffee houses - where people met to talk, discuss and do business
It was also a time of scientific advancement - The Royal Society was founded as the Western world's first public research institute
The ideas of Newtonian physics were changing how we understood the world: we could see things in terms of predictable cause and effect, not random acts of God's will
Sir Christopher Wren was rebuilding London
Journeys of trade and discovering were opening people's horizons
London got a proper stock exchange - The Royal Exchange - transforming the economy from an essentially agrarian one to one in which money could be moved and invested
Politically, the long-running dispute between King and Parliament, which a generation before had brought about civil war, came to an end
The moderate compromise reached by the Glorious Revolution of 1688 laid the foundations for peace, stability and prosperity - as well as imperial expansion
It really was the crucible in which modernity was forged
I'd go see what really happened to that lost Roman legion
Probably around 2,000 years ago when the Picts were around
There's virtually nothing known about them at all or their language, so even though it's not like anyone would ever be able to go around and communicate at all it would still be cool as hell just to see them operate and do whatever they might have done
The only things they've left behind (from what I know anyway) are carvings in caves/stone monuments, jewelry and some of their bones
I know the Spanish national anthem's lyrics off by heart
Scottish, Irish in both Irish and English, Welsh’s tune, the British one, the French in lyrics, German tune, Swedish tune, Italian tune and the Russian lyrics(soviet words from memes)
Not really
I'm the one who's usually being misunderstood lol
I struggle with some Glaswegians - I think it's the speed they talk at rather than the accent itself
Dialects are a different matter; folk from Shetland have a similar-ish accent to my own, but the dialect is beyond me
Where you from pal
It's alright, even if you're from Peterheid
There's an old Yiddish cliché that "a language is a dialect with an army and a navy".
The implication here is that the army - and Swedish state in general - conducts all its business in Swedish, therefore Älfdalen is just a dialect of Swedish
When I was young it snowed every year at winter, until a few years ago it hardly ever snowed, now it’s snowing more often
Not really common at all, it wouldn't be surprising at all if we went a whole year without it
Quite a bit it just doesn’t set
We get snow in random points too, we’ll have nothing in January or December and then snow in May and June
It’s snowed more times on my birthday (mid April) than Christmas Day
Whereabouts in Scotland are you based
I'm in Glasgow and last winter was the first winter with no snow that I can remember since I moved here
Fife
To be fair the weather is really boring and mundane on the east coast, how much snow are you experiencing on the west coast
And how long ago was it since you've moved
I've been here four years; moved down from Aberdeen where it snows in summer (I exaggerate
slightly)
In the UK it is the same as Kosovo, but in most of Europe I believe it’s the other way round
Here we do the same thing I think
Example, a thousand and twenty three pounds and fifty four pence would be written as £1,023
Try writing documents to any ISO standard and having them reviewed by someone from continental Europe
This
I thought I was the only one that did it this way
I was taught this way in Scotland and it weirds people out whenever I use it lol
It is weird, I've never seen that before
My P7 teacher taught us to use it because of something like other countries using it
It was many years ago so I don't remember
All I know is that it stuck with me and I still use it
Brazilians used the Portuguese variant until recently, I still hear the elderly use it at least
It's interesting to know, I'd never used before or really seen it
Almost everyone I know is an atheist, so it’s kinda seen as the default
It’s usually weirder to meet a religious person than an atheist, and it’s especially strange meeting a religious person who actually follows the rules of their religion
No one really cares if you're Atheist or not, at least not in my experience anyway
The most extreme it'll ever get in regards to religion is most likely gonna be Celtic v Rangers which is essentially Catholics v Protestants
I’ve always been confused about religion in Ireland, cause I’ve always had the idea of Ireland as being really religious, but your prime minister is gay, so what’s up with that
Is it just that the religious people are really strongly religious but a lot of people just aren’t religious at all, or do I just have a really warped view of Ireland
would do a solid impression of mel gibson's william wallace
not really into the snp but she seems like a nice person
boris is a moron, tories are tories
He is a liar, a charlatan, a bigot, and a classist wanker
And he has a bad haircut
The usual go to for Unionists in Scotland & England is to call Sturgeon "Wee Jimmy Krankie"..
[here
tory is pretty much synonymous with cunt, i stand by my original comment
I've been wondering about that too
Vile personality, not even attractive
Must be the money
I've heard both *-pest* and *-pesht*. It seems to depend on the individual here
I've never heard pesht at all before, but then again it's not like I encounter mad budapes(h)t fanatics that are always saying the name
I say *-pesht* and *chor-ee-tho*, but avoid using the local name in English if the English language name is different, e.g. Moscow, Warsaw, Cologne etc
I was over on Budapest for the Scotland game a couple of years ago, so that's where I was hearing loads of Scots saying it*.
*Except the persistent handful of dafties that kept saying Bucharest instead - thankfully their pals had arranged the flights
Russian, Arabic, and Mandarin
I've been gifted Dostoevsky books (in English) but I'd love to read them in actual Russian, I feel like translations can never do the author true justice
Mandarin because it's writing system and tones are completely alien concepts to me
I don't think I'd ever learn to actually speak this language through conventional means
Arabic because I really want to delve deep into the heartland of /r/arabfunny
Korean, Yiddish, and then Russian
I have lots of Korean friends and we all communicate in our second language so it'd be nicer if there was no barrier, Yiddish for heritage and being able to read interesting historical documents, and Russian because I study Eastern Europe
French - I know quite a bit of French already but id love to be fluent
Mandarin - I'm learning it at the moment and it's such a fascinating lanaguge and chinese culture is is so interesting
Gaelic - just for the culture and the heritage even though it would be pretty useless
Why are you planning on moving to the Faroe Islands
Sounds like an interesting tale
Both the UK and RoI don't routinely arm all police, because we kind of want to remove that antagonism (I think one of the Irish respondents said it came after the Irish Civil War for them and they understandably wanted to remove firearms from how the government interacted with its citizens there to help heal and have police as part of the community; while in the UK it wasn't really needed before the Brixton Riots and the many police reforms after the many riots caused by antagonistic \*unarmed\* police behaviour meant that the focus was placed on community involvement and cooperation - 'policing by consent' is the common term used here - instead of further widening the divide and distrust by arming them)
Or simpler put, they aren't strictly necessary for the vast majority of police functions in the UK or Ireland, they provoke distrust when they do become more common (from the [Press & Journal] a Highland newspaper, 'constituents have been in touch to say that on encountering police officers in shops or on the streets or at charity events, they do not feel safe', and from the [BBC] 'the population want to see a community-based police service, not a routinely-armed police service')
It's just not part of the culture here, and in a way how we distinguish our police from our military: the police work for us, so here it feels ominous if they are routinely armed as if in opposition to us
But this is probably helped by never having really been much of a thing in the British and Irish isles other than in the exceptional case of Northern Ireland
We call it Armed Response, because its a response that's armed
They do seem to go full on one way or another, it’s either unarmed or rifles, very rarely something between
Good at keeping crowds from one another to avoid brawls at games, as I understand it
I live in Netherlands now and to say it's excellent is an understatement
It helps everywhere is flat but they basically have an entirely separate road network for bikes
I cycle 5k to work and I share the road with cars for maybe 1km of it and even then that's little quiet suburban streets
Compare that to Scotland where it's hilly, wet and our streets were not designed with cycling in mind from the offset it's a world of difference
Cycling down Edinburghs cobbled streets is not a pleasant experience on a road bike for example
We have a bike share system in Glasgow that is pretty decent but in terms of the infrastructure which allows cyclists to cycle safely it was practically non-existent in Glasgow prior to lock down
During lockdown though, the city council coned off certain lanes on roads that are dual carriageways and then put in more permanent features to ensure cars can't drive in cycle lanes
And it's pretty disjointed at best
Oh, there is two existing cycle lanes that are actually good
But they are opposite sides of the city centre, completely disconnected from one another and only cover a couple of hundred metres of both streets
It's very uncommon in the cities most people walk or take public transport and then driving in the suburbs and rural areas
From Scottish gov:
Car 65%
Walk 21%
Public transport 11%
Bike 2%
Rest other%
It's not too bad for me in Glasgow, but it could definitely be a lot better
Luckily I live on the main national cycle network route taking you through Glasgow
Basically we sit down, have a nice cup of tea and I listen to my Mum and my Grandma’s lovely conversation slowly turn into an angry political debate

In scots (particularly Doric) this a grammatically correct and understood sentence;
"Fit fits aht fit
Fit 1 meaning "what".
Fits meaning "foot"
Fit 2 meaning same as in English to get "what foot does that fit
More so the accent
being Northern Irish living in Scotland this confuses people all the time
if someone asks, for example "Where are the Scissors
" And I say "There they are, there
" It comes out as "Thur Thur Thur
Or "fit fit fits fit fit"
"What foot fits what foot" when trying on shoes
I've never heard it as "fet" mysel
Some people have already answered for the UK so I’ll do Scotland specifically:
•William Wallace
•Robert the Bruce
•Mary Queen of Scots
•Robert Burns
•Bonnie Prince Charlie
• Walter Scott
•Charles Rennie Mackintosh (maybe
Robert the Bruce
William Wallace
Mary Queen of Scots
Rabbie Burns
Charles Rennie MacKintosh
Bonnie Prince Charlie
Macbeth
Robert de Bruce
William Wallace
Marry Queen of Scots
&#x200B;
I think are the most famous
Am I having a stroke or wasn’t Columbus Italian and went to the Spanish royals because the other ones (? Portuguese) weren’t interested
I don't know Mackintosh
I wonder how many know vaguely the name Canmore (Malcolm III Canmore)
I wonder how well known Robert the Bruce, William Wallace, and Bonnie Prince Charlie are in the rest of the UK
I know Wallace got bumped up by a film, but the other two are sort of more prominent here
Braveheart was actually used in my high school history lessons as an example of a terrible ‘historical’ film
I’d put David Livingstone, James Watt, John Knox, John Logie Baird, Alexander Fleming and Alexander Graham Bell into the ‘second tier’ of well-known Scots in Scotland
Selkirk, Liddell, Smith, Clerk Maxwell and Napier not even
close, not for my generation anyway
> I don’t know Mackintosh
Where abouts do you stay ? He’s pretty well known in Glasgow
I vaguely know of the Malcolms but the name Canmore doesn’t ring any bells for me
Thanks
Clearly I’m not misremembering
My brain just short circuited a little reading your comment wondering if I had gone mad, haha
We did the same in second year if I recall
Highlands
Also studied in Edinburgh a long while
No idea what that Mackintosh did
Only Mackintosh that comes to mind is a local lord who owns the Commons and is the patron for an old folks home, but thats definitely not national
Yeah it was around that time for us, during the Wars of Independence block
My teacher fucking hated that film with a passion
I guess it was a bit silly of me to put CRM above many of the ‘second tier’ famous Scots, it was an attempt to shoehorn a well known artist in
As for Alexander Selkirk the only reason I’ve heard of him, without wishing to sound like an American who’s just discovered ancestry
com, is because according to my dad we’re related to him
Never did anything about Robinson Crusoe in school
I’d argue that knowing about prominent scientists and engineers is a bit more niche than knowing about swashbuckling freedom fighters and famous royals
My science lessons in school weren’t really focussed on the history of the subject
James Watt lived and worked in my home town so he‘s well known there
If you visit the national museum you’ll certainly learn about them though
It’s just a guess based upon how I learned about famous figures growing up, its probably different for many other folk
Fair enough, I was trying to include more folk from the arts so it wasn’t just nobles + Robert Burns
He was the most famous Scottish artist/architect/designer I could think of
The Art School building in Glasgow that’s constantly burning down is one of his
Mine did too
I found out a few months ago that the guy is now a convicted paedo so I suppose I'm glad the film bothered him so much
My brother who is into the arts knows him, but it might depend on people being interested in the arts to know him
I thought you meant Wallace for a minute there I was confused haha
I did think about RLS but as authors go I’d say that Walter Scott probably edges it
He did invent the modern shortbread tin Scotland after all
The fucking big monument in Edinburgh doesn’t hurt his fame either
Probably a bit of central belt bias on my part as well
Nah, auld Mr Czemerys
I’m vaguely aware of Ossian
Is it definitely bullshit ? A quick skim of the Wikipedia doesn’t give me a definitive conclusion
If that’s true then it’s a shame
The existing legends were more culturally significant and probably just as interesting
Romanticism is a hell of a drug
"It's not like it's real money" - drunk Englishman, probably
I once knew someone who went on a 10 minute rant about the word knife and all our other silent letters lol
It depends, cases here have reduced to single figures and we haven't had a death in a couple weeks but think it is inevitable folks are gonna bring it back from holiday
Just really worried we have to go back into lockdown
I feel pretty good about it because in Scotland our infection rates are very low and I trust the government will take measures to keep the kids safe
Also kids are the last likely to catch, spread and be badly affected by the virus and education is very important so I think they should go back
I'm not trying to say that education's not important and schools need to be shut forever or anything, but wouldn't kids be the most likely sort of people to catch and spread the virus about
You're giving the government far too much trust
When there was a spike after the pubs in England were opened back up big Boris said he didn't realise that the virus could be spread if whoever had it showed no symptoms, even though everyone knew that from the very start and is literally the entire point in the lockdown
The UK government is a big pile of shit and basically just flat out lie
Don't forget that time Dominic Cummings (Boris' special advisor) broke the lockdown rules to go and see his parents and changed his story about why and then said he drove even farther to test his eyesight out
It's honestly so dumb it's almost funny
I think in general kids spread colds and things a lot but I'm not an expert or anything but from what I've read from scientists the younger you are the less likely you are to spread Covid hence why kids under 11 don't have to social distance
Id rather keep other stuff - pubs etc closed to keep our level low and open the schools and put the kids first
Happy to be wrong though if there is opposing research casue again this is just what I'm reading from others
When Winston Churchill was chastised by a woman saying "if I were your wife I would poison your tea", he responded "if I were your husband I would drink it"
This may not be the exact words but;
>Give a man a fish he'll eat for a day, give him a fishing rod and he can feed himself
Alternatively don't poison the waters, sell his great grandfather into slavery and turn up on your gap year 400 years later talking a whole lot of shite about fish

We have a few but the best is the Duke of Wellington statue in Glasgow with his iconic street cone hat (and last I saw a mask too)
It’s probably [this statue of the Duke of Wellington]
It’s nothing special: a 200-year-old statue of the commander at the Battle of Waterloo, but for some reason people put a cone on his head
The police take the cone down, it’s replaced the next day
On an on for years
They tried raising the platform under the statue to prevent it; there was a protest to stop them
Sometimes it gets political (there was recently an EU flag cone on it), sometimes the horse gets a cone
It’s stupid and fun and that’s Glasgow
the town I live in has J.M.Barries birthplace, the Peter Pan guy, so I guess that counts
In Aberdeenshire, there is a castle every 2 meters
Edinburgh Castle
Òrd in Scottish Gaelic
That could work
But it's pronounced 'orsd', so it has a kind of a soft sound in the middle :)
I'm not sure that hurts it much, a kind of 'st'/'tch' noise isn't very soft
Still sounds a bit like a hammer dropping imo
I hear it more as somewhere between 'orsd' and ''orshd' :)
Possibly a little down to the individual speaker, tbh
Writing down the sounds in English was always difficult, like the 'b' in Alba being a mix of B and P, or for me the final 'g' in Gaidhlig curling up from the G noise to make a 'cuh' noise are the roof of the mouth like in 'crack'.  We're probably squibbling over basically the same noise, such with more or less emphasis depending on the speaker
Sort of like how some say Alba like 'Al-ah-pa' while others flatten the middle vowel so it sounds more like 'Al-uh-pa'.
Indeed :)
Fuck knows but I'm pretty fucking skint with a lot of 0's in my account

Well the south is pretty urbanised and the north is one of the most rural parts of Europe
Most likely a bunch of incompetent farmers in the north now and a bunch of rather bad insurance salesmen in the south
Population would start to resemble Scotland prehighland clearances, majority in the Highlands, minority in the lowlands
Yes and litterly no one in Edinburgh and Glasgow
Imagine living in the Borders next to

nae chance
Nah, Edinburgh and Glasgow would get the populations of Fort William and Inverness
We're not complete barren up here, just mostly
Not as real as the fact they're ignoring the entire country of Scotland
I was talking about vanguard_SSBN, who has a UK flair, not an England flair
>u/All-Shall-Kneel didn’t. And, with respect, most of you wants to leave the UK anyways (which is totally your call
Frankly I’m jealous)
We had a pretty high profile vote that says we don't.
What's the overall attitude in your country like towards men peeing in public
As an example answer: in mine, it's expected that you are super discreet about it, to the point that it would be hard for someone to accidentally see you doing it
Like, it's expected that your whole body (not just the parts that obviously should be kept hidden) is completely hidden from view and you're at least ten metres away from the path so that no-one can hear it
Of course, not everyone follows that, especially if they're drunk, but they tend to get dirty looks from members of the public - and, if they're exceptionally unlucky and the police happen to be nearby, fined
Sorry about them, we don't like them back home either
You can go just a few steps off the path if you are completely certain there's nobody else around
Problem is, hiking can be quite popular in some areas and you never know when a quiet walker is just around the corner, especially in the forest
And when they are open, making you pay a pound for the privilege of keeping our streets clean
Oh I'd certainly be surprised if "don't show your dick" wasn't a universal rule at the least
Interesting, I kind of asked this question based on a experience I had in Spain once
So I was out with a couple of guys and all three of us needed to pee
So, they said, let's use this cluster of bushes over here
"Wait, shouldn't we find somewhere a bit more hidden from view
"No, it's fine bro, as long as your dick isn't showing people won't care if they see you doing it
Al dente or Al throw it in the trash
Hell yea lad
I had always hated pasta as a child, because I'd only grown up with 'British Bolognese' (which my mother made with peas and carrots in, according to some terrible 1970s recipe)
Then at university I had an Italian flatmate who taught me how to make proper pasta, and proper pasta sources
It's been one of my regular favourites ever since
That's a really good way to describe it
The first time I went to Ireland was  mid-October, it was sunny and the temperature was in the mid-teens but the air was fucking cold, even compared to Scotland
We did this in Peru and I never quite got used to it
Not that bad though
Sounds devine
Scots know about it, because we have shinty and there's an annual compromise match between Scotland and Ireland
He was (acting) horrified because it was going to cost him money, not because it's unusual
he had his military socks on
Yeah, shinty is a pretty modest affair in Scotland, it's strongest in the western highlands/Argyll/Glasgow, but not that popular outwith those areas
/r/JustBootThings haha
Even in English I'd be surprised if competitive spelling was a thing in countries other than America or Canada
It's not a thing here but we watch enough American telly that everyone knows what it is
The whackest competition shows I can think of are mostly from Japan tbh
They're straight up German words towards the end
*Gesellschaft* is German for Society/Association iirc
Meanwhile, it doesn't really matter much, because the Regions and the Communities go on doing their thing
The aim of these 'soft vetos' is not to stop the Government with a majority in the lower house from doing what it whats
They have a democratic mandate and are accountable to the people
The aim is simply to cause the Government to pause, think, reconsider
It's a way of saying 'Wait, are you sure
Maybe you want to rethink that
If the Government says, 'Yes, we are sure', then they must carry the responsibility for that at the next election
What does the "China: Part 2" mean for Luzern
Is there considerably more Chinese immigrants/investments than other cantons
Is that not Norfolk and Suffolk
Lots of places like that in the UK
Makes sense
I was on exchange at UZH in Zurich for 5 months this year and there always seemed to be vast amounts of Chinese and Indian tourists in the city
The UK is making its way back to this shit again
Well I'm in Scotland so the only other countries that are within driving distance are England & Wales, but I assume that's not what you mean :P
Kidding-aside, it is pretty cool that other countries are just a short flight away
My husband was living in Prague back when we were just dating & I was able to take extended weekend trips to visit him every month so the distance wasn't a huge issue for us
We also went to Bulgaria for a weekend once on a whim, it's awesome to be able to do stuff like that
I really feel for the people who are in a long distance relationship during COVID
Up here in Scotland we've got things a little different from those that on mainland Europe, but it's still pretty amazing
I can hop on a flight and an hour and a half later I can be in Amsterdam or Hamburg
3 hours later I can be in Malaga or Munich or Krakow
Me living on an island: 0\_0
I've never even been to England though so I want to travel a bit if the current situation ever dies down
>Every time I use a mixer tap to wash dishes or quickly wash my hands I have to wait for the hot water to kick in and I end up wasting a lot of water
When I use separate taps I don’t have this issue
You realise the mixing happens inside the tap
The tap itself makes no difference to the delay
Biased opinion from someone who doesn't drink, but I wish we had more of a café culture than a pub culture
Also wish we had more flats with balconies, but seeing as most people here would rather live in houses with their own garden, it makes sense that balconies aren't that big a priority
I want this so bad
Some cities have pay as you go bikes, but then offer no actual lanes on which to use them
A lot of cyclists around where I live frequently cycle on the sidewalk (which is illegal) cause the roads just aren’t safe
Glasgow had a pretty comprehensive tram network once upon a time but the geniuses in the city council completely scrapped it in favour of building two separate motorways that dissect the city
Young people cooking less is a problem that's growing all over the world, it's just growing faster in the UK because of the abundance of ready meals and such
My ex is French - supposedly a country with a strong gastronomic culture - he doesn't know how to cook
First thing I'm going to do when I get my own place is install one of these
Cobbled streets are a pain to drive on, and a literal pain in the arse to cycle on
Old houses and flats have terrible insulation and windows let in so much wind through the edges of the crappy sash single glazed windows - it's very unpleasant
Hard to heat as a result
Mice are a thing that some places just can't get rid of
Typically extremely expensive just by virtue of city centre and lots of places having stuff like period features
Roads being too small honestly isn't really a downside as we need less cars in cities as it is
Unless they’ve replaced the windows it does
And most don’t replace the windows
ABT - anyone but Tories
Vote for whoever is going to keep the tory candidate from winning
In the vast majority of seats that means SNP, though there are a couple where people vote Labour/Lib Dems because they're in a better position
This answer doesn't fit exactly with the question but Scots does seem to be fading away each generation even if it's just word by word
Looking on older generations (from my experience) I hear words that aren't used among younger people anymore like gan for go, ingins for onions and stuff like that, and then looking at the younger generations you notice some aren't using words even their parents are using around them or just reverting to how they hear Americans on tv talk
An example of this would be one time when my niece was going about saying trash can, and my other one goes about saying tomorrow like tomarrow how Americans say it but I'm sure she'll grow out of it
I remember my little cousins dad was on about his jaikit/jeckit, however you wanna spell it (jacket) and his son had absolutely no clue what he was even talking about
Literally even his own name, tyler, he was being told by his friend it wasn't pronounced like "tiyler" and it was "tahyler"
Guising
It's like our equivalent to Trick or Treating, but rather than just turning up at someone's door and expecting/demanding stuff you have to earn it with something like a shite joke, singing a song etc
The traditional thing to say when you're out guising is "Do you want any guisers
" rather than "Trick or Treat". A fairly minor change all things considered but it's a shame to see us going the American way
We also used to carve turnips rather than pumpkins
Granted pumpkins are easier to carve but I hate the smell of them, at least neeps aren't too bad
Same here
It's really rare to find a fluent gàidhlig speaker under 50 who speaks it from birth
Absolutely this
Scots gets more and more Anglicised and also more Glasgow influenced, "wean" is overtaking "bairn" further from Glasgow all the time
I know there’s a lot of schools in Glasgow for Gaelic
Hopefully numbers start to grow again
I guess that's what happens when only 1 standardization gets shoved in your face all the time
Even some poet from fife went about and made a poem on weans instead of bairns
Len Pennie
I think Welsh managed to keep itself afloat because they held bible and church services in the Welsh language, so churches across Wales were able to keep holding services in Welsh
I think so
She's the young one with long ginger hair
She gets a by, she's actually from Glasgow/North Lanark-way, she's just at uni in St Andrews
In Stirling it's mostly just the under 40s who use wean, in Falkirk you even hear it from people well into their 60s. It's a shame, bairn is a far nicer word in my opinion
ohh, I read on a news article that she was meant to be from fife, I guess you can't trust anything now
The locals drive too quickly, and the tourists drive too slowly
Most single track roads in Scotland are well provisioned with passing places, and if two cars meet head on, the one closer is expected to reverse to the nearest passing place
Tourists are encouraged to pull into a passing place if traffic builds up behind them
Blocking a passing place by parking in it is severely frowned upon, but of course, many people still do
Just drive at a fairly normal speed until you get to a corner or blind spot in case there’s a car
If there is a car one of the cars has to reverse until they get to a passing place, then the other car goes ahead
portugal wins
I felt my shoulders closing in on myself just from going through in google maps
Flower of Scotland is the national anthem and Scotland the Brave is a close second but very similar in tone
I’d go for [‘Caledonia’ by Dougie MacLean
] It is essentially a love song to Scotland about being away and feeling like your losing that connection so coming home
Not Irish myself, but surely “Come out ye black and tans” is up there
For us it’s probably 500 miles by the Proclaimers, or Loch Lomond
Auld Lang Syne, Scotland the Brave,Loch Lomond and 500 Miles
Caledonia is a great song, but it's quite miserable for a national anthem
I'd prefer Scotland the Brave since it's so rousing (and can be played on the pipes)
Auld Lang Syne as well surely
Germany has a region called "Ostwestfalen" which translates to eastwestphalia
Sutherland is in the north

I'll make a proper dinner at least four days a week, as for sleep it depends on work
I'm currently working some overtime so I'm not sleeping anywhere near enough but normally I'm not so bad
Yeah I generally have time for all of that
Even with a faster pace of life pre-Covid I still managed to get them in
The ubiquity of kilts is a relatively recent phenomenon in Scots life
For my dad's generation, kilts were generally associated only with soldiers, folk singers and the royal family playing at being highlanders
Even into the 70s, Scotland fans very rarely wore kilts to matches, and weddings and graduation ceremonies were conducted in normal smart clothing
Scotland fans adopted kilts in the early 80s, to distance themselves from violent football subcultures like skins or casuals, and from there kilts have spread and are now widely seen at both informal and formal events in both Highlands and Lowlands
The trick is to put a ball in the middle of that fight, and a goal in the middle of each village
Then you've re-invented medieval 'mob football'.
I absolutely love wearing my kilt
Any excuse
Another one I would add is the tradition of [keeping a traffic cone on the head of the statue of the Duke of Wellington in Glasgow]
[Picture]
We don’t have that many cities but the highlands and islands are a different planet
London
I come from Glasgow, the largest city in Scotland, and even it feels like a small town compared to the UK's capital
Also London has a different accent, way more diversity of cultures, it's far more chaotic and expensive and it's warmer
Not a city, but out of Scotland Stornoway and Lerwick are probably the most foreign feeling for me, just because they're so far away (and Stornoway speaks Gaelic)
Glasgow and Dundee always came across as the most typical of Scotland - Edinburgh has a very historic centre as does Stirling, Perth has a strange layout, Inverness is pretty remote, and Aberdeen doesn't look like any other city in Scotland
The consensus on this thread seems to be that the capital is the most atypical, generally because they have the most foreigners and are the most ‘international’.
This is a bit disappointing as I would imagine most people are more interested in finding out about an unusual place rather than finding out that capital cities are unusual
In my travels through the UK, it’s hard to say for sure but the first one that came to mind was Bristol
I have only travelled through the city by train but it felt different to the rest of the UK because the houses were painted in pastel colours
There is a lot of variation in building materials across the UK and there is a tendency to use local stone, brick or concrete but Bristol is the only place I’ve been here where most of the houses were painted in bright colours like blue, pink and yellow, which I have always associated with sunny foreign countries
I’d love to visit it again
I haven’t been to most of Wales or Northern Ireland though, which I expect feel even more different to Scotland
I don’t know the most typical place in the UK, but for Scotland I would say Falkirk
It’s between Edinburgh and Glasgow but feels like it’s own place, there are a few tourist attractions but it’s otherwise pretty average
Glasgow is the only city that feels like a 'big city' (and even then, not as much as the natives *think* it does), so it feels very different to the rest of Scotland
Visited Lugano as a kid and I thought it felt distinct from Italy
it was very polished, very expensive
it didn’t feel Italian to me
Unfortunately I haven’t had the opportunity to see other parts of Switzerland, so can’t say if it’s truly Swiss
but not Italian
I think Scots should be the linga franca because then I wouldn’t have to be worried about having a few drinks and becoming incomprehensible to anyone not Scottish
It’s one thing speaking the universal language of English it’s another ball game being a little pished and thinking your still speaking it but actually slurring away in your own dialect
Can we just agree it's none of the potato languages
Damn made me laugh out loud got funny looks for it
Can one up you there
Everyone should use Scottish Gaelic; less than 60,000 people can speak it fluently and there's only about 2 million people that speak any closely related language
So essentially have Tolkien write every government document
Can we do it in an exaggerated accent, like in Norsemen
In the interest of fairness the standard Scots should be Shetland Scots so there's that extra Nordic influence
Strč prst skrz krk
not voting for independence 5 years ago is really sucking right now
The whole Panama expedition thing was a terrible idea, terribly executed
Voting no in 2014
The act of union 1707
[The Darien Scheme] is by far our country's biggest mistake and the effects are still very much being felt today
If that hadn't failed the entire world would honestly be completely different since Scots wouldn't have been in the same positions that they were in within the British (likely English in this scenario) Empire
"Alright so let's invest a third of the total money in circulation in the country into a far off colony in a hostile place with relatively little potential for any immediate return on investment already claimed by a much power powerful country, let's do this without any experience in setting up colonies and with every other country we have diplomatic relations with telling us not to, let's also do this when our biggest ally (who kind of rules us but not technically yet) is going to economically blockade us if we do succeed in setting up this colony and our biggest ally is also ramping up for war against our previous biggest ally that we'll definitely be drawn into
&#x200B;
"What do you mean they all died of malaria or got killed by the Spanish and we got nothing back from it creating the largest economic bubble in history
UK: Some would say Brexit, but I'd go a bit deeper than that: failure to re-imagine ourselves as a 'normal European country', and reconstitute ourselves with a modern democratic constitution, after the end of Empire
Brexit is a symptom of that failure
Scotland: Not voting for independence in 2014 when we had a chance
Not dealing with an Indian famine during WWII
not voting for independence
If you just made peace when they said OK and stopped being greedy
Oh carolus
The act of union 1707 wasnae our finest hour either
Yep
I mean, even if it somehow doesn't go through, the last few years have definitely been an ongoing disaster, so definitely an ongoing mistake
Eh a lot of that wasn’t really a mistake
It was clear it was unsustainable and why a lot of it was let go relatively peacefully
[Correct
hahaha aye there's that as well
The country wasn't bankrupt, the merchant class were
The merchant class which formed the majority of the Scots parliament
Which left them susceptible to a bit of bribery when Daniel Defoe came calling

I don't think we deal so much as it's what we're used to lol
The sun sets at about half past four right now, but to be honest I find it more uncomfortable during the summertime when the sun sets at like nine
Moan, a lot
Its a fuckin pain in the fuckin arse
Im about 56°.
We endure it with the knowledge that in six short months we will have amazing long and beautiful days
Swings and roundabouts, basically
You just do
I would hardly call it polar conditions though
Fairly easily
Bit jarring coming back from holiday to the south in the winter, maybe, especially if you had there before it starts getting dark and then return
But it's not much of a bother, and can actually be quite pleasant and serene
Not exactly polar though: in fact, don't even really have much in the way of snows most of the time now
I want to do one winter at 70^o sometime just to see what its all about - im from the highlands of scotland so i think our days are pretty long winter days compared to the far north
Drinking, mostly
Simple, you can’t get depressed if you’re always depressed
At 57° I got to work when it's pitch black and go home when it's pitch black
It can be depressing
I've just realised I live at the same latitude as Moscow
Feels like it too
:-\
Yep
Moan like fuck multiple times a day to whoever's listening, or just stoically agree with the other cunt that's moaning
I fucking hate it
Every year I go into a mild, downtrodden depression that lasts from October to March
If the roads are icy, I can't use the motorbike
If the wife needs the car, I have to take the BUS to work
Which I despise having to do
Anyway, on a brighter note, we're off to Gran Canaria next month
So it's nice to have that to look forward to, which is an answer to OP's question
Somehow, the poor and rainy corner of Britannia that the Romans did not even bother to annex would end up becoming an industrial powerhouse that built half of all metal ships on earth, at the height of the industrial revolution
It feels like a bit of an arse-pull fanservice on the author's part
We kept the Romans out but couldn’t keep the English out
Pull the other one
You went from
>“Paris vaut une messe"
>I refuse to be King unless this piece of cloth is a specific colour
> A common source of pride and ‘Englishness’ is 1066, the battle of Hastings
This is when a French dude came over and became king of England
Is it a source of pride
I always saw it as being taught in a neutral light, or negative one (the Harrying of the North being portrayed as brutal campaign of terror)
Well, "we" technically weren't around for the Roman era
The Scotii were invaders who replaced the Pictish culture
IIRC the Picts spoke a Bretonnic language (like Welsh or Breton), whereas the Scotii were Goidelic speaking (i.e Gaelic)
Celtic (I might be a bit biased) and Olympiacos
- Celtic
- Olympiacos
[think Celtic’s is very nice ] might be biased tho
Also [I really like AEK Athens logo]
I have always liked the Atlético Madrid badge, but I specifically like the [older version]
Also, I am biased but [Hearts]
fucken nessie
Patter
I was thinking just give everyone mild alcoholism
Irish Craic, Scottish patter, sounds like a class night out already
Just need the Scousers and thr Geordies now x
I've lived within sight of the [Wallace Monument] my entire life and never been up
Edinburgh is a very touristy city and I've been to a bunch of the stuff that I'm more interested in like the castles (little known fact Edinburgh castle is not the best castle in Edinburgh) but there's also a bunch of stuff I've never been to and probably never will go to as I've only got a couple months left in Europe
Yep, that would be me
Only heard the story about drunk locals after said event, lovely
I reckon that’s to encourage people to buy Historic Scotland memberships as they pay for themselves very quickly (although that’s obviously no good for a tourist
Craigmillar castle as I referenced is a good start
Obviously, the big museum whatever they call it, the national museum of Scotland I think
A lot of people like the Camera obscura
Dynamic earth and the botanical gardens both often get forgotten but they're both good too
That’s awful
I’m Scottish and 20C *is my absolute functional maximum*. The first time I went to Tenerife it was 22C and I cried like a baby thinking I was going to die and had to be dragged by my mum and auntie across the pavement of lava
Earlier this summer I couldn’t go outside when it was 21C. I managed 10 minutes outside before I had to go have a shower and cower behind the curtains like a vampire
You madman
No, actually
It's basically the surface of Venus
Probably the NHS, growing up I always thought that all countries either had completely private healthcare like America or people went to totally free government run hospitals like we do in the UK where in reality most countries use universal public private partnerships with lots of different ad ons and the NHS is something relatively unique to the UK
&#x200B;
Also having a national costume is apparently something that relatively few other European countries do at least in Western Europe, I find it weird that there isn't a kilt equivalent in France, Belgium or the Netherlands though the more east you go the more you find forms of national dress or forms of formal dress that aren't simply a suit
It was the one downside to what was an otherwise class trip to Austria when I last visited
Never tell a Frenchman what Charlemagne was really called
It’s like that in Greece from my experience
I looked it up a couple of days ago when I stumbled on it while visiting Switzerland, it is also apparently sold in the Netherlands
Tastes quite nice, way better than I expected from a milk whey drink
I'll just add that Scotland's Irn Bru (which is everywhere in Scotland and also mostly available in the rUK) and Malta's Kinnie (which I think might only be stocked in shops in Malta, though you can order it through Amazon UK) are other good national soft drinks
I personally wouldn't mind if Rivella, Irn Bru and Kinnie spread over their borders a bit more, more options away from the Coca Cola company
This used to happen in Northern Ireland quite a lot
If the glass is being recycled rather than reused then plastic is actually better environmentally
The extra resources to melt and shape the glass again as well as the extra weight during transportation makes glass a marginally worse material
The best is glass reuse schemes but they are pretty rare
Here in Scotland our home grown soft-drink producer Barr's (of Irn-Bru fame) used to reuse their bottles with a small deposit but it was barely utilised and costing the company far too much
They ended up stopping it about 5 years ago
I think you can decrease that down to England (and maybe Wales and N.I.)
Cod is rare as fuck in Scotland with Haddock being the default fish
Oh well that's something I didn't know
Was talking with a Dutch acquaintance back in my uni days who said yous didn't.
Do you wear it at weddings
Am British
Live for a decade in France
Learned to make bread seven years ago
Make bread every week
Still go to the Boulanger for bread because French bread is the greatest thing you will ever taste
Silly Serbian person
Finally, we've found one thing where Hungary is not the odd one out
Dude, it's the exact same in Scotland
Yeah, was sure there were more, just haven't visited those countries yet, so was not familiar with them
Still, be better to have them spread about so we all have way more selection and more varied drinks
Plus I really just wanted to talk about Kinnie, cause damn do I love that drink
One of the versions started in the Netherlands if I remember the article, then came to Switzerland a year later
Might have been the low calorie one
I do remember that all the Rivella apart from the Dutch ones are made in Switzerland, while the Dutch use concentrates sent from Switzerland to make theirs, or something
Something odd about it, anyway
We've opened up a bit more about it in recent years
Although it annoys me that an area of Glasgow is branded as the Merchant City, without the city making it clear precisely what (and who
) said merchants were trading
Scotland has autonomy, but England gets upset when we use it
Scotland itself is a devolved nation, but a very centralised one, and moves to devolve more power from Holyrood to the Northern Isles and Western Isles haven't yet gained much traction
Yes but only if we do it in the right way approved by Westminster
Has the power over its own affairs
It’s dragged Scotland out of the EU against its will
Countless Tory Westminster governments even when Scotland had more pandas than Tory MPs
Scotland is getting the short straw
I get the impression our mere existence upsets them sometimes
They're affy sensitive these days
They're not subdivisions
They're countries joined in a union
For now
You can argue almost anything
Right enough
To be honest, I've no wish to impose on Germany - if the people of Germany decide that the mix of Federal-lands, Federal Capital Cities, Free-cities, Free-states and Hanseatic-cities are now countries, I'll happily refer to them as such
Saxony and Bavaria are Free-states, Bremen is a Free-City, Hamburg is a Free- and Hanseatic-city and Berlin is a Federal-capital-City, so not all of them are called countries
The official translation of the *Grundgesetz* uses *Länder
> Those are the names that the Länder gave themselves
Exactly, they don't call themselves countries
> Your point being
That Germany doesn't call them countries, it calls them *Länder* and *Land* doesn't mean country until the German government decides to define it as such and call its component units countries
Your position has changed
It was "we *should* call them countries, now its "we do call them countries".
The official translation of the *Grundgesetz* uses *Land*. Land may well mean country in other contexts, but the official translation of Germany's basic law chooses not to use that context-specific translation, and therefore doesn't refer to it's component parts as countries
The Bundesrat uses "Federal States " in its translation
How it translates is how it's called
If the German government wanted them to be understood as countries, they'd translate it as such
As the UK does
But they don't. So they're evidently happy with the rest of the world not thinking of them as countries
I wish you luck in your campaign changing this - you're clearly passionate about it
> The German government couldn't care less what you call anything
Of course not
But this is about what they themselves call it
> I just think it would be a good idea if we started doing it ourselves
Cool, I hope more folk join your support for the idea
Who knows, one day German officials might agree with you
Good luck
I currently have a pair right next to me, though I use them for embroidery and when using a sewing machine
Haven’t seen them used as medical scissors tho
I'll just join in with the other Scottish person here (hiya) to say we have a decades-old pair in the kitchen drawer here
I've always known Fiskars to be an excellent manufacturer of scissors
We'd have an alliance independent of the UK
I'm pretty sure the English made us
Viva la Auld Alliance
Napoleon was a leader not a despot
You can be I'm charge, and be a despot
You can be I'm charge, and be a leader
The two are not compatible
Your either a despot telling others what to do, or a leader, showing others what to do
I'm currently a language assistant in a bilingual school in Spain, a role which basically would entail being a support teacher to the regular contract staff - in normal times
My job as it is now has me filling the role of full time teacher, for about 60% of my school time
That is to say I'm left alone with classes to work through entire curriculum based textbooks
This is my first year and tbh its hard work trying to fill the role and responsibilities of someone far above what I was brought in to do
I worry about the students, I don't know how effective the administration expects me to be but I fear every day that I'm not doing a good enough job for these kids who already missed so much contact time last year
I'm not given much support in my job either
I find it very hard to motivate them and speak with authority on certain topics as its literally the first time I've seen the resources, and so I'm trying to incorporate extracurricular materials I am familiar with to fill the gaps
This of course makes me worry about if I'm preparing the students well enough for exams, as I don't even know what they'll contain ahead of time
I'm trying to get them motivated, something very difficult these days, but to what end I don't know
This corner cutting by having me fill that role, or filling of staffing gaps as it might be, can only have a detrimental effect to the students
We have *clootie dumplings* in Scotland, although they're a bit different to the Central European ones, as the fruit is mixed through the dough, and not in a pocket in the middle
It sounds similar
Clootie dumplings are boiled to make them soft and dumpling-like
Is Kletznbrot baked or boiled
Edinburgh Castle
Although I might be biased as I’m from Edinburgh, but I can’t think of any other building as iconic
We have a fuck ton - But I might be biased
- Wallace Monument
- Stirling Castle
- Edinburgh Castle
- Armadillo
- Science Tower
The Sagrada Familia also heavily inspired Geonosis in Episode II
From an outside perspective, maybe the church of our lady in Bruges
By rights I should probably be arguing in favour of Stirling Castle instead because I'm biased
However, Eilean Donan castle is probably more what foreigners have in mind when they think of iconic Scottish buildings, it looks far better on a shortbread tin than either Edinburgh or Stirling Castles do in my opinion
I'd have gone with the Forth Bridge
I think the forth rail bridge, the Wallace monument, and the parliament are all decent shouts, but Edinburgh castle is still probably top of the list
From Edinburgh myself but I'd say the Scott Monument
I have a shoebox full of entry certificates somewhere
I think Italy has a bit of an advantage when it comes to iconic buildings
Well yes
However, I was speaking from a Scotland point of view
Elizabeth Tower and Westminster are so iconic they don’t even need to be mentioned
As a foreigner who has visited Norway it's definitely your landscape I think of first
There are plenty of cool buildings out there but they're nothing compared to your fjords and mountains in my opinion
I think it's hard to beat the big fuck-off castle on a rock in terms of distinctiveness in Edinburgh, especially since you can see it from halfway across the city
On the other hand, the Balmoral looks like just about every other building on Princes Street
Edinburgh Castle has elevation and, well, it's a castle and the biggest tourist landmark in Scotland
Put shortly, if you showed 100 people a silhouette of Edinburgh Castle and the Balmoral Hotel, far more people would recognise the castle
I mean yes, standing on the hill nearest to the clock tower will make the clock tower more prominent, but we're talking about Edinburgh as a whole, not the small area closest to the Balmoral
If I'm sitting down at Newhaven, Ocean Terminal is the most obvious landmark, it's obviously not an iconic part of Edinburgh
Old Raleigh road bicycle that rattles, but still gets job done is what I use
Looks a bit like a banger, but mixed with good locks and surrounded by more expensive/fancy bicycles with bad locks, it has survived without incident, which is always a plus
I think most people would commute with road or hybrid bicycles, though in the Highlands I've known a few (and did for a bit myself) use mountain bikes, just by virtue of the cheapest mountain bikes here tended to be cheaper than their road and hy rid counterparts, and the benefit that you could take them to a trail or a mountain downhill path on the weekend
But if you're purely doing road commutes, it'll be a road bike or a hybrid
(Also, I always get co fused by Americans calling it 'biking', that puts motorcycles in mind, 'motorbiking', while pushbikes are 'cycling'.)
1320-1707
That's largely it
Theought the rest of history we've been consistently fighting off outside invasion from either the Anglo-saxons, Vikings, or Romans
* \~498 (Founding of Kingdom of Dál Riata, Kingdom of Alba founded around 843) - 1292 (John Balliol swears allegiance to England)
* 1314 (King Robert 1st establishes de facto independence)- 1651 (Cromwell invades)
* 1660 (End of first union with England) - 1707 (Act of union with England)
&#x200B;
EDIT: Added Dál Riata
1320-1707
763-1296, 1328-1707
Same here
What about old Bohemia
Where do you get the 763 date from
Well not 2020, maybe 2025 but even that's assuming a yes vote in an upcoming referendum which right now seems tenuous
I think we will be independent within my lifetime though
James VI you heretic
James the 1st isn't involved in any of what I said, he's got nothing to do with the independence of otherwise of Scotland
And are you seriously saying that Scotland is occupying England right now
Earliest date of nationhood in terms of Dal Riada
843 is the formation of alba
What do you mean by nationhood though
Dal Riada was founded around 498
Well I'm saying we're no longer independent which y'know, is pretty hard to argue against
Hoi An
Overcrowded, Disneyfied
This is a perfect comment on Athens
Great city
As a former barman (in Scotland), my first thought would be to ID someone who said that
Sounds like a 16-year-old’s first time in a pub
Once that’s sorted, I’d happily oblige
If they wanted the cheapest whisky, though, I’d maybe encourage them to spend a few pence more, because the gap in quality between something like Claymore and something like Black Bottle is far more than the gap in price
I don’t think they would bat an eye here in Scotland, but we are known for being stingy
We did a bit on the Romans and Celts, focussing more on the Romans, in primary school despite not living in a place with any real Roman presence
I was at school from the mid-'90s to mid/late '00s. We've always had a separate education system though
I think primary teachers get quite a bit of freedom with what they teach, I suppose Romans are easy to find information on and pretty interesting as well
We say haich too, we even have Gary Haich a popular Scottish export:
Turkey and Cyprus
Too hot for my pale wee gaìdhlig body to deal with
No not really, there are a few countries I have very little interest in visiting but the only countries I genuinely would never consider visiting would be places where my visiting there would potentially aggravate even to a small degree existing human rights problems, with the possible exception of Belarus (which I have visited) there aren't really any of those countries in Europe
I'll take your word for it
I mean, I sort of get it, Ireland is sort of one of the places I'm less enthused to go to
I would be up fot a jaunt over there, but I'm perhaps a bit more wary, especially as friends with family there have said it can be a pain to get about if you can't drive, which is a problem if you're more interested on visiting places outside of capitals, like myself
Yeah probably gonna give Greece a miss too tbh
Probably
I hesitate to say yes as I haven't visited either part of the island, so I can hardly make a definitive statement
I think to a degree it's the presumption of that and also the fact you can't take a train there, as I have with Wales and England, so once you get to that point where you are flying, you also sort of want to go farther afield
That said, I wouldn't mind going there, just nothing really drawing me and as I said, I've been told it gets a bit more difficult on public transport once you leave Dublin, especially the West
Timbuktu is what springs to mind
Not as interesting as any of the others here, but I grew up on a remote island where almost everyone works fishing, in a fishery, or crofting
The livelihood is essentially kept alive by a healthy mix of the military and tourism, so every summer our single track roads are always filled with camper vans and tourist coaches
So one day, me and my mate were our local shop getting our dinner before going off to Cadets and the shop was absolutely packed with all of these American pensioner types
This is important for later, that the shop is called locally as Nellie's Shop because the last owner was a man named Neil MacLellan, and now his son Ronald runs it
However the name on the front of the shop is MacLellan's Supermarket
One group stuck out like a sore thumb as they were circling Ronald with these absolutely adoring faces, like he was their hero or something, and all me and my mate could hear was one of them ask him; "are you the real life MacLellan
". The two of us could not stop laughing from the other end of the shop at such an absurd question, and we found out later that they thought MacLellan wasn't a real surname and that Ronald was some movie star they had seen back in the States in some classic American movie that romanticised Scotland (haven't been able to figure out which movie it is yet)
Not according to these folks
No didn't see or hear anything about it
I mean other than perhaps Macau there isn't a lot of serious competition is there
We have four police forces in Scotland:
- Police Scotland, the national civilian police, who cover both urban and rural areas alike
- British Transport Police - the civilian railway and ports police (airports are policed by Police Scotland)
- Civil Nuclear Constabulary - who protect nuclear power stations
- Ministry of Defence Police - civilian police who police the environs of the nuclear submarine base at Faslane
The only Military Police here are the Royal Military Police, the Royal Navy Police/Regulators and the RAF Police
These are only responsible for policing on military installations and mostly for making sure service members behave, and have *no* responsibility or powers over civilians outside of military bases
There is no Gendarmerie/Carabinieri equivalent here
My area has 6 police forces
Police Scotland which is just the standard police force for civilian uses
Ministry of Defence police that protect the big military base in the area
Civil nuclear constabulary which protects the place where warheads are stored
Royal Military police which police the army and just arrest soldiers that got to drunk while out in the towns and the Royal Navy Police who do the same thing for sailors
And we also have the British Transport Police who are at train stations and go on the trains on the weekend and stuff like that to prevent crimes for happening
Only police Scotland arrest civilians with the other forces only detaining people before giving them over to the normal police to deal with
Same
Three bobbies stretched over a pretty large peninsula here
Still Police Scotland, not some miltary group
It didn't really make a difference
Initially, policing got worse, as there was a feeling that the new national force introduced aggressive urban policing into rural areas where that was unnecessary
There was also an issue where the Glasgow Chief Constable - who had a very puritan worldview - enforced aggressive policing of the sex trade in Edinburgh, where previously they'd taken a more "observe and protect" *laissez-faire* policy
Things calmed down eventually, and some savings were made from having a single national administrative function
The crime rate in Glasgow has improved, but that's more to do with the police and health services agreeing to treat knife crime as both a crime issue and a public health problem
Glasgow has a gang problem; Foggieloan does not
The two places need different policing techniques to solve different problems
By skipping most of it
I'm a history buff but even I have a lot of periods of Scottish history I really don't know much about
There's just too much, we're one of the oldest countries in Europe and there's just been a bunch of complex stuff going on
We did the Scottish Wars of Indpenance for 3 years, and the Darrien Scheme up until the Highland Uprisings for one year
The rest was WW2
Here you can leave after:
Fourth year - 15/16 - you won't be going to uni unless you go to college and get an HNC/HND
Fifth year - 16/17 - some people go to uni after this year
Sixth year - 17/18 - most people that go to uni will leave after this year
It can be 17 or 18, depending on the courses you choose in school, and which course you choose at university
Students can leave secondary school after 5th year with Higher qualifications at 17, or stay on for an extra year to sit Advanced Higher qualifications
Some university courses will accept entrants with Highers, others require Advance Highers
The way the school enrolment system works in Scotland, some people can be 17 when the leave high school after completing all six years of secondary school and still be 17 by the time they start university
For most people who are going straight from school to university they will be 18 though
You can go to university at any age technically in Scotland
However most people are 17/18
However it is possible to go at 16
That's kind of wild, I'll graduate just after I turn 21
By the sounds of things it's actually kind of similar in France and Scotland
The way the enrolment system works in Scotland is from 1st of March until the 28th of February
For talking's sake, let's use an example of kids born between March 1994 and February 1995
They were scheduled to start primary school in the August of 1999
The kids born between March 1994 and August 1994 would have been 5 by the time they started school and the kids born between September 1994 and February 1995 would have been 4
The school year finishes in late June in Scotland
So those kids born between March 1994 and February 1995 would have completed 13 years at school (7 years primary school, 6 years secondary school) in June 2012
The kids born between March and June 1994 would leave school aged 18 and the kids born between July 1994 and February 1995 would leave school aged 17
Norway has three land borders, two of which are with neutral countries, the other with the successor state to the country NATO was founded in opposition to
In Scotland there’s been a sense of solidarity with Catalonia from some of us who support Scottish independence
Clara Ponsati fled here following the ‘unofficial’ referendum
Here’s a recent BBC article regarding her extradition
I think Madrid has been trying to charge numerous other Catalonian politicians with treason
In my opinion it’s awful and Catalonia should be allowed an official referendum on their independence like Scotland was
Yes, I know and as a Hungarian I should imagine you’re well placed to say that
However, the right to self determination is what really matters
Very interesting response, thanks
I’d assumed (perhaps wrongly) that the Catalan nationalists and SNP were comparable but perhaps not
You’re right, the SNP are a progressive socially democratic movement focused on being pro-Scottish rather than anti-English
Evidenced in the fact that I was born and initially raised in England before moving to Scotland as a teen and am staunch SNP voter these days
However, I must agree with the German poster who rightly stated, it is easier to be a democratic movement when you’re allowed a referendum
Madrid made a big mistake there and internationally we looked on with shock
I’ve never heard anyone propose that
Doesn’t sound like a nice idea to me
There are always winners and losers in democratic votes, that’s simply the nature of democracy
There’s little militancy to the movement in Scotland and I doubt it would progress to it but I suppose it’s an unknown scenario
Unlike Spain we don’t have a formalised written constitution, nor one banning the freedoms yours appears to
It’s based on having a mandate for a referendum and the SNP continue to be the largest party in Scotland, both via Holyrood and Westminster supporting that mandate
You quote these polls as if it strengthens your argument when actually it shows they are very close and there is massive support for independence in the region
Just because other countries have similar laws doesn’t make it right
If you’re so sure of a pro-Spanish victory then have a referendum ffs
Apparently the freedom to hold a referendum
I don’t need to
Im not too sure but I found this on Google about the area of "Stirling"
**"Stirling derives from Gaelic srib-linn, meaning "stream-pool"**
I grew up in a town that's name derives from old Scots phrase for "hidden town" as the town sits in a sudden valley compared to its surrounding which is gentle rolling hills
It's has saved the town from being sacked a few times in the middle ages when the English marched right past it without noticing it was there on their way to Edinburgh
Edinburgh
Edin comes from Eidyn, the name of the place in Cumbric, the Brittonic (Celtic, but not Gaelic) language that was spoken by the Picts before the Scotti (Gaelic, not Brittonnic) took over
The name's meaning is unknown apparently
Burgh is Germanic and comes from Scots and Anglo-Saxon, it means the same thing as it does in English or German and so on (Town or Fortress)
The real reason why they picked Baile Átha Cliath as its Irish name, instead of Dubh Linn, is because nobody wants to be associated with the Blackpool in England
Even if it's in another language, sharing names is embarrassing enough
Imagine being Snot
You could have had a cool Anglo-Saxon name like *Chad*, but instead your parents named you fucking Snot
Hello, I’m currently living in that town
Huh, I always presumed it was because it was on the sea, hence bord eaux
Hi, It was good place to grow up, but I left there more than a decade ago now
It was a little too small and quiet for me
How do like living there
I was just joking about the fact that Blackpool is generally considered to be a bit of a dump by most people in the UK lmao
Strath Clyde, Glasgow, Herriot Watt, St Andrews, Stirling, Dundee
Edinburgh, St
Andrew’s and Glasgow
I always assumed it was to do with the nobility being the law of their own lands, they were always on country estates with witnesses present so it would make sense to  gather them together and make the accusation Infront of the top dog
Most Scots will switch to standard English (albeit with an accent) when speaking to a foreigner or indeed an English person
RP's an accent, not a dialect
Most Britons will moderate their dialect for people if they are struggling to keep up, but they aren't going to put on a fake accent
Standard English will get used or something approximating that
> asking a person from Manchester to speak RP is unthinkable
RP is as much an accent as it is a dialect
A person from Manchester wouldn't necessarily be expected to adopt an entirely new accent, but they would be expected to use a standardised dialect in place of Mancunian, if talking to someone not from the area
I love that about Norway
Even though the law is there to protect dialects is there still a level of prejudice associated with particular dialects or are people generally quite accepting
I was wondering what you meant with the "R" in bath thing until I figured (from my point of view) it would sound more like "bawth" in your accent I believe
As you can imagine, throwing an R in it with my accent would really stick out
>In the US, I've had to put on an American accent when pronouncing 'water' to make myself better understood
Wawdoor
I tend to get on fine with Americans understanding water in my own accent as long as I enunciate the Ts properly
Absolutely no chance with curtains though, that's the one word I've found that Americans can't understand me saying no matter what
Does someone ever talk like that in real life
I always thought it was a weird accent that only BBC presenters and kids in posh boarding schools were made to talk
Aye, curtains is a bit of a niche conversational topic, I'm surprised it's come up at all to be honest
My Irish pal had to translate, they could understand his accent no bother when he said it
I was going to write something like plug types or which side of the road you drive on
And then I realised its literally only really the UK that's different
I wish we were the same as the rest of our continent because I've only ever driven on the left side and I am genuinely shitting myself for the future if I ever have to drive on the right
That's what I was thinking haha
Huh
Well I suppose Switzerland just have to be the odd one out all the time haha
They're not in the EU anyways so it's not really important for them to be the same
Yeah I thought the third one was neutral and the EU 2 holed one was like without any neutral and made it dangerous but apparently they still have a neutral somewhere so idk
As far as I know there's no dumplings in Scotland as per the definition
However we do have a dessert called a Clootie Dumpling
In the West coast of Scotland we have salt and vinegar with our chips, in the east they have salt and sauce, some sort of demonic invention of the eastern heretics
Hating labour for being too Tory like, or hating Tories for being too labour like
Also milk first or cereal first
People are going to say tea first, or boiling some milk, wavering a tea bag in the next room, and calling it too strong to drink
Salted porridge vs
non-salted porridge
"Saat an saas" or "salt and vinegar".
Edinburgh people eat chips with salt and a vinegary brown sauce, the rest of the country eats them with salt and vinegar
I have no dog in the fight, as I prefer chips with just salt
Aberdeen also has the interminable conflict over where the best fish suppers are to be had
The war will never end, as the quality of various chippers waxes and wanes
I used to be a devotee of The Bluebird and The Ashvale, but have to admit that Hass' has overtaken both now
Everyone agrees that the Hilton Fish Bar is gaads though
Its a silly one, it all depends on context
If you're making it in a pot with leaves, it makes sense to pour the milk first so you don't have to do some kind of guessing game with the tea strainer
If you're doing it in a mug, literally no one puts milk in first - the teabag becomes soggy and just eugh weird
Tea in first when making tea
Milk in first when making coffee
What flavour is it
Brown
This is it
I'm on the "è fimmina" side
("It's a she/female/woman", a saying in Palermo)
Oh hell yeah
Sorry, what I mean is:
Coffee, milk, water
For the instant coffee most people would be drinking at home or in the office
Listen, we're busy fighting ON the island about this very important thing without someone putting also the mainland in the mix
Ah yes glorious Af-slut-dick my favourite
is it for actual graves that are going to be used
France
They won the geographic lottery in Europe
Coast on the Atlantic and Mediterranean, Alpine mountains, Pyrenees mountains, and I just love the culture and history
I respect them for their achievements in art, sciences, war, music, and philosophy
I wish Charles de Gaulle had been born a Briton so he could have been our Prime Minister tbh
Ha ha, for me this country is too much like a postcard
I want to go somewhere that has forests and cool wildlife, with lots of different types of scenery
A Norwegian loves our nature
Huh, I thought we were just the discount version of your landscapes lol
Well, my family comes from the part of Scotland that used to belong to you lot, but you gave it away in a wedding dowry
But you’re from *Norway*. That’s a beautiful country if ever there was one
High praise considering what Norway is like
I was out paddling on a loch today with a half Norwegian friend who mentioned that where we were reminded her of the bit or Norway her mum is from
Admittedly that's probably helped with all the non-native trees planted by the Forestry Commission on the hills around us
I've only been in and around Oslo so I haven't seen "real" Norway if you know what I mean
The loch I was in today is about 145-150m deep at the deepest bit, plenty of space for a monster
Edit: I’m a fanny, 145-150’, not metres, so only like 45m!
Taky se učím češtinu a rozumím.
Not really, no
We're not used to it, and we've also got that Northern European thing where being openly pleased and proud is frowned upon
I think Norway's scenery is like Scotland's without the baby proofing
Almost as if you were to take the rubber protective caps off of the mountains
>we've also got that Northern European thing where being openly pleased and proud is frowned upon
really depends where you are I guess, some people can be too much of that
We're like step-Nordic or something
Nordic-lite
That honestly sounds pretty different from most Spanish folk I've met
Im a proud European but a passport that says "Republic of Scotland" is the dream
Nothing wrong with the queen
It's her government I dislike
Alba gu bràith
Fuck knows bud
Sorry gents but its no jist escaping the tories we're worried about
More than welcome to visit though :)
We did
You voted in parties that copied America and ruined it
Nothing against Elizabeth Windsor personally
Its monarchy I dislike
And her government
And tories in general
Good luck gents

It's from the Latin *cuniculus -* which means a rabbit, rabbit burrow or burrow more generally
(More accurately it's from the Ancient Greek *κόνικλος* ( pronounced kóniklos), which is where the Latin term comes from
) Quite a few European languages have words for rabbit derived from this root
Irish has coinín, Dutch Konijn, Italian coniglio, Spanish conejo and English has coney
Who is your country's most disgraced politician
In honour of former Scottish first minister Alex Salmond being tried for 14 cases of sexual misconduct including 2 cases of rape with another 25 or so unproved allegations who is your country's most disgraced politician
Pretty much every First Minister we've had other than Sturgeon and Dewar (RIP) tbh to varying degrees of disgrace
Going back a little bit for that eh
I think they blame that one on Austria
Who's the 1%?
That sounds like one of those poorly worded religious diversity classes we had to take in primary school
His trial date was announced today
He was arrested and charged in January
Unless there's something I don't know about him Varadkar seems pretty decent
Maybe that's in comparison to our overlord being a bumble bee on meth though
What did McConnel do that was so bad other than that affair
Don't remember him that well though
There aren't many people that like him
He wasn't in favour of democracy at all, set himself up as the lord protector and his son inherited the title after him
He was mostly about enforcing a radical (for the time) religious agenda
Jeffery Archer helped fund an African coup attempt perpetrated by a friend of his and went to prison for perjury and perverting the course of justice all while remaining (to this day) a sitting member of the house of lords
> This may be Ireland specific but I could not buy cough medicine over the counter which was a very unhappy surprise the first time I got sick and wanted some NyQuil
That may be Ireland specific
I can get cough medicine no bother over the counter in Scotland
Very good and comprehensive answer
Present problems in the south have deep historical roots which were briefly shoved under the carpet from the 80s up until the 08 crisis hit, all thanks to cheap credit which fueled growth booms in all of those countries, growth that didn't result in the creation of wealth-producing industries in most cases due to the nature of the modern day global market, simply put they had zero chance of being able to compete with the already established industrial giants, and industry could (still can) be always outsourced to places with cheaper labour
When credit became scarce those structural problems resurfaced revealing the size of the phantom economy cheap credit had created over the decades, while also having completely obliterated what little industrial wealth-producing assets those countries had in the first place
It's the perfect combination of history, bad policies and the influx of cheap credit that resulted in this current situation
What is needed to solve this is a healthy dose of foreign investment from the EU and a fair amount of regulations (or protectionism) to help create nascent, sustainable industries
The only other option would be for the EU to federalise and implement internal transfers like in the USA, covering for the deficits of those states, essentially turning them into sources of human capital for the industrial north and warm holiday places for northern pensioners to retire to
Yep, the near future, as things stand, doesn't look good
Unless some direct action is taken by a more consolidated EU, with some serious leadership and creative problem solving, it's anyone's guess how things will look 10 years from now
EU is in DIRE need of reform yesterday
It's not just the future of the EU as a political project that's at stake if nothing changes but the fate of its member states themselves

Trump claimed knife crime was so bad that "his friend" told him hospitals were as bad as in a warzone and corridors are awash with blood
He also said there's areas of Birmingham that are no go areas for non Muslims
Utter fabrication
The only kernel of truth in that massive dump of a lie is that the UK is currently seeing a rise in knife crime and there are Muslim community's in Birmingham
Everything else is utter fabrication

Jeremy Hunt recently announced to a Japanese trade delegation that his wife was Japanese - which would have been news to her, as she's Chinese, so I wouldn't expect too much in the way if accuracy from him
I honestly have no idea how he gets away with it
He constantly lies and when he's presented with facts and statistics he has the audacity to scream 'fake news'.
I remember when he got in he was asked about how he felt that that Clinton actually got more of the popular vote than he did
"No she didn't."
Confused looking reporter: "She did
You won the election but Hillary had more votes from the public
"No
More recently: "TOTAL EXONERATION
The Mueller Repprt explicitly states: "While this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him
It's infuriating
Former international development secretary Priti Patel suggesting the UK should threaten to cut off Ireland's food supplies as a Brexit negotiation tactic
Aside from being needlessly aggressive and grossly offensive, it was also utterly pointless, as Ireland is one of the most food secure nations in the world (I wonder why that might be a priority in Ireland
nothing to do with earlier British policy, surely
>These are the same people that claimed Obamacare included "death panels" where doctors decided whether or not you'd be allowed to live or instantly killed

*Rain is only skin deep*
Usually I just hear it to mean as: "Rain isnt that bad, it only gets to your skin"
But once or twice I've heard it used to say "Bad times can only be so bad"
Or *Lang may yer lums reek*
Which is like, I hope your chimney smells for a long time cause that means your home with the fire on which means your warm and all that
Pòg mo thòin - kiss my arse
Awa' and bile yer heid - away and boil your head - usually said when someone says something ludicrous, absurd or stupid
Can also be used in place of get lost, or, well, fuck off
Ah cannae dae it: I can’t do it
Yell get a skelp roond the lug: you’ll get a smack around the ear
Yer aff yer heid: you’re off your head (basically, you’re crazy)
Ah dinnae ken/ Ah dae ken: I don’t know
Some words are:
Canny: pronounced the same as cannae (can-A) means careful
Cannae: I cant
Bonnie: beautiful
Auld: Old
Clipe: another word for snitch (so if someone is a clipe then they are a snitch)
Eejit: idiot (pronounced egit)
Tattie: Potato
Neeps: Turnips
I'm proud as well and I'm not even Dutch
I mean, I speak Scots if that counts
But it only works in the Scottish Lowlands
About 15 years ago I travelled around parts of Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania - and in many places I found that German was a much more useful intermediary language than English

I cans agree on the drunk part but don't understand where the cheap has came from
Can't wait to hear the jokes though
Aye I thought that's were the joke was going
22 during the day, 17 at night
i'd say it gets cold at 20 (day)
Genuinely like if it’s 19 outside I’ll be in short and a T-shirt, if it’s 19 inside I’m shivering, it’s so weird
Until I was assaulted in a well-lit outdoor shopping centre last week at 21:00, I generally thought it was very much
A week later wincing around the house with cracked ribs I’m not sure my opinion is so valid anymore
Generally it’s quite fine in the city centre but you always seem to get the radges coming out of the woodwork wherever you go
Do bear in mind that 3 years of regular night walks, this was the first violent incident I experienced though it’s a daily struggle trying to get the addict beggars to leave you alone when they’re begging for cigarettes or telling the most stupid elaborate stories trying to get money off you
Stirling
Most of the town is fine most of the time
There are a few of the schemes and nearby villages that can be a bit of a no-go area but I'm probably safer than most; I'm a reasonably big guy with a reasonably big dog, but not so big that some wee dicks would see that as a challenge
There's a wee bit of the "fuck outsiders" mentality from some in the old pit villages
There are some places I wouldn't want my partner going though, even with the dog
The town centre on a Friday/Saturday night (pre-pandemic) is actually one of the safer places as it's usually packed with police
I'm in Stirling and although we have our fair share of junkies it's a pretty safe area
They won't try to rob you of valuables, but might ask you if you have a spare cigarette, they'll leave you alone when you say no
Which city in Scotland
Depends on who you are and where you are, a 14 year old emo in Hillpark won't be left alone
It could be any
Some of them are so insular it’s unbelievable
My dad was working in Valleyfield, so very much west Fife, not even remote
A guy whose house he was working in couldn’t believe he’d travelled “all the way from Stirling”. My dad asked him “how far away do you think Stirling actually is
”  The guy was convinced it was about a three hour drive away
Hillpark doesn't seem to be as bad as it used to be in that regard, but maybe I'm not enough to attract their attention
Used to be really rough when I was younger, my friend lives on Queen Street and thinks its quietened down big time
I'm not sure if it's calmed down over the years or I'm just too old for it to be as much of an issue nowadays
I've got some family in Hillpark, I'm a bit further out now
Depends how big you are
We have a the bagpipes, no one really knows if it's played really well or really bad
Our City was formerly the capital, home to our ruling dynasty even after that
We have the countries biggest castle and 2 major battlefields are within sight of the walls so it gives plenty to choose from
If I had to pick a definitive one it would be the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314, where Robert I defeated a much larger English army
Yeah, I read an English translation one from 2006
Maybe they just owned the German language version
The phrase you are looking for is 'False Friends' and obviously there is a subreddit
Watch [this helpful instructional video] and do the opposite
Then watch [this helpful instructional video] and do what it says
It's a bit dated, and a bit England-specific, but it will give you a good start on what to do and not do
Definitely this
Its really annoying when people don't do this
As a Brit, they probably just appreciated that you weren't wearing a football top with a sovereign ring and tribal tattoos, while trying to start a fight
I think you mean more the young neds that go down for their 'lads holidays'. That's not just an English thing the whole UK is guilty for that
Thank you :-)
I think Greek punctuality is the problem here, not American impatience
If you agree upon a time, show up at that time
As you say probably a cultural thing but I would find that annoying
Or worse, just the UK
I've had conversations on here where Americans go on about 'Europe' but it's clear they're only talking about the UK (or even just England/London)
We are so racially homogeneous that universal healthcare is easy (despite the too things being completely unrelated) while being overrun with Muslims at the same time
I wonder what Umberto eco would think of it
A house with 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms and 2 living rooms for the lowest offer of £290,000
For about €400k you'd get a bigger 4 bedroom house in a nice area, possibly with a double garage or maybe an older house with some half decent architectural merit
House prices are slightly higher than the Scottish average here, but nowhere near the most expensive
For my area that is the most expensive house I can find
I am not even far from Edinburgh
Loch Ness
It may be the biggest loch by surface volume and have its resident dinosaur but in all honesty there's literally thousands of prettier views in the Scottish Highlands
If you have kids, then fair enough
They'll probably enjoy buying some tacky plastic models of Nessie
But if you don't, rent a car and  go find some beautiful, empty spot in the far west or north that you can call your own
I remember going with an ex-girlfriend to a restaurant in Prague
Both of us were foreign but had lived in Prague for several years
We went into a restaurant near the centre and ordered a meal, and asked for tap water
The waiter told us that the tap water in Prague wasn’t good and suggested that we order something off the menu instead
We told him we would do without, and after giving them some time to start cooking, we got up and left
When the waiter came after us, we told him we were locals and knew the water was fine
The funny thing is, if he had just kept his mouth shut we would have ordered other drinks later on
Fuck restaurants that try to take advantage of their guests
Royal Mile looks cool, especially at dawn
Just don't buy anything
> The Montjuïc Castle has some very nice views and you can get there either via funicular (better) or Cable car (expensive as hell)
We made the mistake of walking
Which ordinarily wouldn't be that big of a deal except my friend had a broken leg so I ended up having to carry her most of the way
Fuckall
Maybe some animals but fuck knows
We call it pish the bed in Scots too
Whats the dutch for hippo
Stop teasing us lol
Mind stop laughing long enough to eat

maybe TV although I heard he nicked the idea
Penicillin, pneumatic tire, macadamised roads, pedal bike, print stereotyping, roller printing, adhesive postage stamp, ATM’s and PIN numbers , saline drop, hypodermic syringe, beta blockers, logarithm’s and maxwells equations for electromagnetism to name a few

Penicillin,
MRI Scanners,
Refrigerators,
Daily Disposables Contacts Lenses,
ATM Machine's,
Colour Photography,
Flushing toilets,

The steam engine
[scottish inventions]
It’s probably faster if I just link to the Wikipedia page for scottish inventions
Oy yea, bagpipes
Penicillin was invented by a Scot along with Adam Smith being the father of capitalism and James Watt basically being the person who kick started the industrial revolution
Scottish writers also invented, Sherlock Holmes and James Bond
The first ever cloned mammal was in Scotland named dolly the sheep a thing I’m extra proud of as my grandmother helped look after dolly as she worked as a administrator at the company at the time
And how could we forget the refrigerator and flushable toilet two things we couldn’t live without
And one of the most famous Scottish Exports would be Rockstars Grand Theft Auto, and on the topic of rockstar the Pinkerton Detective agency in red dead redemption was founded by a Scotsman
Your country invented the FN FAL the firearm of the free world
>The telephone (screw you Bell, it was our guy alright)
As a Scot I am more than happy to give you guys credit for this
Bell was a grade A cunt of the highest order
A morally bankrupt thief and trickster
In fact we're all pretty happy he moved to the states so we don't have to take "credit" for him
There is a village in Perthshire called Dull
Dull,
It's literally called Dull
I think the village of Lost In Aberdeenshire tops the cake or maybe Shittington
The western isles, the northern isles (they normally go by other better names tbf)
The Highlands and the Lowlands
And of course Clackmananshire
There's a town called dull in Perth and Kinross
Hey, just as an aside, me and a few friends will be going to Dusseldorf in about 6/7 weeks
Can you recommend any good bars to drink in
I've been to Fatty's Irish pub (the Guinness is good there btw) and a couple of pubs on Bolkerstraße, but just looking for some more places that someone who lives there would recommend
And Bland NSW
I can see those yellow vests being a lot more numerous, for sure
I cannot imagine people being okay with potentially entire platforms simply pulling out of Europe entirely
I would laugh at the prospects of the next election but it's clear that Axel and his Government of Who Gives a Fuck are all too rich already to care about their jobs
The EU have officially overstepped their boundaries
The beginning of the end for them is here
The allies won WWII, but Germany won the peace following; the Fourth Reich is real, and it's one step closer to establishing the authoritarian, corrupt, Republic Senate that it has always wanted
I have completely U-Turned on Brexit because of this issue; not the singular issue, of course, that would be misguided as for now, it seems that the benefits outweigh the costs; but the principal that these old men and woman can decide things that will affect all countries under, what should be, a trade union but now seems more like the USSR
I expect, and fully welcome, riots
That’s pretty much their MO
Nigel Farage constantly goes on about the EU doing nothing, wasting money, etc
The man never showed up for votes, neglected his duties as the UKs representative on committees , and only appeared when he needed to generate the latest soundbite for his followers
> So basically they would create the problem and then use it as a strawman
Yes
Look at Nigel Farage's EU attendance record, and then look at how he complains about people in the EU not doing their job
Because like you say, they don’t have the name recognition; I can’t actually think of my local MEP off the top of my head, while I know my MP & MSP
Nigel, meanwhile, is infamous for not bothering to do his job
It depends what you think their job is
If their job is to antagonise Brussels and get us out of the EU then they’re doing brilliantly
If you think their job is to represent us within the structure of the EU and get the best deal for us then I don’t think they are doing that
Compare to the SNP in Westminster - they don’t want to be there, they want to leave, but they still operate within the system and try to get the best for Scotland within the UK, rather than merely be antagonistic
And they definitely don’t (IMO) treasonously call for a foreign government to subvert the will of parliament because he doesn’t agree with them
We have this thing where we deep fry a whole pizza, it’s so good
Yes, but mainly for dipping the crusts into, rather than as an extra topping
> It's nothing special on top: sausage, mushrooms, cheese, bacon
The one thing quite different was that instead of tomato sauce it had garlic sauce on the bottom
That sounds similar to the French/German *Flammküchen*.
Yes
Ah, oops
Thanks for putting me right
Pros: easy access to the great outdoors

*laughs in Scottish*
Dutch food was stuck in the 'British food in the 1950s' zone for a long time: national dish is basically sausage with mash-and-cabbage; most other dishes are either terrifyingly bland and tasteless, or deep fried
But now Dutch food is in the 'British food in the 1970s' phase
An excess of low-grade ingredients thrown together without any thought as to taste, finesse or balance
So you'll find things like a burger in a brioche (why
) with salmon, avocado, honey mustard dressing, olives and rocket - as if just piling on different tastes made it better
It's like the whole country is colourblind or tone-deaf, but for taste
As a Scotsman currently living in the Netherlands, I have to say that just about everything else in the country is great
It's just the food culture that's so woefully terrible
Con: The tories are fucking us over too
For Russia: I'm far from being a Communist, but "the Red Army is the Strongest" is such a great song
I also enjoy Farewell to Slavianka and Let's Go
I love 'Hatikvah' (the Israeli national anthem)
It's just such a stirring tune
> I really like "I vow to thee, my country",
Gustav Holst really makes everything better

Hadn't thought of American Civil War songs, but now that you mention it, the Battle Hymn of the Republic is also fantastic imo
Nothing beats the line "As He died to make men holy, let us die to make men free
[Virginia's Bloody Soil is a more somber one, but also very good, especially with Tenesse Ernie Ford's voice] The last stanza always gets me

>He died to save our Union; he's free from care and toil
>Thank God the Stars and Stripes still wave, above Virginia's soil
Aye you can
Would get a slap from somecunt putting they tunes on
Worst part is that God save the Queen isn't even from the UK lol, the tune and melody are originally French iirc
If it's any consolation, it's really got nothing to do with that kind of slavery
It's a Whig song about civil liberty
It means not being under arbitrary or tyrannical rule
Poor bastard is perpetually on the YouTube deathbed because of his commentators lol
From Glasgow so it’s a bit divided haha
Obviously there will be houses that play they tunes but they wouldn’t put them on at a party if it was mixed company
Sure it was a dick move, but given how chaotic Rhodesia turned out, it kind of saved them from a shitty long term investment
Shame as liked Liverpool as a city before as well haha
Obviously you habe things like the great fire of london but in terms of somewhat recent years Id be more inclined to say something along the lines of grenfell, the hilsborough disaster, and the 7/7 bombings
May all the victims rest in paradise
From Dundee, Scotland the Tay rail bridge disaster
Happened in December of 1879 where during a storm the bridge fell down into the ice cold water
No one on board survived
Easily the most serious disaster in Dundee's history

It was but it set sail from Southampton
So I guess both could claim it if they really want to
HAGGIS
Mostly everyone herehas haggis threw out the year useally on Burns Night or At
Andrews Day
It's not eaten everyday despite some stereotypes that might say that
Easy answer for Scotland
Haggis
Most people have either never had it or don't like it, and those who do like it (such as myself) only eat it maybe 3 or 4 times a year
Burn's Night, St Andrew's Day, and maybe a couple times when you order a fry up and they give haggis instead of black pudding
haggis isn't *never* eaten here but it's a lot less common than what people might think
I already thought people realised that we don't go about eating haggis every day and anyone saying so was just saying it for a joke, but I heard some guy say that haggis is our *staple* food in scotland which it isn't even close to
There is a trdelník place outside Rajská Zahrada metro station in Prague
Only trdelník place I’ve seen outside the centre
Isn’t french onion soup an American dish, only called “french” because of how the onions are chopped
Not every day but definitely a couple of times a week for some people, maybe it depends on your working environment
Working in heavy industry it's sometimes my job to go on the roll run and there are always a couple of folk who want haggis
I have once a week at least
That's what I'm having for my dinner tonight
Well, lobsters might end up getting a lot cheaper now that the creel fishermen are struggling to export to Europe
A full fry-up is a 'once a week' thing, really
Afternoon tea vouchers are a go-to birthday present for mams and grans though
Try Stornoway black pudding next time
Far better than ordinary black pudding, it'll blow your mind
My father used to make a starter salad from Stornoway black pudding, celery and grilled apple on shredded cos lettuce
Fun fact (you don't need to know this) people in Inverclyde call "square sausage",  slice
"Would you like a slice and tattie scone roll
Even worse, I knew one guy from Falkirk that called it "flat sausage".
The Lancashire black pudding has too many fat lumps in it for my taste
Much prefer the Stornoway one
World's highest rate of recorded assaults

Since this has blown up and there are a few people saying they might not come to Scotland as a result I want to clarify a few things
&#x200B;
* As a tourist you're in virtually no danger
* We're not actually higher in rate than places like South Africa and Honduras we just record it better, we're probably higher than anywhere else in western Europe
* Scotland isn't a warzone and things are improving even since those statistics I posted bellow (still number one though)
* Scotland isn't any higher in other crimes than neighbouring countries, we still have the typical low European murder rates and similar stuff
Most assaults are more drunken punching and kicking with relatively minimal injuries
Being governed from Westminster by people who don't care about us
Oh and the trains aren't great
We're at 10pm for all alcohol sales on all days, tbh even though it's a minor irritant I quite like it and would gladly see it pushed back to 7-8pm
Happened to me more than once plus not that surprising when u think that Glasgow had the highest murder rate in Europe for 30 years straight starting in 1965
You make it sound like a war zone
Scotland is one of the safest countries in the world
If you looked into the stats you'd see that the majority of assaults are between under 16s and many many repeat incidences between individuals
You think Scotland is dangerous
Get out into the world, you don't know how lucky and safe you are
Yup [we're higher than South Africa] only place that comes close is our good old brother Northern Ireland
I imagine we're not actually higher than places like South Africa and the Congo and those rates are more due to recording differences but Scotland sure as hell is higher than the rest of Europe
Most of the ones I've seen have been outside the pubs or just after they or a club closed and people have poured out, so aye
Posturing and alcohol definitely increase it
Occasionally one of those two will drop but usually one of them features
Like 99% of all the assaults I've ever seen have been while drinking usually in the 2 to 3:30 am time slot
Am a bouncer though so there's a bit of a reporting bias there
It's the other way around, surely
If we made assault legal, the crime rate would plummet
I don't exactly think I made it sound like a war zone
As for getting into the world well I've lived abroad, I've travelled across 5 inhabited continents only missing Australia/Australasia
And I don't think the majority of assaults are between under 16s, I certainly can't find that in the official statistics
I would think the majority would be in the 18-30 category
In the summer it starts getting light here at 5am so I end up waking up much earlier than I need to
It stays bright until after 10pm at times
In winter it's dark when I leave to go to work in the morning and dark when I leave work to come home in the evenings and it's utterly, utterly depressing
A happy medium would be nice
Yeah Ireland's rate of assault (with very similar laws in a very similar country that you would expect to have extremely similar policing and reporting rates) in 2011 was  93
9 per 100,000 whereas Scotland's was 1,655
Probably the Highlands - all our internal rivalries are largely urban (ignoring the rivals within the Highlands themselves), so they're kept away from that, and everyone knows it's a beautiful part of the world
I dislike Cornwall
Unfortunately, the first few people I met from Cornwall were a bunch of backwards, insular, ignorant, small minded thick of pigshit bigots+, and its coloured my opinion of the place ever since
+To quote one, "there's a lot of nigg
no wait, can't say that
there's a lot of *negroes* in London, isn't there
Tbh, I wouldn't know enough to distinguish folk from the Southern regions
Same as I doubt folk would distinguish Northumbrians from Cumbrians
Balls
I did mean that haha
Just going it to change it to Southern to cover my bases
So *technically* I speak English
But I tend to use Scots words for functions when I can cause

In the old days, we used to answer by saying our city, town, or closest village and the last few numbers of our number
For example, “Edinburgh one oh nine two”.
These days my tendency is just “Hello” or my name - but my surname is double-barrelled and the whole thing works out at six syllables, so it’s not as simple as just “John Smith” or whatever, so usually just “hello
"Hello"
"Hi"
"Wit thu fuck do you want
"Whatsup"
Are all ecxeptible ways to answer the phone in Scotland
Traditionally 843AD but probably hard to actually indentify
The kingdom of Scotland was founded after the Pictish kingdoms, Dal riada, Strathclyde and Northumbrian Lothian were all united into one
This happened in the High middle ages I believe
Depends what you count
The precursor kingdom to Scotland was Dal Riata and was founded in 501 or 435 or 450 AD, or somewhere around there
People didn't really write much down in those days
&#x200B;
In 732 the kingdoms of Dal Riata and Pictand got the same ruler for the first time
&#x200B;
Kennith MacAlpine became king of Dal Riata and Pictland in 843 permenantly uniting the two kingdoms into the Kingdom of Scots/Kingdom of Alba
&#x200B;
I'd say 1177 years old is a decent figure to go with
I'm not sure how this history really works
Traditional founding date is 843 just combining Pictland and Dal Riada
Strathclyde wasn't integrated until the 11th century and the current border with Northumbria wasn't set until 1016
I can understand why you would think early Alba isn't synonymous with modern Scotland but it would seem to me that by the reign of the mad king Dòmhnall mac Chòiseim who adopted the title Rì Nan Albannaich (King of Scots/King of the Scots) we have Scotland
That was my reasoning yes, that Alba was north of the Fourth and Clyde
I see your argument as well like, just down to our definitions of when Scotland became Scotland
Perhaps leaving it until northumbrian Lothian was integrated is pushing it a bit, but I mostly look at it that way because Im from the Lothians :)
1) you can usually have what you need delivered
2) most cars have seats that fold up, so they honestly have as much cargo space as you’re ever likely to need
3) if your car isn’t big enough, there are plenty of hire services and friends with bigger cars
4) pickups just aren’t fashionable in Europe
They’re seen as cars for obnoxious dickheads, so no one has one unless they work on a farm
Maybe a bit lost in translation, it's called plasterboard in British English if that helps
The hilux wasn’t/isn’t exactly *common*, but they don’t have a particularly bad reputation like the others, it’s just that only people who actually need them would get one
I’ve seen a couple of fords here and there, but again only from people who regularly need a car like that
Ah, fair enough
Most houses built in the UK in the last few decades have plasterboard walls, or more accurately brick/breezeblocks on the outside, then a wooden frame with plasterboard and insulation in the cavities
We have nanny in English but it’s quite old fashioned now and not something you’d often hear
I’d say babysitter is the more informal of child minder
Yes, you’re probably right there
It’s perhaps a bit more middle class too
Ngl, I’m tempted myself, your highness
High school in England - we had "technology" a few times a week
It would be a few weeks of food technology (cookery, nutrition), textiles (sewing), resistant materials (wood and metal work), and IT
We'd loop between those four all year
To be honest, if you are applying for citizenship of an EU country, I think proficiency two out of the following three should be required: English, or the language of the country, or the language of another EU country
So if you want Swedish citizenship, and don't speak Swedish, but do speak English and, say, Polish, or German, or French, that should be ok
If someone wants to live in Wales they can learn Welsh if they prefer it over English as far as I care but I don't think learning the language of where you are going to live is too much to ask especially if you want to be a citizen
What if they lived in the useful 1% of the country
It's pretty quiet where I am
My (great) auntie who's 94 said when she was younger every single person knew eachother and everyone was friendly, but now the most it is would be taking in a parcel for them if they weren't home at the time of delivery
I used to be friends with my neighbour when we were younger, but even though we still live right next to eachother I haven't spoken to him in like 6-7 years
About 50-60 minutes by car
I think it's 65 or 70ish km one way
Hour on the train
20min drive, sometimes this can be up to 50min with traffic
20 minutes by car, 50 minutes by bus, 10 minute walk, then the same in reverse
Outside rush hour the bus drops to about 35 minutes, and the drive to 15

I'm sorry but voting for a racist makes you a racist
Wish I did
Everyone is racist against Roma
Even the otherwise liberal subreddit /r/europe shows its true colours when the subject of Roma comes up
Yeah but then all my (trying) healthy eating will be a waste
You know that's exactly what they said about the Jews in the 1930s. And the Roma for that matter
Oh cool so you're just an actual Nazi
Good to know
That the location of one of the more significant locations during the Jacobite Rebellions, a series of wars over the British crown that ultimately led to the destruction of the Highland clan system, is right below the viaduct made famous by the Harry Potter films, the one the steam train goes over
I just find it funny how just below the Glenfinnan Viaduct there is the monument commemorating the landing of Bonnie Prince Charlie
We lost our independence to an accounting error
The Defenestrations of Prague
Did it ever happen in any other city, or was it just a speciality of Prague
Nah Scotland was an independent country for more than a century after that
Yeah, makes sense that they'd be primarily centred there, seat of power as it is
Just was curious in case there were some other cases I had missed
The chippys that I have
Pretty much everything is deep fried
Deep fried pizza is a popular choice
Deep fried Mars bars are more for tourists, but it's still nice
Also I'm from the lothians where chippy sauce is poured over everything
Chippy sauce is hp brown sauce mixed with vinegar
You'll always be asked if you want salt and sauce
This sauce can divide the nation, with the west of Scotland really disliking it and not serving it
The sauce is only sold in the Lothians
Best chippys are often found in Fife
However, the best I've had was in Oban
It's super common in Germany
The SNP plan to introduce it here and all the dafties freaked out about it
Edit: Although in Glasgow you could return your glass Irn Bru bottles to the Ice Cream van when it came round your way
Are you sure you don't mean Australasia
I've heard it referred to that before, but Oceania is more common, and it's much harder to confuse with Australia the country
What
It's basic manners not to tromp through someone's house in your shoes
I'd be raging if someone came n did that at mine
As others have mentioned, we don’t really have a festive beer but we have loads of mulled wine and cider this time of year
More recently we have mulled gin, which is also lovely
But my favourite is a hot chocolate with Bailey’s.
I don't actually know if there's a proper one
I know there are certain alcohols popular over christmas like mulled wine and certain brandys and whiskeys
Personally my family have always had the tradition of drinking those big 1l bottles of Cobra (an Indian beer usually served in curry houses) but I'm pretty sure that's only us (though you should totally do that too it goes great with christmas dinner)
It's quite fashionable in rural parts of Scotland, but restricted in certain urban areas to prevent air pollution/smog
Edit: I may be wrong, wood burning stoves may be okay, but wood on an open fire is not
In rural places not in urban areas as much
It's not common here at all to have it as the only source of heat anymore although it was in the past (along with coal)
We still burn wood but it's an extra, we use heating oil for the central heating
Open fireplaces and woodstoves are common, even trendy in rural UK houses but they very rarely serve as the only form of heating these days
I buy my firewood, you used to be able to collect windfall firewood here from the state owned forests but they only rarely grant permission to do that these days which is a shame
I have bought it split and unsplit, the lazy in me buys it split these days though and usually by the ton - mostly hardwood, elm, beech and oak are plentiful here and are usually what the firewood guys supply
Wait where is it restricted
I'm probably wrong, I mixed up stoves and fireplaces
History was a little shit for me growing up
Our teacher in primary only thought us about Mary Queen of Scots, the Victorians, and worldwar II 5 years on loop
Granted her accent and attitude would make David Cameron look like a Glaswegian
I am overly proven to RSI due to muscle problems so got an alphasmart (bad laptop) from the state because it also affected handwriting and spelling
Except u wasn't allowed to use it for writing the 20 spelling words we got a day
I also got bullied constantly due to being unfit due to the same muscle problems
So I didn't get force to go outside to be bullied at lunch time tif I didn't do lines at home
So after a year of that she starts taking lunch off me until I do the lines, only getting fought the week I left the head teacher calls me out for being there constantly, and I told her what was going on like it was a slight drizzle outside
I think not letting your accent, and history being remembered and being remembered by the English is pretty much what they did to the rest of the world
Tokyo, Kyoto, Nagasaki, Hiroshima, Kagoshima, Nagoya, Sendai, Nara, Osaka, Sapporo, Himeji, Fukushima, Yokohama, Fukuoka, Gifu, Kobe
I think they're all cities at least
Hopefully I didn't slip in any historical names rather than current ones
Tokyo, Hiroshima, Kukura (dunno if thats speĺed right), Osaka, Nagasaki
Thats it
It's got to the point where so many presenters of nature documentaries adopt a hushed, slightly halting, breathy voice, without even realising they're doing an Attenborough impression
It’s quite difficult to say for the UK at the moment, but at a guess probably Jacob Reese-Mogg
Most politicians who campaigned heavily for brexit are strongly disliked by the left (for obvious reasons), but he goes a step further
A few years ago, there was a fire in a high rise apartment building in quite a poor area of London
Around 25 people where killed I think, and it has been a highly political topic ever since
This is due to the fact that the fire was so deadly because the owner of the building had not given it fire proof cladding or something like that to cut down on expenses, something which has been used as a kind of “capitalism kills/profits more important than human lives” situation
Jacob Reese-Mogg, in an interview a couple of years later, more or less said that if he had been in the fire, he would have survived “because he had common sense”, basically implying that all the people who died did so because they where too stupid to recognise smoke
He’s also the most stereotypical Tory on the planet, and his general demeanour is pretty much “posh prick who thinks he’s better than you because he has money”. Seriously, just google him
He’s an obnoxious, infuriating man
[Jesus wept, my head hurts]
I’m surprised no ones mentioned Reese-Mogg so far
My guess is he’s not that hated anymore cause the Tories won’t let him open his mouth since his Grenfell tower comments
But yeah Margaret thatcher is definitely the most hated generally, especially in northern England/Scotland
I remember seeing American prick on the internet a while ago
Why the fuck would they make him ambassador
That would be like us resurrecting Margaret thatcher and appointing her ambassador to Argentina
Is Jeremy Corbyn really all that hated in Wales
I thought the left was quite popular there
I mean, he’s not exactly popular in Scotland, but that’s more of a disappointment and ridicule thing than a hatred thing
Oh I forgot about her
Damn
I’ve been trying to figure out who’s the most hated, and every UK comment I’ve seen says a different person
See, all I’ve seen so far about him is praise, except from r/Scotland, which (rightfully) hates his guts
It seems to me that most people have been fooled by his briefings into thinking that he’s very vigilant and handling the situation well
> defenestrated
Accidentally, of course
> She’s really hated
Good
Fair enough
Aye we have cheese toastys, sometimes we deep fry them too
> I mean not a deep fried
Why not

Prince Andrew's close relationship with Epstein and photographic evidence of him with an underage sex trafficked girl
Also that interview really didn't help

Holy fuck that's a lot of bread
Basically, Balkan Hospitality (an entirely well deserved stereotype, by the way - some of the friendliest and most open-hearted folk I've ever met) consists of the world's most aggressive grannies trying to feed you inhuman amounts of bread
Apart from being force fed vast quantities of bread, you mean

I hate bucky
Litterally been called a plastic for it
I'm gonna get lynched for this but
i canny hold my drink
I speak neither Scots nor Gaelic naturally, and when I speak the former it's a horrific broad mixture of various Scots dialects
The latter I'm just trying to pronounce correctly right now
Depending on your view point this can either be quite embarassing and shameful or perhaps a good thing, shedding your 'cringy' Scottish accent
The prominence of that cringe only worsens my embarrassment on it
Thankfully I channel the feelings into some writing, so it's totally useless
But it does suck
It would never challenge my sense of being Scottish I don't think, but the assumption that people make that I'm English or British can be rather annoying
I once drank bucky in a glass
Scottish: I hate haggis, don’t like alcohol and don’t take drugs, I know I’m a disgrace
I don't like Buckfast tonic wine
It's a wine made by monks and is literally full of caffeine, so the alcohol lowers your inhibitions, but the caffeine buzzes you up, so you do really dumb shit
Basically it has a reputation for being the source of various crimes in Scotland
And it tastes absolutely awful

I lived in England for a few years, and there, raising your voice was (not shouting, just speaking up in a noisy environment or a large room) was considered rude, and mumbling was perfectly acceptable
I grew up in Austria,  where mumbling and speaking too quietly to be heard were considered really bad manners

*Scotland: the Promised Land* is a good documentary about the changes in Scottish society in the 20th century

*Darien, a short history*.
Tried to colonize Panama
Boy
Worse than Darien
Nova Scotia was a British colony
sort of
Nova Scotia was colonised by joint Scots and English efforts on behalf of the United crown (although the two countries were each independent, but part of the same kingdom)
Scots soldiers being used to support what was in essence an English colony was one of the motivations behind Darien
Probably Edinburgh, it's getting a bit ridiculous
Sort of spiraled with a situation where jobs were to be found here so people moved here and house prices went up which drew money into Edinburgh and exacerbated the existing cycle
We've gone up about 10% in population over the last 10 years which doesn't seem like it should mean much and it's not in terms of urban growth in other areas but Edinburgh has an issue where it's hemmed in by the Pentlands on one side and the Sea to the other meaning there's very limited space to build on
It's kind of resulted in an increased buildup in East Lothian but it's also caused a lot of problems in the city itself
You could maybe throw Dundee in there too for similar reasons
Tbh you could argue every city has developed the most since they’ve all kinda gone off and become a specialist city for something
I'd say Dundee too
It seems to have massively improved its reputation recently
I suspect it's an issue probably better solved by better transportation to the available land 10-20 miles to the east of Edinburgh where a lot of the new developments are going up
&#x200B;
The sea that borders on Edinburgh isn't a true sea it's part of the firth of forth which is a bit of the sea surrounded on both sides by land and fed by rivers, it's not my area of expertise but I imagine doing that could cause issues with maybe the flow of the water or causing it to flood other areas and I'm not sure the land would be that great for building anyway
Has Edinburgh really
If anything it's going down as it resembles London more and more with regards to the property market and nobody being able to afford to live there

Its very common to have a middle name
Some people don't and thats always odd to hear
The way to do it is slowly over time with different things
The UK is nearly entirely metric at this point with only the road system still using imperial officially
Even our beloved pints are actually defined metrically rather than being based on the imperial measurement (by law it's 568ml)
Also are things like rulers and measuring tapes not already both imperial and metric
All ours have both scales in the UK (same with analogue thermometers)
Some people in the UK smoke with the thumb/index combo
It isn't nearly as common as the other method but you wouldn't get many funny looks for doing it
I've tended to notice it with people who are sharing a cigarette (makes it easier to pass to each other, I suppose the same reason most stoners do it)
Where I grew up I always liked the [Cripps building] of St John's College
It is strongly contrasting with the other architecture of the college
In Edinburgh where I live now the [National Museum] is extremely cool, and of course there is the [Scottish Parliament] building
Nearby, and perhaps not what people immediately think of when they hear "modern architecture" is/was Charles Rennie Macintosh's [Glasgow School of Art] building
Agreed
Free Jetskis for all
I can only really see that decreasing turnout in a lot of nations
Unique parties for what is often a tertiary political election for most people, parties that most people won't be interested in finding out about and which could quite easily not align with local politics
People will prioritise national, regional and local elections, making EU politics use completely different parties carries the high risk of creating a barrier between the generally already uninterested masses and the voting process
As it stands, I think such a proposed change would risk watching already pretty low EU electoral turn out decrease further
We had an offhand comment about Russia invading Finland but The White Death often comes up in conversation between teenagers
We weren't but I studied it in my spare time because I love historym
Yeah
We had a Scottish, a British, and a World topic for Higher, with Russian Revolution being a common choice for the World topic, though there was a bunch of other options
They could also vary quite a lot in era (Scottish history could be anything from War of Independence in 1300s to WWI & Scotland (stuff like Red Clydeside and the Hebridean land occupations))
There is definitely room for things like the Winter War in the curriculum under the used model and it gives a nice spread of topics and historical situations if done right
That's not really founded in good science
The Radio 4 show/podcast More or Less dove into this subject a while back and the conclusion was that there was a hell of a lot more research needed but that the doom and gloom statistics came from a handful of studies that could not support the conclusions
The biggest doom and gloom stats came from biomass studies over single seasons decades apart and had no controls, ie, they never bothered to look for a stable population figure in the first place
If I recall correctly a meta study was done based on three such studies that were hyperlocal in the focus
None of them controlled for the first year potentially being a boon year for the insects and none accounted for there being potential factors for a hyperlocal extinction (eg, someone decided to get a pet bat and lived 10m from the study site)
None of the studies accounted for the types of creatures collected either, so we could have a declining big insect population but a strengthening small insect population
So yeah, we could be facing a bug decline but we actually have no idea

To be completely honest, I find it absurd that a lot of countries don’t. If I moved to another country, I would of course want to eventually become a citizen of that country
But if you make me give up my old citizenship in what seems like some pretentious, archaic method of ensuring loyalty towards my new country, then you can go fuck yourself
It’s not just potentially impractical, overly dramatic, and makes your country seem like it has an overinflated opinion of itself
It also just feels quite unwelcoming, like the government is saying “the only way you’ll *ever* be considered one of us is if you forsake any and all right to any other identity you may have
I am so thankful I have my German passport so I can still go visa free to the EU
A lot of people here seem to be against it, but I honestly haven’t seen anyone state *why* they’re against it
The closest I’ve seen is a few people say “it just doesn’t seem like that big a deal”, which really isn’t a good enough reason
When I typed this out I didn’t realise so many countries tied voting rights to citizenship, so that is also an important point
The UN recognises 195 countries in the world
Of those, 27 are in the EU
Yeah, I thought that was just how it worked everywhere
I’ve never seen any government record or form mentioning my dual citizenship, nor have I ever received any different treatment by government agencies for it
The British government just treats my how they treat every other British citizen, and if I go to Canada then the Canadian government just treats me like a Canadian citizen, and they don’t care about my British citizenship at all
I don’t see how that in any way affects the average Canadian other than if they really want their citizenship to feel special tho
Oh sorry you’ve misunderstood me
When I said “here” I meant “in this thread”, not “in the UK”.
I agree, I don’t think I’ve ever encountered a British person who’s against dual citizenships
Firstly, if someone spends a lot of time in both countries, then I think it’s entirely reasonable that they should be allowed to vote in both countries
Secondly, you could very easily just tie voting rights to residency rather than citizenship
Have it so citizens who haven’t lived in the country for x number of years can’t vote
Thirdly, does it really matter if someone lives in your country and doesn’t feel connected to it to the extent that they would happily give up on their home country entirely
That is a pretty fucking big ask
Why can’t they just be loyal to both
What in the hell is stopping them being loyal to both
Why is the right to a national identity entirely exclusive to a single country
Commonwealth citizens living in the UK can also vote in national elections
Yeah, it seems as though people from countries that already allow dual citizenship are completely ok with it, while people from countries that don’t allow it are quite strongly opposed to it
Although a work of fiction, the novel *Trainspotting* portrays the period in Scotland when the epidemic started to spread rapidly amongst intravenous drug users
The author, Irvine Welsh, was a housing officer with City of Edinburgh Council at the time, and much of the novel is based on both his own background, and the things he came across in that line of work
I'm told - I've not read it myself, I'm afraid - that the German memoir *Wir Kinder vom Bahnhof Zoo* (sometimes known as Christiane F in English) describes a similar situation in 1980s Berlin, especially amongst the homeless population
It was very bad here, mainly spread through needles rather than unprotected sex as Heroin had just come onto the market here in Scotland
The police continued to try and seize needles and other drug paraphernalia in an attempt to stop consumption but when your addicted to drugs you will do anything meaning in Edinburgh there was at one time only a couple hundred needles in circulation in the city
Meaning that reusing of spent needles was commonplace and drug abuse and HIV spread massively across Edinburgh and the Lothians and led to Edinburgh (specifically Leith) being known as the AIDS capital of europe
The very famous film "Trainspotting" is about this period, its famous in the UK and Europe but I don't know about the US
Hungarian
I don't understand a word of it, but it sounds so beautiful and exotic
It depends who it's coming from
Personally i think the banter between European countries is tidy, we spent years fighting each other and we all have troubled pasts and we all admit it
There's an honesty to that and Scottish humour is about being as bluntly honest and funny about life as you can be
You europricks can say whatever the fuck you want about whoever you want just make it funny and we are good
American's humor tends to be invasive, in your face and mean spirited (us v them mentalities) and they can't take it when you bite back
TL:DR Anyone so long as its funny
Palestine what the fuck
To be fair there are a lot of licenses here for stuff that might seem strange to some
Do you take it personally though
We give you a lot of grief but  apart from the nutjob nationalists, it's pub banter
Poland has a lot to be proud of, Poles were instrumental to the Allied victory in WWII in many ways
Polish codebreakers actually cracked the early war German enigma machines and were able to share this with the British which greatly helped the now famous work at Bletchley Park
Poles were also a massive part of the Battle of Britain making up the largest group of non-British pilots who fought and one Polish squadron, the 303 had a lower than average death rate than other RAF squadrons and yet was also the highest scoring Allied squadron during the Battle of Britain
Poland can also be proud of leading the way during the, mostly, peaceful dissolution of the Eastern Bloc which is really something people need to learn more about
Made in Germany = Made Well, particularly when it comes to tools
"St Patty's Day" is the best one, Cracks me up hearing that
I'd love to see someone call my uncle Paddy a Patty
Read that as garlic and lost my head laughing about you arguing with a vampire
The vampire didn't
It was either "bairn", "wean", "wee yin" or "little cunt" depending on the situation
> There's no British English, you have to learn American English
Annoying when you want to translate cinéma to cinema and not movie theatre etc, etc
I have a very specific moan about it
I've been using the Gaelic course and I keep getting marked down for saying "in *the* hospital" rather than just "in hospital". I realise that "in hospital" is a literal translation of whatever phrase is up but I'd never say that, I'd always say "the hospital".
Lying to a large audience; there's too many news articles or even politicians that just completely pull things out their arses to deceive everyone
Even politicians not keeping promises for no good reason
politicians can drink alcohol in the house of commons
This should be illegal and drug and alcohol tests should be brought in
Why can a politician make a decision that affects peoples life's when under the influence
In the UK being a republican (technically illegal but not enforced) or offending people online
&#x200B;
Also pay day lenders
Do you really want Westminster to have the power to effectively arrest Scottish politicians at will if they ever screw up
>video games that have gambling mechanics that involve real world money either directly or indirectly should either be illegal to be sold to minors or at least implement methods that lock that feature out of minor range (if possible)
Fuck, not even sure we have to make it illegal so much as class monetized (ie real life cash payments by users) lootboxes and EAs 'surprise mechanics'  as gambling and therefore requiring gambling licenses and associatef restrictions associated with gambling products
Do that, enforce it, they basically will be killed off
Why should being a republican be made illegal
It's a perfectly legitimate political view
> instead of cutting off a, let's be honest, pretty useless part
Should an appendectomy be given to everyone at birth as well then
an accident isn't a lie, lying is essentially intent to deceive
And I don't mean to send them right to jail, maybe even a hefty fine just so they'll be less inclined to create bullshit
Truth isn't subjective but governments also lie and when you give the state power to enforce truth you'll inevitably end up with a state that uses it for its own power
how can truth be subjective though
I'm talking about if they intend to deceive people with what they say, not if they make a slip up or something
A good example would be boris johnson and brexit as a whole
I read the question very wrong
In the UK being a republican is illegal and that fact annoys me
Are you saying that female genital mutilation should also be legal or just male genital mutilation
they're just making a comparison to female circumcision which i've heard is the equivalent to cutting off the top of the penis completely
But what happens if the court says it was intentional
And even ignoring that can you think of a single politician who has not lied at least once
Why would you think it would be evenly enforced
Ah okay, fair do's. Is it actually illegal
First time I've heard that
>That is already illegal, and much more intrusive and dangerous than male circumcision
This is a common misconception
You're assuming all FGM is the worst kind
When it can actually range from the "relatively" simple removing of the clitoral hood to much, much worse
>One other major difference is that female genital mutilation is not a core concept of (at least) two major world religions, so the decision to make it illegal is much more obvious
Utterly fucking irrelevant
I'm sorry for swearing, but that it literally utterly **fucking** irrelevant
We're talking about people mutilating babies and your worried about hurting Bronze Age cultists feelings
>Male circumcision is a comparatively minor surgery
As someone else pointed out tattooing babies is significantly more "minor" because it's no longer a permanent act
I never understood the need to differentiate genital mutilation
It should be illegal to preform on children of any gender
Of course it's less common
It's fucking illegal
it might be because i'm tired, but I really don't know what you're on about
I'm talking about lying with intention to deceive a large audience out of malice
Yeah, but there is also a certain benefit to having a relatively famous living monarchy
Flogging stuff during the royal weddings, jubilees, hell, even advertising on press stories about the family, these things get gobbled up by certain audiences abroad to a decently pretty penny, in addition to the actual sites
Plus the whole theatre of the guards seems to generate different interests from say the traditional but uninhabited castles in Scotland like Stirling, Edinburgh and Urquhart
It's a weird one, the pageantry probably does generate some additional interest and ability to make money even from international audiences who aren't visiting
I personally don't much care for them, but there does seem to be a fair number of little industries built around a living monarchy, from publications to 'commerative' tat
Last time it was actually enforced was something like the 1970s and it might not stand up to things like the human rights act or ECHR these days but yeah technically it's still illegal
>Treason Felony Act 1848 Section 3
>*If any person whatsoever shall, within the United Kingdom or without, compass, imagine, invent, devise, or intend to deprive or depose our Most Gracious Lady the Queen, from the style, honour, or royal name of the imperial crown of the United Kingdom, or of any other of her Majesty’s dominions and countries, or to levy war against her Majesty, within any part of the United Kingdom, in order by force or constraint to compel her to change her measures or counsels, or in order to put any force or constraint upon or in order to intimidate or overawe both Houses or either House of Parliament, or to move or stir any foreigner or stranger with force to invade the United Kingdom or any other of her Majesty's dominions or countries under the obeisance of her Majesty, and such compassings, imaginations, inventions, devices, or intentions, or any of them, shall express, utter, or declare, by publishing any printing or writing ... or by any* *overt act* *or deed, every person so offending shall be guilty of felony, and being convicted thereof shall be liable ... to be transported beyond the seas for the term of his or her natural life
Since transportation to Australia was stopped in 1868 the penalty now would be life imprisonment
&#x200B;
The last time it was used was 1972 to charge some members of the IRA but those charges were dropped in favour of the more realistic charges relating to terrorist activities
&#x200B;
In 2013 the government confirmed it was still on the books but also effectively said it would never be used
I see what you're saying but there are numerous reports in my country (and I'd assume all over Europe) of little girls being taken back to Africa or the Middle East to have FGM preformed
And I don't think the numbers vary as much as you may assume
According to Google approx 1 in 4 men are circumcised
If there's 7 billion of us that's about 875 million males
Whereas according to Wikipedia UNICEF estimated  a few years ago that the number of women who have gone through FGM is about 200 million
It not a huge gap
I'm sorry
In Greenock there’s the cat man of greenock, who supposedly was a Russian sailor who broke his legs when his ship came ashore and couldn’t get back so he has survived for the last 40 years on rats
Could also be the mascot of greenock Morton who is also a cat
I presume Näcken (or a Polish derivative) inspired the Nekkers in the Witcher
They seem very similar
Christ, poor guy
Breaking your legs is one thing, but doing it in *Greenock*... no one deserves that
Wouldn’t know cos the only place in Greenock I’ve really cut about is the Little Sisters of the Poor n I don’t think he’d cut about there imo
That's normal for the UK as well
*Friendship ended with Canada
Terrible
Usually the host will buy in some crates of beer and a couple bottles but nothing more than that
I don't know German but if there's a debate about it I can't see why it shouldn't just be put down as neutral
It's interesting, it's not something we have a specific word for and it's always something I've taken for granted
Just the other day I drove to a fairly remote one with some friends to climb a hill
Slept in the car, and there was a pretty nice toilet block as well
Hate; that we hate English people
The vast and overwhelming majority of Scots don't hate English people
Ammused by; alcoholism
like for most European countries its like the spiderman pointing at spiderman meme
U do tho
scotland probably has more junkies than alcoholics if I'm being honest
I'm English (but essentially an adopted Scot by this point) and I do enjoy people who haven't spent any meaningful time up here telling me how much the people I love, the people I live and work with and the people I've been surrounded by every day for nearly a decade hate me
I mean aye there's idiots who would probably make it an English thing but most I've suffered is a bit of banter
And now I get "well, you're basically Scottish now anyway
" half the time
Agree on the alcohol one
Though I've noticed it swings between some nationalities calling us a bunch of alcoholics and other proudly proclaiming something close to alcoholism (I can drink X amount in Y time) because of ancestry
As for how I'd answer OP's question from an English perspective: I'm from Yorkshire so find it amusing that people like to characterise all of us as tea drinking, crumpet eating poshos with clipped accents
Though I do love tea it has to be said
I just don't have time or even a big enough house to sit around in the afternoons like I leapt from the pages of a Jane Austen novel
Hate that it's assumed that many of us are anything but largely indifferent to the royals
There's a few absolute weirdos who will camp out for a week in London when there's a wedding or a baby due but most English people don't care that much
Indeed
Very interesting read I must say
And yeah you're right theres a few fannies here and there that gee it "ah fuckin hate the English" but its mostly just patter
Not a fan of drunken Irishman patter
Apparently that stereotype came from people stealing sheep years and years ago when there were laws where you'd get a finger or whatever cut off for having sexual relations with a sheep but something worse (can't remember) for stealing it, so every welsh sheep thief just said they had sex with it to get the lesser punishment
I don't know how accurate this is, I found it on reddit a fair while ago
Nah but yous do tho
I suppose so, just a laugh but innit
They're at it too like
Aye mate x
Depends on the weather and what I'm doing
I went biking in the Highlands last year where it was a sunny 13 degrees and I felt comfortable in a short-sleeved shirt
I brought a light jacket with me in case the weather took a turn but it would've been too hot to wear it most of the time
I'd say if I'm not moving a lot, the sun is out, & there's not much wind - probably 14 or 15
> Though I might as well wear a jacket if it's under 25°C.
Anything between 15 and 25 degrees is tops off, shorts on sunbathing weather for us northerners
To be fair in the winter you can sometimes see folk here cutting about in shorts when it's 2 degrees out haha
I've seen barbecues being set up at 13°C a few weeks ago lol
I'm quite fond of the shorts and hoodie combination myself
It's interesting how you can pick out different nationalities in St Andrews
The Americans with their shorts and flip flops, the English with their red trousers and the Scottish with their Fife Council work gear
(Obviously I'm taking the piss a bit, my partner went to St Andrews and there were a few other Scottish accents there but not all that many)
He’s one in a million
Scottish independence failure and brexit
Former no voters are switching for independence as the government does not seem to care about Scotland, they are doing a great job at convincing us to stay
Kyiv (which I've visited three times since 2014) is a pretty cool city
It feels really like you are deep in the middle of a transition from a 'post-Soviet country' to a 'normal European country, but with a cool edgy vibe'.

The Norwegian Antarctic expedition is made so much more impressive than it would otherwise be given that Norway had only become independent 6 years earlier
His family don't give anything away
Nobody knows his actual condition
The most recent update was a good few years ago where we were told he could not walk
My grandad was an RAF recovery mechanic during the Berlin Airlift
He was always proud of his service, and despite growing up in an era when Germany were "the enemy", retained a fondness for the ordinary people of Germany from his time stationed there
I'm 35, my four grandparents were born in these years; 1902, 1903, 1907 and 1909
Unfortunately this also means that I met only one of them, the one born in 1909
She lived to a ripe old age and died in 2005
My parents were born in 1945 and 1946
The majority of my peers had parents born in the mid - late 50s/early 60s. So I had an older family
Yep, the way I was brought up was patently different to how my peers were brought up
They had more freedom and a more "relaxed" up bringing
There are of course other factors to that but this is a generalisation
Almost all of my peers' mothers had either a full or part time job
My mother was a housewife all of her post marriage days
The shift in culture is remarkable
My parents themselves were the products of older parents so some very traditional values were still evident in my household
We haven't, have claimed to be the new Greece once though
None unless you count those times I was drunk and found a toga
Ha Rome ain't shit
Scotland was a pretty major centre for the European enlightenment so there's bee a lot of claims that we're the inheritors of the ancient Greek philosophical tradition
In the 19th century we even tried to make a replica of the Parthenon before running out of money
Same in Glasgow
Doesn't stop us though
No; "big screen" would generally be the word used in UK English, but even then it doesn't quite work as a noun, and the "big-screen" still refers to the method of showing it and not the event
"They've set up a big-screen".
And interestingly 'trek' was borrowed from Dutch
Due to how many people in very poor contries both speak English and have access to the internet we get a lot of phone tech scams some of which are extremely sophisticated
I visited Belarus about 4 years ago when I was in my travelling phase
I actually really liked it, honestly one of the best countries I've visited on mainland Europe
All the people seemed pretty nice, authorities were generally easy enough to deal with, no one (that I know of) tried to scam me or anything like that, didn't get anything nicked, never felt unsafe or anything like that, didn't feel remotely as dodgy as some other bits of eastern Europe
I had the pleasure of visiting it 2 years ago but I only felt safe due to the group I went with had friends down in Cape Town where we were
The one time I went to the toilet in a “shopping mall” I was followed to the toilet but I am a rather tall and could say intimidating due to my size and nothing happened but if I was smaller then I might have gotten things stollen from me
I would go back but I would probably stick to the more affluent areas which is a real shame
I still dream about the Langos I had in Hungary 5 years ago
And flammkuchen, definitely a flammkucken fan
Was not expecting the pun lol
You should try it in Scotland
Also broodje americain
Basically a raw meat paste on a bread roll
When I moved there I thought I’d never try it
Eventually I did and I’ve loved it ever since
Also love fritjes met stoverij and mayonnaise
I dont think there is anything a Belgian won’t put mayo on
That’s a bit of a reach from what little info is on that wiki
All it says is that there was a reference to it from Los Angeles that’s old but the wiki lists older references and goes into similar dishes that likely inspired it
Marks and Spencer’s sometimes have it in
I was just kidding - it's a Scottish dish
I love it too, they sometimes serve a gourmet version of it at Scottish weddings - it's the only reason I go if I'm invited, tbh
Yeah true, much more black and white pudding here but if you see it, it’s definitely worth trying
A nice whiskey cream sauce with it and you’re sorted
Oatmeal is there to bulk it out because oats are the only thing that traditionally grew here, and in the past killing animals was rare and expensive so you had to make it last
Most people are saying some that are *disliked* by the general public, but imo the Saltire  is generally under appreciated as we are usually just lumped in with the Union Jack
The original saltire flag where the cross is gold rather than white, and the lion rampant royal banner are underappreciated
The current government have also ruined the saltire, but that's another story
Fella who lives a few doors down from me has a confederate flag in his car on display on the top of the boot
Not a clue why, I'm sure they're Romanian and while I don't understand why anybody would want to show that flag off, I especially don't understand why non-Americans would
Don't think it's under appreciated
You see it everywhere and on loads of products
Always see it on salmon and strawberries
In what way have they ruined the saltire
Theyve appropriated it and made it a symbol of arrogance and bigotry
It no longer represents Scotland in the eyes of it's people, just represents the SNP
Hahahaha
I’ve only ever heard that from the most fanatical of fanatic Unionists, it’s quite cringeworthy
You might want to get rid of the saltire next to your user name and replace it with a Union Jack then mate
We know the people who love waving that around are all very tolerant none of them bigoted in the slightest
I'm not a "fanatical unionist", and you're only proving my point
You're trying to say that people who arent members of the SNP arent really Scottish
As if the 2 are connected
National flags should be kept out of politics
I didn’t say you weren’t really Scottish at any point
I’m just surprised you have the saltire on your username given your views
You are the one who has allowed politics to taint your view of something as simple as a national flag
People who support Scottish Independence, funnily enough, like to use the national flag of Scotland
I just find it astounding that any normal person would allow this to taint their view
Kerby/Kirby
Kick a football against the kerb on the road so that it bounces back to the kicker (as opposed to missing the kerb and going into someones garden or down the road)
Try to get it consistent as possible and better than the other people you're playing with

Chap door run
Knock someones door and run away

That was called the "Jessie Test" in Scotland in the late '90s, although generally it was done with a coin or a bit of hard plastic

Kids
I play this with my partner
We call that "Battery Codes" where I'm from
There's also "Codes", but that's for losers as they just had to give up their letter when you caught them rather than beating it out them
Sounds sort of like two(ish) games we had, Codes and Battery Codes
In codes if you caught someone they had to give you their letter, in Battery Codes you had to beat it out of them
We always chucked balls when playing kerbie, I've never seen it done with kicking
Our kerbie rules allowed you to go into the middle of the road and make a second attempt if you got a kerb and it landed back in your half of the road
My pal got the greatest shot I've ever seen, it was a backwards, over the head shot
He hit the opposing kerb, hit his kerb on the bounce then landed right in the middle of the road

It sounds like Japanese because Finland was invented by the Japanese as a ploy to get more fishing territory

Scotland only has one big city, and whilst it's not as well known as the capital, most people are aware that Glasgow is a city in Scotland - if only because it hosts a relatively famous football rivalry
Aberdeen, Inverness, and Perth are always forgotten
People only know of Glasgow and Edinburgh

‘How do you like my new haircut

Also extremely punctual, except when it comes to trains
For a nation that values punctuality so much I was quite surprised when I lived in Germany that train delays (like everywhere else) are very commonplace
One of my bests mates is like this
We agree to meet in the pub at 8 and he strolls in at 9:30 and I'm half drunk because I'm not going to stand in a pub myself without a beverage
I've got to the point that whatever time we agree on, I know I've got at least an hour before I actually need to be there

I try to take the train where it is possible to get from departure to destination in one day; if a train journey would involve an overnight stay, I fly
I'd also fly if I have to get to an early meeting or something and it just wouldn't work to get the train
But as a general rule, the train is my first choice for any journey of less than about 7 hours
(All this is in the old days, of course, before Covid destroyed travel
If I was travelling inside Scotland, train but If I am going England or further i fly
You guys are portrayed in movies
Scotland isn't a tribal warrior society or a drug addled shit hole  (at least in most places)
The hell are you on about we're one of the most popular places to set a movie especially relative to our size
I don't know when I learned to ride, but it was really early
Various years our big present for the year (combined Christmas and Birthday) would be bicycles, when they needed replacing due to growth
It's fairly common for most to know how to, and there are sometimes cycling safety classes later in primary school, but a lot of people don't generally cycle, which is why it was quite notable that I cycled between the villages and over the various hills and Braes to school sometimes, and later for work
I believe I was maybe 7-8
I couldn't ride a bike that we had because we were staying on some large(ish) campsite so to get to the main amenities was either a fairly long walk or a cycle
So I kinda forced myself to learn then
Didnae learn until I was 13
Some Irish legends might be a nice change, they never get enough love

Not whatever the order 1886 was
The 30 years war or the wars of the 3 kingdoms would make excellent games
I've always thought that a fun quirky twist on WW2 would have you playing as communist partisans in Yugoslavia
You would find yourself fighting against Nazi occupation and the Ustaste and would fight alongside the Chetniks until a character (maybe a brother or family member who works for the chetniks) reveals they are secretly working for the Nazis
This as such leads to you being captured by the Gestapo and betrayed and you have to escape and hunt them down
I have always thought that a game where you play as a guerilla which has unique stealth components but gradually more open action sequences as the game finishes towards the end of the war in the yugoslavian countryside of hills and mountains would be awesome
Maybe it sounds better in my head
Another good idea would be a game about the spanish civil war, the conflict was very brutal if you ever need an account the spanish holocaust is a good book
But a game set starting either in 1934 or 1936 of a family based somewhere like Salamanca or Badajoz
They are poor peasants who struggle to get by due to the brutal autocratic landlord
We could have one of the protagonists in love with the landlords daughter but eventually Francos collumn would come and would devestate the town and the family would witness the brutal massacre of Badajoz probably with some of the family being killed
Eventually our protagonist flees and eventually ends up in Madrid where he takes part in the seige of madrid where he witnesses the frictions between communists  and Democrats
After several missions of fighting and bombings eventually Madrid falls to nationalist forces and our protagonist is executed
Yeah you guys don't get enough love in some ways I think, could be biased being a Scot and all
"Those Scotch bastards"

I have to say I've never heard many Irish nicknames apart from the usual anti Catholic stuff
Septic tanks
We learn about the causes of the war, the rise of the NSDAP, Hitler's policy to expand Germany's borders to create more Lebensraum for the German people
As for the course of the war, it took on a very British slant
Most lessons focussed on the Battle of Britain, the bombing of British cities by the Luftwaffe, rationing of food and evacuation of children from British cities, and D-Day
We also spent some time learning about Germany's invasion of the USSR and some important battles there
We spent almost no time though learning about the war in Africa, the far east or in Italy
Yeah, I found this rather odd because we, at least in Scotland, learned the same stuff over and over each time the topic came up in class
I actually only know as much as I do about both world wars and the subsequent conflicts (eg
Cold war, korea, Vietnam, etc
) because I took a personal interest beyond what was taught
We get that in Scotland too :)

In Edinburgh, every street is pretty much unique, in a unique direction and connecting to unique places
It's probably stupidly complicated, but for somebody who grew up here, I could be plopped on any random street in the city and pretty much know where I am and make it home without a map
Plop me in a grid and I'm fucked
It looks like Garry's Mod or Half Life maps were transplanted into reality
Oddly enough, I kind of like it
I associate that run down, source engine appearance with the early 2000s, which makes it feel quite nostalgic
The first picture actually looks like it's in some random Brazilian city, which I guess makes sense
What's it called
Remember when they made an advert to encourage people and businesses to move there
Tolkien based Mordor off of the Industrialisation of Britain I believe, so yes, it literally is it
I applied for a job in Tilburg the other day, I'm glad to not see it on here either  But tbh I'm from the worst city in Scotland so it would be fitting to move to the worst city in ND
Sorry, don’t know who that is
Yes
I live and work in England and it doesn't matter how much I tone it down, someone will still pretend they don't understand me
I have a very strong  Scottish accent (broad Scots as we say in Scotland
) and when me and my wife were on holiday in Italy we were sat a table for dinner in our hotel with about 5 other couples
It was an outside barbecue type thing where you went up to the grill and got your food there
After sitting talking to the other couples for a bit I went up to get me and wife some desserts and when I came back I could tell by my wife’s face that she was not happy
Apparently while I was away one of the women at the table complained to my wife that she couldn’t understand a word I was saying
And then others started agreeing with her
She told us to just leave the desserts and we left and she told me what happened afterwards
I wasn’t bothered at all but you do not mess with someone my wife cares for
In Scotland not really, I kind of mostly unintentionally purged my native Dundonian accent through years abroad and at university and now have a difficult to place lowland accent that isn't clearly of anything and isn't easy to place on the working-middle class spectrum
Abroad I do though, but mostly in good humour
Yes
I live in a different part of the country to where I grew up, so I get mocked for it
I don't get bad impressions, but I do get called "chookta"+ a lot
+The Glaswegian pronunciation of *teuchter*, meaning "country-dweller". I'm not from the countryside, but some Glaswegians seem to be under the impression that Scotland = Glasgow + a couple of crofts
People have done yeah but not often
Usually its other Scottish people who do because I have a very strong accent
Sean Connery's barely even got a Scottish accent
I wish us teuchters had a word for them, toonser just does nae really do it
You're pretty correct
I've found a lot of similarities in pronunciation between German and the Scottish dialect
It's like a cheat code that makes learning German easier for us
When I'm back up the road I get called a toonser, because I'm from the city and not the shire
"Weegie" or "weegie mink" works for the locals where I am the now
We also have words like "Ken", which means "Know". I'm sure it's sort of similar to the word in German
They are usually paid
I can't fully answer your second question - I'm not sure if it's legal or not, but companies might offer "work experience" which is often the same work as an internship but it is unpaid
Internships in general aren't very common - most common areas are banking, finance and consulting
I quite like it
New buildings aren't as exciting, but I love the Empire State, Rockefeller centre, the PANAM building (fuck off Metlife), and the Chrysler [(IMO the Chrysler building is the pinnacle of Skyscraper design, nothing on earth beats its iconic appearance]
However, the metro looks like it hasn't been upgraded since the 1980s. From a purely practical standpoint, it's fine in getting you around the city, but it really is smelly and dirty looking
The city itself is also quite dirty, albeit I've seen similar levels of grime back home so it didn't phase me too much
Yeah the metro is really weird
It runs 24/7 and gets you to places, but it's fucking ugly to look at
London manages to have a good metro, I expected NYC's to be equal to it
All that broken windows shit has been mostly discredited now
Rudy Giuliani was good at self promotion but he was a fucking knob
I think the grid system actually works well, for Manhattan
Maybe it's cause I'm just a visitor/tourist, but I appreciate how easy it makes navigation
Downtown Manhattan, which is still largely adhering to the colonial street layout, didn't feel any better or more interesting than the northern half of the island
I guess wind tunnels can be a real issue though
As a Weegie I definitely appreciated New York's grid layout as it is very much like Glasgow city centres grid layout
The major difference is Glasgow doesn't have numbered streets, where as a lot of (most of
) New York City's streets are numbered
I like it for for the same reasons that I like STALKER and Metro 2033 games
Yeah, I don't know anything about running a metro, but I imagine running 24/7 is a real challenge for them
Cleaning, repairing, and upgrading while still having to serve riders must be a massive headache
> Why would you expect NY’s metro to be as good as London
Because New York City is a pedestrian city
Most New Yorkers don't own cars and they learn to drive at an older age than most Americans
It's also a rich city, so funds shouldn't be an issue
It has the grime and wear of a "lived in" city, it doesn't look sterile or artificial
But still, if I were a local I'd probably be quite sick of dealing with that
We don't all have to be as clean as Tokyo, but that station looks like it's been abandoned for decades
>  a lot of them complain about the attention NYC gets and don’t want their taxes used to fund city public transit that they won’t personally use
Of course, despite the fact that NYC, as a rich city, keeps their bumblefuck towns solvent
Tbf I think I can sympathise with the upstaters on this one
In the UK, the centralisation and focus on London is considered quite detrimental to the rest of us
It'd be nicer to be more decentralised like Germany is, instead of having one big city hogging up everything and leaving the rest of the country with leftovers
My favourite is the film ‘Jaws’ which in French is known as ‘Les Dents de la Mer’
The Teeth of the Sea doesn’t have quite the same ring to it
Lol I love how optimistic you’re being with the >!”one will live” part
Like, sure, she’s still alive at the end of the book, but let’s give it a month or so before we make any assumptions y’know
Quite a lot of times
Worst time (probably) was when I turned my back on the wrong guy while working a door and ended up with a knife stuck between my shoulderblades
Fun times
Someone robbed my house when I lived in Dundee
Was pretty traumatic, as it was the junkie couple that lived across the hall from us

It’s actually not at all a poorly written or recorded song, and it’s quite catchy
It’s just a bit weird
This is quite interesting, it makes me think about Britannia and Columbia, which represent Britain and the USA respectively, are both female personification with Latinish names
Is this a theme for other nations
Britannia is the female personification of Britain and I've seen the UK refered to as the "mother country" specifically in regard to British born Canadians volunteering for the First World War but I don't know if that was a truly common held thought at the time
Growing up and going to school in Canada I couldn't say that there is much of a personification of Canada or even any of the provinces but maybe
I know that there are 2 personifications of the USA one being female and one male
Columbia being the female personification and Uncle Sam being the male one which is usually used in a less "pure" or "idealistic" context than Columbia usually is
Edit:Columbia not Colombia
Never seen one before
In the 5 places I've lived long enough to remember the windows, 3 of these had these, one was a high rise student flat so didn't have them for safety, and only one just didn't have these
I think they're still fairly common
You're right
I don't really get the people saying they're not common
Every flat I've ever lived in, including my parents, had them
WonderWhy is really good and is a bit like CGP Grey
Gary marly ised to befunny but idk cos I haven't watched him in an age
He's an arse
How so
Just one example: in one video, I think it is about a bronze age battlefield, he spent longer complaining about the use of the metric system in describing a bone than he spent on the significance of said specimen
Well your president used to have two amazing Bernese mountain dogs so it makes sense
RIP Síoda x
I thought you were way off but after researching it there are actually more cats than dogs adopted in the UK
But more people have dogs than cats, which means cat owners are likelier to have more than one (aka crazy cat ladies)
I think most people here will know about Gaelic and Scots so let's throw in a strange one
Beurla reagaird is the traditional language of the highland travelers/highland Scottish gypsies today only spoken by a few dozen elders
Scottish Gaelic and Old Scots
Old Scots is believed to be time capsule of medieval English
Don't know
All I'm pulling up from a search is the Old English dialect and the modern dialect
England has quite a lot of dialects, to be fair
Might be wrong, but never heard of Northumbrian as a language
Yeah, it's got about 1
7 million speakers, the largest minority language in Europe
Theres a difference, although technically called just 'Scots' people in the UK often mistake it for the local dialect of Glasgow, when in reality one is a language and one is a slang
People here tend to call it Old Scots to make the distinction
make sure you have all the correct documents and we might keep you
I own a high end electric bike
Here living without some form of transport would be a bit iffy but an electric bike does fine
You could use a regular bike but the hills here are killer
Yes, living in the countryside with absolutely garbage public transport
I don't own a car but if I wanted to work in the nearest town I would really need one as the last bust back to where I live is at 6pm and that's during the week
Not at all
I live roughly a mile and a half from the city centre, plenty of cycle paths to get me there, and if the weather was too bad for cycling, great bus and subway links to the city centre
There's absolutely no reason for me to get a car currently, it would just be a waste of money
Is that fish Jenga
I'm not 100% of the cut-off for where is or isn't in the Balkans so no doubt I'll make a mess of this
Personally I'd say Sarajevo
You've got the assassination of Franz Ferdinand and the Siege of Sarajevo
I've also got family there so I might be biased
I would say Belgrade, but if Istanbul or Athens counts as Balkan, that changes things
Given the way some folk still go on about it, *Kosovo Polje*.
I know of Belgrade through the whole Kosovo situation but I admit I don't know a whole lot
To me Balkan = former Yugoslavia, even if this is putting the cart before the horse
“Why use that definition when you know it isn’t right
Well there is a presumption here that I know what the correct definition is, but that isn’t actually the case
I knew that Albania for example was part of the Balkans (even though it was not part of Yugoslavia) but not Romania for example
In fact, the question of which countries count as “Balkan” appears to be a matter of dispute in this discussion board, and even in histories of the region if my memory of Misha Glenny’s book on the topic serves me correctly
When it isn’t clear what the correct usage is, people usually reach for the most straightforward explanation: hence the reference to Yugoslavia
I acknowledge this is ahistorical but nonetheless I am sure it is what would be understood by most people around me
The other Balkan nations would probably be seen as distinct entities (with Albania as a possible exception)
Greece is Greece, Turkey is Turkey etc
You are quite right to point this out as being equivalent to equating all of the United Kingdom to England
but it’s also a very common mistake
Hopefully that explains it a bit, and I apologise if I was being too flippant in my first post
The Balkans is a peninsula, named for the mountain range
I don't think anyone can just go about digging in their back garden and find anything worth while but it's pretty common to just see walls and know they're old as shit
>500 - 1000: At this point you're mainly looking at ruins and castles
They're scattered across the country and often take time to reach, but you won't just walk upon one on your daily commute
This is the period of our history which is the least densely packed
The Britons, Anglo Saxons and Vikings were not the greatest builders
Also includes ruined walls and artificially widened streams for ships, from the vikings (they exist in the isles)
> Any time before 0AD: Extremely rare
You're looking at things like Stonehenge and the Knap of Howarr
Both of those things were more ancient at 0 AD than things from 0 AD are now
There is quite a lot of 500bc-0ad stuff scattered around Scotland
It hasn't been built over because we have nothing built for most of the country
On that note, Christopher Lee (aka Dracula, Count Dooku, and Saruman) made a metal music video about Charlemagne defeating the Saxons, believe it or not
[I SHED THE BLOOD OF THE SAXON MEN]
Yeah I suppose it can be controversial, but Christopher Lee is apparently able to trace his ancestry back to Charlemagne, so he decided to just go ahead and make a whole metal album about his distant grandad when he was in his mid 80s.
You're never too old to try out new stuff lol
I know lots about the EU, it's full of communist nazis, the paper that used to have boobs in it told me
We were at least taught about the EU member states and the Eurozone
I still have my wee EU book from primary school
It's true, don't forget the candles either would someone think of the candles
How dare you try and suggest we leave the greatest islands in the world
I use an M-Ticket on my phone for the bus
I used to have a travel or "ridacard" as we would know them but I don't use the bus as much so I just use single tickets on my phone

Have had Germans weirdly aggressive about calling Scotland a country, but that's a separate matter
Oh I see, so it’s not really curiosity about Poland but an attempt to show off
Fair enough
My (Scottish and English) family live in the North of England but are about to move back to Scotland
They had a delivery guy come to the house who caught wind of the fact they were moving and asked them if it was because of independence, that he “liked Scotland” and why they want to leave the UK
They are moving to help care for my grandmother
I used to visit with my partner back when we lived in CZ, and we even preferred it to Prague
I don’t think my family even gave him an answer
Telling them it was because of my grandmother would have probably made him feel awful so I don’t think they did
I think that in general it’s bad form to discuss politics in these situations
I have my own views, which some people would probably describe as radical, but I’m not going to bring them up at work or when I am talking to strangers because it’s unnecessarily divisive
The merits of EU membership, Scottish independence, abortion rights etc
are not relevant to day to day interactions and serve only to hurt interpersonal relationships unnecessarily
Scotland, despite being small, is in some ways one of the parents of the modern world, having invented or discovered so many things that make our current society possible: [Scottish Inventions and Discoveries (it's long)]
Think the condensing steam engine, various electronics discoveries, tropical medicine, penicillin, insulin, television, bicycles (including pneumatic tyres), telephone, the principles of radio, ATM and PIN
So many more
Our national animal is the unicorn and Edinburgh has been named best city to live in on the planet and most depressed city on the planet officially
Considering your username I’m not sure what to make of that comment
Well we've likely had their genome sequence, so I'm pretty sure I could bring them back
Or failing that bug my uni lecturers who do that as a job to bring them back
Of all places, there had to be a riot at the *Peace and Friendship Stadium*...
In the UK football fans are kept segregated, rugby fans are all in together so that probably sums up how unlikely violence amongst the fans is
Rugby is the number 2 team sport here, but it's a distant second to football
When there's a big rugby international in Edinburgh, there's lots of issues, but it's mainly due to excessive alcohol consumption, rather than organised fighting
There's a bit of classism at work, and the media will describe rugby fans as "rowdy" where football fans would be called "thugs" for similar incidents
I'm now trying to imagine toffs having a scrap
Aye, it's class eh
I'm not a football fan but the atmosphere certainly seems better in Germany than back home
Get into an argument with our spouse and tell everyone we're getting a divorce and then not follow through

Also probably attack Poland with a spoon because he looked at us funny

Aye, no bad, yersel

We never learned about actual Scottish history except in primary school (from which I only remember the jacobites, not even who they were or what they did)
In high school the "Scottish" unit was about WW2 and the only Scottish part was the names of some of the Scottish regiments and stuff
So basically I know nothing about my own country
Just bits and bobs like our failed attempt at a colonial empire
Pretty funny but never looked at it in school really
Edit: also the real story about how the act of union happened
The Darian scheme and Roman era history would have been cool
The Wars of the Three Kingdoms were never really covered in enough detail, and seemed to focus on the English parliament vs monarch view, where the events throughout these islands have a huge influence on the way the UK is today
I almost feel that it should be looked at as a wider period between the Union of the Crowns and the Union of the Parliaments
British food is shit
Yeah it was forty years ago
Now it's a world-class fusion of every cuisine you could possibly imagine (because it *was* shit)
The most famous chefs in the world are French
The second are British
When did someone make that comment
I've worked with loads of Romanians
Absolutely lovely folk, every one of them, a couple are still good mates who I'll still go for a pint with, now and then
But every single one hated the gypsies who will steal your TV :)
It would appear Scotland, Denmark and Skåne all have at least one thing in common
Jeffrey Epstein and pizzagate are two very different things
They exist, my SIL is currently working at one, but they aren’t the same as American ones
The kids only stay one or two nights at a time, or not at all, instead heading home every day
The staff are only on 4 days at a time as well
They are quite rare
More of an American import than a tradition
Most families would rather go on a holiday together than ship the kids away for the summer
The closest we have would be things like scout week when all the troops get together for a huge event out on a country estate somewhere
Yes
We got that
It didn't need explaining
You American very clever
We in awe
Honestly, I'm really bad at this
Most of the time, I tend to stay away from dentists unless I have toothache, and then I get such remedial action taken as needs to be done
I was frightened of dentists as a child and that fear has never really gone away
Tandläkare sounds more like an orthodontist who works to fix over/under bites, squint teeth etc
For National 5 history my school did a immigration/emigration module that had a focus on the famine, then Irish emigration and then the experiences of the Irish in Scotland
(We also looked at Highland clearances, Scottish emigration as well as other groups like Eastern Europeans and Italians)
Sadly the module was a bit too big (which meant it got boring after a while considering how much time we had to spend on it) and not completely on Irish history but still gave me an insight I didn’t have
I think, like everyone is saying, it depends where they are arriving from
So, for example, if you’re coming to the UK from India or Pakistan you’ll be fine as there’s such a large community of people here from South Asia
Most cities are highly multicultural, I imagine it would be harder in rural areas and smaller towns though
We get the first Monday in May as a bank holiday not the 1st of May
Yep
I'm currently off school and  waiting for a bus and it's extremely busy .
I shower every day but rarely have baths
I have a "shower after work" job rather than a "shower before work" job if that makes sense
Oh man I have been trying to get a shower gel similar to "Erkältungsbad" for ages and it is too expensive to get anything from Germany now,I assume because of Brexit
I badly miss German groceries and some toiletries I loved
Used to get them via Amazon or eBay but now they are extortionate
Sorry for ranting, anyway we shower every other day or so but lockdown kinda made things a bit surreal and routine went out the window
Yeah, I do, but my mother is Spanish, so I just picked it up from her
It's better tha  going at it with a knife, which always pulls the toppings and cheese about and sometimes off, and a good substitute if you don't want a pizza cutter for just one dish
Quite a sensible approach imo
My parents did when I was a kid
I just use a big knife, as its way easier
Augustus, because nobody ever manages to top the guy that started the whole thing
It's also just really impressive to read about how he managed to come out as the winner of the Civil wars, going up against Antonius and Cleopatra and all that drama
I'm also a big fan of Marcus Aurelius
My dad tried to force-feed me *Meditations* when I was younger
I stubbornly refused of course, I was 12 years old, but some of the lessons did manage to get through my skull
> They destroyed our cultures, philosophies and spiritualities
Would it really be "our" cultures
I might be the descendant of ancient Caledonians (and god knows what else), but I don't think I really share anything in common with them besides (maybe) whatver my Y-Chromosome haplogroup is
It's probably because I'm from Scotland, but "our" history (as in a people calling themselves Scots) only really begins after Christianisation really
Saint Columba converted the Picts and Gaels way back in the 6th century already, and Irish monks were renown for their writing and record keeping
Iona Abbey is supposedly the origin place of the Book of Kells (oldest book in Ireland and Britain, you can see it on display in Dublin's Trinity College)
Unlike the Greeks and Italians, our ancestors from antiquity weren't exactly bookworms, so they left us virtually nothing in terms of literary legacy
The oldest accounts of Britain aren't even from Britain, they were written by Phoenician and Greek explorers
I'm an atheist myself, but the Christian church feels a lot more familiar to me than pagan beliefs that have been mostly gone for 1500+ years
My grandmother is a practicing Christian, she's a living connection I have to that part of our history and culture, whereas the only British pagans around today are hippies who call themselves Wiccan
As mentioned, I think this sort of view varies depending on what your cultural background is
Obviously the Greeks can actually look back to their pagan ancestors and actually form a meaningful connection to that past, because it was written down
Aeschylus, Euripides, Aristophanes, Xenophon, Herodotus, etc
are all available in our libraries, but there are no equivalents from ancient Caledonia
>  I'm pro tossing Christians to lions,
St Patrick will remember that
>  I think Scottish history only coincides with Christianity as it was the Goidelic speaking Scots who brought it over from Ireland around the 5th/6th century
The Picts who were already in Caledonia were thought to be Brythonic speaking - ie more like Welsh/Cornish than the Irish (unlike modern Scottish Gaelic)
Yeah there is also that
Our connection with the ancient Picts is severed by the fact that their language was largely replaced by the invaders which we now name ourselves after
> What have the bloody Romans ever done for us
Well
Err
I guess since you are from Ireland, they really did nothing for you
Dundee
Probably unfairly, as it's improved massively, and has had one of the better local governments in Scotland for decades now, and has become something of a cultural hub
But aye, it's Dundee
Shower of minks, sorry, *shewehr ehf mehnks, eh*.
My family were losing it telling me for months I'd get chibbed immediately after leaving the train when I said I was going to Dundee for work
And they're from the most rancid shitehole parts of Glasgow, mind you
Not really for cinema, but in Scotland we have 'silicon glen', which is the home of our tech and gaming industries
Glasgow (approx
3/4 million), Edinburgh (approx
1/2 million), Aberdeen (approx
1/4 million)
**Glasgow**
Traditionally a very industrial city, it suffered a lot from the decline of industry, and rotten local government
It's improved a lot in recent years, and much of it is now a pretty decent place to live, although there remain areas of some pretty horrific poverty, and the lowest life expectancy in Western Europe
Unfortunately Glasgow has given rise to the most tedious of characters, "the professional Glaswegian", who seems to think being from Glasgow is a personality trait, for example, Janey Godley, Tony Roper, Kevin McKenna
Glasgow is neither as bad as "the professional Glaswegian" tells you when they want to gain some sort of hardman status, nor as good as "the professional Glaswegian" tells you when, yet again, they remind you they are in fact from Glasgow
**Edinburgh**
Edinburgh is the political and administrative capital
Edinburgh's old town is one of the most significant tourist draws in Scotland, and the Edinburgh Festival is Scotland's biggest cultural event
This means the city sometimes feels like it's being overwhelmed, and there is sometimes a sense that Edinburgh is not a very Scottish place
Edinburgh is undoubtedly Scotland's prettiest city, although not the only one with architectural merit, as some Edinburghers seem to think
Edinburgh society was long thought of as "the Scots Establishment" and there's still a perception that Scotland is actually run by Edinburgh doctors, lawyers and bankers doing backroom deals in their rugby club or golf club
**Aberdeen**
Aberdeen is far away from the rest of Scotland, and is often dismissed as being too cold, too windy, too grey by people that have never actually been there
It *is* cold, windy and grey, but the presence of two universities in a small city means it can be pretty lively during term-time
Aberdeen is largely focused on the oil industry, and whilst it used to be possible to make a lot of money, it also means Aberdeen is very expensive to live in, and gives poor value for what it offers
Aberdonians also speak a pretty distinct dialect, albeit one with very little media exposure, meaning the rest of the population don't understand what they're saying
Given Aberdeen's relative remoteness, Aberdonians are aware of this, but don't give a shite
Edinburgh: civilised but unfriendly
Glasgow: uncivilised but friendly
Aberdeen: uncivilised and unfriendly
Glasgow 1
8 million
Edinburgh 900k. Aberdeen 490k.
Glasgow - Known for being a bit rough and rundown due to the decline of a lot of traditional industries and failed social housing developments
Making a come back with a lot of Multinational banks, and tech companies building offices in the city, and manufacturing companies are moving back into the city with the new Glasgow Airport Industrial complex being built
People are rough but they are nice, and always happy to help if you ask (they will probably make fun of you at first but it’s just a bit of banter)
Known for being voted murder capital of Europe and nicest people in Europe in the same year
Edinburgh - The Scottish cultural Mecca
Very expensive to live in, tourists everywhere
A lot of banking and government based in the city
It’s one of my favourite cities, and a must go to place if you like architecture
City is jam packed with gothic and Neo classical structures
Known for thinking they are better than everyone else in Scotland
And known for Asking Salt and Sauce rather than salt and vinegar with your fish and chips
Aberdeen - I always compare it to the Texas of Scotland
It’s the largest city in Aberdeenshire and very wealthy
Everyone either works in oil or gas, or works in farming and estate management
People in Aberdeen are actually the one of the richest in the UK, a lot of people are on London or Edinburgh wages but only need to pay Aberdeen prices so have the most money at the end of the month
Very cheap to live in for a major city
It’s best known for Oil, Scottish Tory politicians who tend to be from the city or the Aberdeenshire area, and for the city being made out of granite (sometimes called the granite or silver city)
Aye, if you did one of these for England it would probably be fairer to compare numbers 2-4 really
> "the professional Glaswegian"
Ah, the people whose entire personality is "Ahm fae Glezga"
Yes, I hit respond too early
I've gone back and edited it
There's a reason they're currently filming the Tetris film in Aberdeen
I think because they are scared that judt adds to the;

all that anti vac shit
This is the sort of system I like, I get worried when people (on reddit) say they just want to force all vaccines on people even without the need to do so due to existing heard immunity
Well, also because in English he won't be Charles III also

The film EuroTrip came out in 2004 with some pretty bad depictions of Slovakia
I decided to go to Slovakia in 2005 and absolutely loved it
Glasgow
Despite common depictions you're more likely to get a friendly smile and conversation from someone on the street than a stab in the kidney
I had a great time in Slovakia
Loved it
Bow, Poplar, Stepney Green, Plaistow
These are definitely not tourist hotspots
We generally bring in cakes or sweet treats on our birthdays
Additionally, we do the same when we professionally qualify too
We've been told our company will discourage this practice on return to the office to reduce the risk of passing on illnesses
I like the one between McVities (who produce the Jaffa Cake) and HM Revenue & Customs, simply because you had to have lawyers and court argue over the exact parameters of what is a cake and what is a biscuit and ultimately it became a blurry line where they had to choose which factors and combination of factors makes a cake
[It's just so wonderful and odd, I love it] just a good way to see how weird and layered VAT law is
There used to be and old beggar in Glasgow who stood with one hand out, palm up, to accept money while playing a mouth organ
The “playing” was just suck, blow, repeat without moving the instrument
I always gave him something because I appreciated the extra effort
Cheers can be used to anyone in anyway no matter how many people or how little people
I think it’s mostly confound to the UK, Ireland and parts of Australia and Canada that still have lots of connections to the UK
In school we looked at 3 poems and 3 short stories by modern Scottish writers
Then we just had to learn them and answer questions about them in the exam
By the time I was in School Shakespeare and Robert Burns had been all but pushed out in favour of more modern things
If your teacher didn’t pick poetry you would normally just read a book such as Death of Salesman or Great Gatsby
Water, irn bru, whiskey, haggis, neeps, tatties, clothes, tent, fire and a map
'Fun fivers' are a great idea, except that in the Netherlands there are 'Hier Alleen Pinnen' (i.e. cards only, no cash) signs everywhere
"I'm on my way" by the proclaimers
This song is probably more well know than the national anthem anyway
Historically La Marseillaise was widely used across Europe as a pro-democracy, pro-republican, anti-monarchist and anti-clerical song
The Chartists in the UK in the 1840s had protest songs written to the tune of La Marseillaise
It was sung by Scottish socialists in the 1919 uprising
What about *Nessun Dorma*?
In other countries that's been an iconic symbol of Italy since the 1990 World Cup
I once found myself in Paisley (of all places) quite early one winter's morning
It was one of those still, cold, clear days, when everything is frosty and crisp
All was quiet
Then I heard someone singing Nessun Dorma
It echoed through the town
I followed the sound, until I came across an old Scots-Italian man, sweeping down the street outside his shop
He was just singing to himself as he worked
But he had a voice that - with a bit of training - could have belonged to an opera singer
We are English
Probably that we're English either that or the whole "you're a fake country you don't really exist, just a British province", the first one is mostly based in ignorance which is to a large extent excusable but the second one stings a bit
On holiday in Italy a few years back, the proprietor of the apartment (who couldn't speak much English) asked if we were from "Inghilterra". I acted semi-insulted and said "No, no - Scozia
" and she just waved her hand and said "Ahhh
*is the same*!"
Never been so insulted in my life
Holiday ruined
I once said to someone that I'm from Scotland
Their response
"Scotland
In England
I feel you brother
I don't think we mind being called British, after we are British
We are still part of the U.K.
It's when folk call us English it gets to us
Something inside you starts boiling
You feel the need to take up arms
You feel the need for freedom
Tbh I'd rather not be called British if you don't have to and most Scots are probably somewhat similar
It's not going to create a violent response though
Yes, a lot of people call the U.K England
It is wrong
U.K is made up of four countries, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and England
It's just kinda ignorant calling the whole of the U.K, England
I know a lot of people do it, it just gets to me
> To be fair, she didn't mean to say you are from England
right
Thanks
On an unrelated subject, does anyone know how to remove a 0 star review from TripAdvisor
Yes, some don't like being British, but CURRENTLY we are British
It could all change soon
Ireland is a very unique place
Some feel very strongly about wanting a united, independent Ireland
Others like being part of the U.K.
It's a troubled place sometimes, at least now it's not as bad as it once was
It's religion based in Ireland I think
The independent republic of Ireland is very catholic and Northern Ireland is protestant
If your grandmother is catholic I see why she doesn't like being called British
Wars have been fought for centuries between different Irish groups and parties against the U.K.
I'm not an expert by any case but I know the majority of Catholics in Ireland do not like being called British
Eh i mean kind of
We're British in the same way Puerto Ricans are americans
90% is far too optimistic imo
I'd say a solid third of the population is unsure exactly what the political situation is on the island of Ireland
Amongst a bunch of other things, I get about 1000 Euros a year to use for personal and professional development training
I've used it twice in seven years
One year I used it for private Arabic lessons
Another year I used it to give a paper at a conference in the Caribbean
It's a sweet perk
I have a company phone and the only time I'm expected to be permanently available is the week I'm being paid to be on call
&nbsp;
Although our newest phones have dual sim and my boss was banging on about how great it is, then went onto tell a story about how he was sitting on the beach in Cape Verde and got a work call, tried to tell the guy he was on holiday
then proceeded to be stuck on the phone to the guy for an hour
Yeah no thanks I think I'll keep my work and personal phones separate
Just as well seeing as you don't get parental leave either lol
It can happen on the last and second last trains home from Glasgow
But those are typically the ‘drunk trains’ and everyone is pretty full of it and in the mood for a sing song
I was getting a metro in Madrid a couple of hours after Atletico had won the Europa league
fans were singing chants and banging on the roof
Wild
The accents within the UK are harder for me to understand than Aussie/kiwi/us accents
I worked in England for a while and I'd have to rephrase what I'm saying so they could understand me
>the way Americans and Canadians pronounce tomatoe and aluminium is weird
And *HERBS* my god it makes my toes curl whenever I hear "URBAL TEA"
1314 - Battle of Bannockburn
This defined Scottish identity and independence thereafter with the Declaration of Arbroath (which the US Declaration of Independence is based on) with little subjugation on Scotland by foreign powers and self determination for Scotland
I would’ve argued Culloden was more defining for the country itself considering it’s what caused a purge of Scottish culture
I’d say Bannockburn if you were looking for defining our place on the world stage
Everyone knows us as the freedom guys thanks to that
Arguably it was the decimation of Highlander culture not lowlander as they developed separately
> Literally every person in Britain can tell you about the battle of Hastings and the Normans etc
It's national myth and origin story
Sorry to be *that guy* but it was never taught in my school in Scotland
The only English/pre-British history I was taught was the whole Scotland vs England thing in the middle ages
There are only 4 foods that I can really think of as being “Scottish”, or associated with Scotland: fish & chips, which is a UK wide thing so doesn’t count (and is also delicious); deep fried Mars bars, which are honestly more of a meme than a cultural dish; haggis, which is WAY better than descriptions of it make it sound, and tablet
Tablet is like a kind of hard fudge, and it’s disgustingly sweet
It tastes like someone found a way to bake with only sugar
I'm not a fan of haggis, black pudding, or bacon
Just no keen on them, really don't understand the obsession with bacon
As they say, 'If you want to eat well in the Netherlands, go to Belgium
It’s so fucking strange
People act like going to Nando’s is like some big event like going to the cinema or something, but it’s just cheap junk food
The company doesn’t even pretend it isn’t, but for some reason people are completely obsessed with it
The Dutch can't cook, but they can bake
Baking requires precision, science, calculation - all things the Dutch are good at
Cooking requires flair, passion, love, recklessness - all things the Dutch are bad at
I always associate it with England cause I’ve never had it or seen it, or even seen it on a menu or in shops
Yeah, that's the thing, you can find local cafes or even takeaways with burgers that you'll enjoy just as much in the UK
Five Guys is still good, but it is also a bit extortionate given its competition
But then, that seems to be my experience with the chains, pizza or burger, you tend to get nicer food for as much or less if you just go looking for some good independent takeaways and cafes in your city
Balkan hospitality
"Oh, hi, please, eat with us"
- "oh, that's very kind of you, but I've already eaten"
"Well, just have some bread"
- "you don't have to really, I'm not hungry"
[Granny stare] "**have
some
bread
**"
You're not wrong but I do think that's largely the older generation
Younger folk are generally more aware about mental health issues, in my experience at least
I think it's simply awareness and communication more than anything
Previously we had all that stiff upper lip nonsense, particularly with guys and people are talking more these days
Mental health issues are a lot more common than some people realise; I was actually a missing person for a couple of days so my troubles were *very* public and the amount of people that came forward on social media, either publically or in messenger was unreal
Even some of the most "has their shit together" people were coming forward and telling me about their crippling anxiety or depression, addictions, a surprising amount of bipolar people and all sorts of other conditions
The internet is probably a big factor too
It's a lot easier to find information and relevang help and there's much less of a taboo around therapy and support groups now
Don’t know any outside Glasgow but the People’s Palace, Kelvingrove, and the Riverside Museum are all nice
Highland Folk Museum
It tries to give something of an idea of the actual make up of Highland life, how the houses looked and functioned, and the types of home activities and schooling that functioned up in the north west
It's just a very different feeling museum, being an open air museum
I quite liked it, it's a different approach but it ultimately works by involving you slightly in things, milling oats and cooking them into oatcakes in peat-smoked thatched housing, etc
> , more specifically it was created in Scotland,
Well shit
Here I was, reading this thread, being disgusted by this abominable "cuisine", only to find out we fucking dun it
Well, we are the (first or second
) fattest country in Europe :/
I'm surprised tbh
I imagined somewhere in Latin America would be the second biggest consumer of anime
Dragonball is *huge* in LATAM
>I am jealous
Don't be, Pizza Hut is an abomination
For Sure Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland
The further north you go the more likely people are to consider Norway or Denmark a kind of neighbor too
Malta
Maybe
I don't know, I found them all very neighbourly to a visiting Scot
It did feel kinda like popping next door, much as there were many differences
Give the Isle of Man some love, stuck in amongst us all but so often forgotten
Probably because it's got a similar population to Paisley
Wasn't there also concern about German ports on the channel, given the naval race that had preceded the war, as well
Not wanting German fleets a skip and a hop away from British territory
So, roughly a third of the Highlands
Remember them, or we'll ally and invade the lowlands once more
That's only if you have a pretty strict definition of the highlands
Everything’s a hell of a lot dearer
Also a lot of parts are pretty fancy and posh in Edinburgh
That's usually how the inter-city rivalry jokes from weegies go
Edinburgh is mostly all posh English people
Just that one privately educated English accent everywhere
No Doric, no brummie, no scouse, no weegie, etc
It’s a shite state of affairs and Edinburgh doesn’t really feel Scottish for that reason below surface level
From Finland and your father worked in WRC
Please tell us more
> - Spain- Another solo trip
I climbed Alicante Castle Santa Barbara in the height of summer, then spent ages looking over the gorgeous water and old town drinking an ice cold beer as the sun set
I done that in early May so it wasn't as warm as it is in the height of summer
Still had cracking views though when I got to the top
And cheap beer
[The ice cream van drivers] were at it in the '80s!
That might me the most Scottish thing I have seen today
I’m not gonna answer for the UK, cause yall already know the answer, but from Scotland specifically probably Orkney and Shetland
They used to be Norwegian territories, and still maintain a decidedly Nordic identity
I don’t think successions is at all likely, but of everywhere in Scotland they are the most likely
I would say Shetland
Different history and geographically separated
Probably Shetland, I don't know much at all about the place but they do seem to almost feel more Nordic than Scottish at times
Also Glasgow, quite a few Glaswegians claim everything Scottish as specifically Glaswegian for some reason so they probably feel like their own unique place already
Except the last time anyone asked less than 10% of the population wanted to secede
Seems vanishingly unlikely
London would yeet itself out of England if it could mate, gie yersel peace
I'm curious as to how Scotland wouldn't be able to afford independence
We're no poorer than Ireland
My dad comes from Orkney so I’ve visited it a lot, and I swear Magnus is by far the most common mans name there
It’s weird
You might also find [the flag] a bit familiar
> Although if I lived in Northumberland/Cumbria I'd be tempted to try and join an independent Scotland
What about the Northern Independence Party, they're a great bunch of lads
Also, their logo has a whippet in it
There was a huge shift in votes to the SNP in Shetland recently, suggesting there isn't much support for breaking from Edinburgh
No, I’ve never seen stray dogs in the UK
A lone dog running around the streets would be assumed as lost and would be reported as such
I don't think so there are a few nieberhood cats that "roam free" . I live in a built up area so I'm not sure but I think in the country (Highlands and Islands) it would be deer you need to watch for
Surely that would simply be Lands End in Cornwall
Certainly black ink
Many official forms and documents specify that they must be completed in black ink only
I work in the national health service and it’s black ink only for everything
You do occasionally get forms here that specify blue ink, probably for the same reason I imagine
When we get independence, I’m sure it’ll be our official ink ;)
> speech-to-text
No chance with my accent
Did you go to a posh school or is this an English thing in general
At my school they were happy enough as long as we actually brought something to write with
I believe only a lawyer can notorise a document in Scotland
I know it's a bit more open in the States based on what I've seen in films and the telly
The thing is, if I'm speaking to non-native English speakers they'll understand me 99% of the time with my accent (I switch to using standard English words obviously), but in the south of England there's a very high chance of "u wot, m8
" as soon as I open my mouth
I've had non-Scots describe my accent as "neutral Scottish" (i.e. I'm from somewhere in the middle that's not quite as well known
) so I've no idea if that helps
For very young children you do see it but it's really just an excuse for the adults to get together
Not really
We did study Scots a bit through Robert Burns and there's a bit of a debate whether Scots is a language in itself or a dialect of English
We did study some dialects of Spanish when learning that language though like Catalan
In Scotland it's common to study Robert Burns' poems around Burns night or St Andrews day (think Auld Lang Syne)
But I'd say the Scots dialect is taken a lot less seriously than the Gaelic language (see also the Scots Wikipedia debacle)
Gaelic is offered as a subject in many schools, especially on the west coast
There are also a fair number of schools which teach entirely in Gaelic (which means a fair chunk of the curriculum including exams are offered in the language
Also, our dialects aren't actually that difficult for the most part to pick up, they usually don't vary too dramatically
See more people struggling with the heavier accents than the dialect, which you just pick up bit by bit of you talk and travel to people
Do you have a sort of "Standard" Irish in the way that we've got Mid-Minch Gaelic as a sort of "BBC Gàidhlig"?
Weirdly enough, my parents did Burns at school for a week in January
and then the rest of the year they went back to getting the strap if they spoke Scots in class
I'm too young to have got the belt but I also went through the whole "Scots is forbidden except one week in January in Primary 7".
In my case giving us a row or ridiculing us
I remember my primary 6 teacher standing a boy at the front of the class and trying to make everyone laugh at him
High school was a bit more tolerant on the whole
Previous generations would have had it worse though, and it’s been horrific for Gaelic speakers
Scots was never outright banned - the people that took against it so would never admit it *existed*.
Children in schools in my parents generation would be beaten by teachers with a leather strap called a 'Lochgelly' for speaking Scots, because it was seen as speaking 'bad english' and the language of the gutter
It's worth noting that this wasn't really an English imposition on Scotland, rather a British classist imposition by Scots on other Scots
Whilst it's arguable that in a school where the language of instruction is english, teachers should not be addressed in Scots, being overheard speaking Scots to one another in class often got a sharp word from the teacher
I speak Scots and consider it my first language but rarely read/write it if that makes sense
I've also been learning Gaelic recently, although I don't live in a recently Gaelic speaking area
We can't really blame anyone else for how we've treated Scottish Gaelic over here, anti-Gaelic attitudes pre-date the Act of Union so it's all down to us in our case
Walkers cheese and onion crisps with butter
Butter, choped pork, salt and pepper, cheddar, red sauce
White bread, buttered, Corned beef
Somebody mentioned Bifana, I had one at [this place] in Porto, and oh my God I think it was the best sandwich I've ever eaten in my life
This is the only right answer
Top tip, mix Cheesy Wotsits and smoky bacon crisps, it's food of the gods

Life-changing mate honest
There's a decent number of Scottish wide institutions based in Glasgow which makes sense given it's bigger than the capital
In the UK as a whole they're trying to move things North a bit particularly to Manchester and Birmingham
&#x200B;
EDIT: Also to keep the nuclear missiles safe and away from population they moved it away from England and sat almost all of the UK's nuclear command and arsenal right next to the biggest city in Scotland
Don't know how to compare to US, but would think similarish to how London is a sort of gaping blackhole in the UK that sucks everything into it
Except France doesn't have the minor decentralising effects of being made of the four home nations
They are very heavily centralised
"Iphigenie auf Tauris" (Iphigenia in Tauris) from Goethe
I just found it so boring
The Cone Gatherers by Robin Jenkins, I don't even think it's a bad book, I just hated reading it
Nah, Abi '14
Yeah I never knew about that connection
The Italians did not speak with their hands
Very dissatisfied
I've been to Germany a few times and the stereotype "they will reply in English even if you try German" held true in most cases
except for when it didn't. My husband and I both have some competence with German but not enough to sustain a proper conversation beyond greetings, ordering stuff and generally being polite
But we also apparently have enough competence that people will talk back to us in German, sometimes using slang or turns of phrase we're not used to
But overall we (usually) understand what is being said to us but can't think of a reply fast enough
it has led to some pretty embarrassing times on our part where we end up giving up and reverting to English
Lake Garda wasn't too bad for driving imo
Some other tourists freaked out around the lake because of the twisty nature of the roads but other than getting stuck behind a tractor it was ok
Did not drive in Rome but don't know why anyone would as even wandering around as a pedestrian it was like a symphony of angry horns and terrible options for parking
Just spent two weeks in Portugal with a week of car hire and would recommend for all your insane driver needs
They've got extreme tailgating to the point of trying to go into the central reservation, they've got dangerous overtakes, they've got squeezing in front of someone without an indicator after a potentially dangerous overtake
I'm also fairly sure the speed limit doesn't actually exist because it felt like everyone not in a hire car, HGV or car that is almost as old as me was doing at least 150 km/h. We were often doing a little over 120 km/h and it still wasn't enough for some people
The mutes must also have double arm amputations
We had to drive in and out of Verona a couple of times and that alone was worse than around the lake
We didn't keep the car when we headed to Florence the week afterward, and like Rome that's another place where I feel a tourist would need to be out of their mind to try and drive around it
Three mass shootings in the last 24 hours
I mean seriously
There's "Muh guns" but there's also clearly some serious mental health problems going on and people have to decide if they can afford to be treated
Can you even imagine lying at the side of the road after an accident, asking people not to phone an ambulance because you can't afford it
Fucking bizarre mindset to think that's acceptable
Low key bragging that you speak 3 languages
To many English speakers like myself speaking 3 languages seems quite impressive
I wish I had a better French teacher in elementary school
We didn't have a choice with French, as I did my schooling in Canada
Unfortunately all the teachers that we had throughout primary school were absolutely terrible, one of them didn't even speak French
I did a German course in secondary but I definitely can't speak German
I definitely have a better understanding of German than French though and I'm trying to learn German again now
Yeah I know it's ridiculous
He also didn't know if he was supposed to be teaching Quebecois or Parisian French
Finnish if it counts
If not Danish, as a celt I'm obligated to appreciate anyone who speaks with a potato in their mouth at all times
YES
BBC Scotland, essentially a branch of the BBC just for us
I always forget when to place a comma
I'm still not completely sure
I'm speaking on more of a dialect and I don't know how much my answer is gonna fit but I'd say the fact that it's been watered down a lot and sort of seems like it's still fading away
I remember once my cousin was up with his son and he said something about his "jaikit" (jacket) and his son had no clue what he was talking about
It's little things like that which is sad to see
I've noticed as well my great Auntie who's 95 uses other words that I don't hear at all anymore other than from her like and other right old people "ingin" for onion or "gan" for go and stuff like that
I guess maybe in other areas these words might be more prevalent but it's still a kind of worrying thought in case Scots is just gonna continue getting watered down
It's already looked on as slang/lower class speech by upper class people
I hate english cause even I can’t speak English sometimes when I’m ranting
It really needs to be taught in schools and maybe a Language Academy to make words and spellings standard, but then there is so much dialect variety it would be hard (and not right) to make a ‘Standard Scots’ that would be taught in schools
Also Gaelic shouldn’t be being promoted before Scots in the lowlands
Eh, I'd say the promotion of Gaelic is warranted since that's doing a lot worse than Scots but I see what you mean
I also kind of suspect it might be due to American media and all that because I've noticed one of my nieces says "tomorrow" like "tomarrow" and Americans tend to kind of say it like that, so if it can affect kids here like that then it wouldn't surprise me if it affects the vocabulary they use/don't use
That's probably a fair sized stretch as well but oh well
I agree Gaelic should be promoted as a national language and espically in the highlands, but Scots should be promoted more than Gaelic in the lowlands
I think everywhere is getting American-ised
A lot of my friends using things like ‘trash’ all the time
Gaelio-Celtic Union
Scotland and England
Pretty chill, I think
England: No thanks
We've been playing that game for 312 years
Ireland: It might take a bit of constitutional wrangling to sort out the details, but it would be fine
Just over 300 hundred years of Union
Starting to fray a bit, mind
Just do it now please
No offence but I doubt you guys would treat us any better than the English
The Scots basically already own your islands haha
Just the thought of that makes me feel ill
The pizza, I'm used to being ignored
Thank you
I know the answer to this
Non lo so
My dad had Sibelius' *Finlandia* on vinyl, and the photo on the cover showed very mountainous scenery, so I assumed that Finland must also be mountainous
I've no idea where the photo on the cover was of, but it certainly wasn't Finland
Edit: this is the cover
Whilst Finland does have isolated mountains in the North, they don't look like the ones in the photo
I used to think that people in Switzerland spoke Swiss and that Belgian people spoke Belgian
When my sister was younger, if she didn’t know where a place was she decided it was a city in Russia
I don’t really know why
Serbia - city in Russia (close to Siberia so understandable for her age)
Vietnam - city in Russia
Cuba - city in Russia
Bosnia & Herzegovina - cities in Russia
Malta - city in Russia
Moscow - country near Russia
Oh my god
Are you me
I was *utterly* ***convinced*** of the same thing
> England, Soctland and Wales were independent countries
Not yet ;)
> I thought the UK was an evil person who was running for irish president
Tbh, for a while this was true
Well theres the glenfinnan viaduct that's cool, any number of castles but I'd go Doune cz monty python
theres loch ness and loch lomond those guys are cool
And probably one which is an incredible marvel of engineering but
well it's just a bit fucking dull
The Falkirk wheel
I used to think that sign-language was the some, until I was told that every country has a different sign language
Which still feels like a missed opportunity to me
Finland isn't Scandinavian, it's Nordic
Finland is mostly rolling forest, interrupted by lakes, and the odd moraine ridge, with isolated low mountains in the North
That's a very logical trap
My tooth fairy trap involved lots of string and a weight that would wake me up to "see her" when she tried to take it so I could ask for double since it was an "adult tooth" that fell out and it should be worth more for it, since I'd never get a replacement for it
*(For some reason my right I-tooth fell out as soon as it came in, but my mother never believed that it was an adult tooth until the dentist asked why it was missing a couple of years later)*
Stupidly I told my mother all about it and she "helped" me set it up
Such that she just brought scissors and cut the string so I didn't notice
The Kelpies are smashin right enough
But the duke was a dunt and Nessie isnt a monument shes a sweet old girl who jist wants some privacy

The UK Supreme Court has 12 judges
An odd number of judges have to hear each case, so the maximum to sit on one case is 11 - which has only happened twice
Scotland has two Supreme Courts - the Court of Session for civil law and the High Court of  Justiciary for criminal law
Judges for these Courts are known as Senators of the College of Justice and there are currently 36 of them
It’s a great building, isn’t it
Did you see the advocates walking around Parliament Hall
Hope you enjoyed your moot - did you get a Senator to preside
They’re usually very open to do that for moots - especially international ones
You’re quite right that the Supreme Court is the final court of appeal for civil matters in Scotland
But the Court of Session and High Court of Justiciary are known as the Supreme Courts in Scotland - see, for example, the Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service [website ]
I know this doesn't really fit but I thought some people might find it interesting;
in some areas we sometimes say "two" exactly how it's spelt, like "twoh". I've noticed though (at least for my area) it's never if you're counting or something, it's only if you're saying something like "the two of them". It's not that common though unfortunately
I also think some areas might say "twa" but I'm not too sure about that
edit: The "oh" in "twoh" is more pronounced like "aw"
During my many years of learning French at school in the UK I hated the whole "quatre-vingt-dice-neuf" nonesnese
It was just super counter-intuitive to me
I eventually just looked it up online and started using the "alternative" numberings of huitante etc
I memorised a phrase in French explaining to the teacher about how I thought it was a more eloquent way of describing numbers for oral tests, and since it was considered like "American vs British English" differences to her, she let me get away with it
Phew
Edinburgh Castle, still used as a military base and a tourist attraction

Lewis Capaldi, Susan Boyle, Calvin Harris
Lewis Capaldi is rocking the charts at the moment around the world
I think AleStorm should be heard more often, they invented pirate metal
I would walk 500 miles and I would walk 500 more
The joy formidable - a fantastic welsh 3 piece that do a lot of their work in Welsh
CHVRCHES are Scottish
Red Hot Chilli *Pipers*!
Well, you learn something new everyday
Don't know *why* I didn't know it, mind you
They got famous from doing piping and Scottish covers of famous songs, so the name is a reference to the Peppers
They're pretty famous outside of Scotland now
I assume that's an accent thing
A lot of people who aren't used to some Scottish accents think they sound very Irish
Just about the same as Spain
Have small talk like that with cashier workers, bus drivers, taxi drivers etc
I used to love that as a kid
Alles Klar in Germany just means Did you get that / any questions
In Austria it was usually dismissive, somewhere between Did I fucking stutter and is anyone here so stupid that I have to spell it out and draw a diagram
Caveat: I have left Austria a long time ago and the language seems to have gotten much more Germanised
Giving out
\- Ireland: berate
\- Scotland: express willingness to have sex
&#x200B;
Fine piece/fancy piece
\- USA: attractive woman, possibly a mistress
\- Scotland: a small cake or piece of confectionery
We'd use "rare day" to mean good weather
Presumably because good weather is rare in Scotland
In this case, it's not so much a phrase as "something that would be understood to mean
Not really sure tbh, I don't have numbers
I rarely meet anyone who can actually grow a good one
Slow start, hint at good performances in the second half of matches
Go out in the first round and be left to rue missed opportunities
Scotland fans have had all optimism beaten out of them, despite the national euphoria of finally qualifying
This is a marked change from the 60s, 70s and 80s when we always assumed we'd win the thing, despite all evidence to the contrary
(The days of "premature-jock-elation" are over)
No expectation really
Hopefully beat the English and hold our own
I think we can get out of the Group
Haha, funny joke
About as well as they always do; lot of mediocre games, one or two crowning moments of glory to make us hopeful again
Then bombing out in spectacular fashion, leaving us to support our fallback of ABE
Most Austrians I’ve seen talk about their NT seem to be really negative, I mean I’ve seen some say they think we’ll finish above you in the WCQ haha
Me and you are in the same boat mate
Although I’d say our squad is a little stronger haha ;)
Good luck to North Macedonia this summer
Mbappe, Müller and Ronaldo will all retire when they see Gulasci
This is a bit unrelated but how is Shaun Maloney thought of in Belgium
He has been heavily linked with the Celtic job and the Aberdeen job before they got a new manager
Martinez is one of the favourites for the Celtic job too lol
I like Isak, Kulusevski, Ibra etc
but I really want to see Larsson play for Sweden
He’s doing great for Spartak but I heard Janne Anderson doesn’t really like him - any reason for that
Seen a couple comments like this
I genuinely don’t even know of any other European Championships other than the football ones
Slovenia didn’t qualify but why do you want them to do badly
If you don’t like football fine but it brings joy to so many
> if we win a game in our group I will be happy
That will be a challenge - Ireland didn't qualify
There's no way we're making it out of the group stages - Scotland are the weakest team in that group, and we're not playing very well at all at the moment
Would be one of the best days of my life if we beat England
Last time we played we dominated them but Harry Kane scored 90th minute to knock us out the World Cup qualifiers
Thanks for the well wishes
Hope Sweden do well too
Have to want Henke’s country to do well
Last game we played in European Championship competition we won btw
[should have won 4-0 too]
Football
Iceland missed out this year and OP of the comment doesn’t need to worry as Scotland will be knocking them out
Yeah Sweden have a really great team I just want to see him called up because he’s the King’s son hahaha
Thanks for the info
You’ll need to hope Australia make the 2022 World Cup because Ireland aren’t going to that either haha
Is the football one really not the one that comes to mind first tho seriously
All those combined probably aren’t half as popular as the football one
I never even knew the rugby was on, only found out when our (Celtic) CEO tweeted about it and I don’t know anyone who likes rugby so I kinda missed that one haha
I’d take going out if we beat you and you came home with us
Pretty sure the European Championships in football has a far bigger audience than all those mate
You didn’t specify in Austria there mate
Yeah fair enough I couldn’t tell you what ones most viewed in the one above’s country but football is Austria’s national sport so it’s a decent guess
You were replying about my reply to an Austrian flair but
I was just surprised people didn’t realise OP was talking about the football one because it’s a European wide sub and I thought most people would see the football European Championship as the biggest and most popular one, that is all
No I wasn’t surprised that there are European Championships outside of football, but I didn’t know about any of them other than the basketball one lol and that’s only because I like basketball which is very very rare in my country
German for sure
Scots Gaelic
I like Spanish, but that might just be purely due to hearing family speak it for most of my life
You hear it a lot walking around Edinburgh, Manchester, etc, so it's always quite pleasant when you hear snippets
I liked Italy
Went with a friend, she knew French and Spanish and a few Italian words, people just took it as a strange dialect, was wonderful
Great country, seemed very relaxed about language
I don't speak Scots Gaelic
Just English and Scots (if you consider it a languge)
Edward the 1st of England
He’s celebrated as bringing Wales under the control of the English crown and being a very powerful/successful ruler
He was known as the “hammer of Scots” so you can guess how he’s viewed here
Well yeah
Millions starved in labour camps in the USSR
Thatcher stole the lunches  of striking miners
There's a lot in common
What angle should I take here
I'm a native English speaker so we need to be worried if it gets so popular it disappears
Gaelic has going petting strong as a second language we are fine
To the point we have to invent Gaelic names for road signs that historically never spoke it
There's already a few dead tounges I can't even remember the name of as despite being native arent english or garlic
At least your education system bothers telling you it even exists
Part of the problem with Scottish Gaelic (and something similar with Irish, although I am not familiar with Irish history) is the fact that it was forced out during the highland clearances
It was [outlawed in 1616] and after the Jacobite rebellion in 1745 it was pushed down further
Banning of kilts, Gaelic, anything “Scottish” caused a huge decline in every part of our culture
I agree the Scottish government hasn’t done a good job of reintroducing it, but the language hasn’t been naturally replaced by English, it was forced out to be replaced, which is part of the cause of its decline
They're responsible for the now worldwide fashion of men wearing material draped around the neck on formal occasions
This one for sure
I'm a little worried about the future, the present is the best time yet to be alive but I'd probably choose to be born in the 1950s so I'd see the present day, not have to worry too much about the future and still live in a pretty good time
Well I the Yu-Gi-Oh thing instead of guns people just pointed at people
Depends
Sometimes Western Europe, sometimes Northern Europe
I’m sure if you asked Shetland they’d try to say they’re Scandinavian
Although there’s also the group that would claim Britain and Ireland are a unique region of Europe
Western Europe, British isles, And debatably Northern Europe
I mean, I’m pretty sure we’re further north than Denmark so I think that qualifies as Northern Europe
The question of whether we are part of Europe at all is, sadly, still being debated
The islands which some people do refer to as "British Isles" and some people do not refer to as "British Isles".
I believe they are referring to brexit, but even outside of that the British isles are sometimes not considered European
I’ve actually had a few people on this site tell me I’m not European, which is mildly frustrating
Well, we are being dragged out of the EU against our will
So as a Scottish European it's a bit of a sore point

I am currently living in Korea, so you must always take your shoes off 100% of the time in a house
You also take them off in lots of restaurants, offices and schools
Back in Scotland, I operated the same rule
No shoes inside, only slippers/socks/bare feet
It makes cleaning much less work and keeps carpets/rugs in better condition
Rolls on Square sausage seem to blow visitors minds
Brummie mate : wtf is that
Me : Roll on sausage (stuffing my gob)
Brummie: it's square
Me: aye square sausage
Brummie : is it haggis
I lost it at that point and got him one, he ended up going home with 2 bricks of it
Oh sorry Brummies are from Birmingham

If you are ever at a nightclub and want to know how many Scots are there request that, they will all be up stamping their feet
Easy

It's pretty cheesy but Scots can't help get teary eyed at it
I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles) by the Proclaimers
(Scotland) The Bonnie Banks o Loch Lomond is an extremely popular song in Scotland
Loch Lomond is our biggest loch and is regarded with great affection by many
The song's most popular rendition is probably that by Runrig, which has a chorus in Gaelic (ho mo leannan bhoideach) added to it:
It's also often sung at the football:
- [Auld Lang Syne]
- [Scotland the Brave]
Loch Lomond
An absolute belter of a way to end a Wedding Party
Loch Lomond for sure, aside from being a beautifully descriptive song, I used to work at a wedding venue and at the end of every single wedding, what’s left of the party -or who was left standing- gather into a circle around the dance floor, link arms and sing and sway along while the bride and groom dance in the middle, it’s the most Scottish thing, especially because no one ever has to be instructed on what to do, you hear the opening of the song and just immediately find someone to link arms with
Dougie McClean's Caledonia
He said besides our national anthem
It's worth pointing out that those are primarily songs with meaning to English people, there are not really any songs of this type that are shared across the whole UK any more
>the ketchup song
Taking me back to my Primary 3 school disco with that
It's a Scottish band who sing in a Scottish accent
Inside Scotland people usually live it just because it's a great tune, but Scottish people in particular I've found get weirdly patriotic for Scottish stuff when we leave
Is it all our added swearing
Yeah, but probably pre 1950s or WW2: very much regarded as an imperialistic sounding song these days
No problem
Should I stay or should I go
It's an unusual food that most people I think have tried once or twice
Mostly in Scotland duck and venison are seen as fine dining dishes (if it's not some kind of duck from a chinese take away anyway)
Rabbit is less common but I've had it, not frequently or recently or but I know where I can get some if I get a craving
I don't think I'd be surprised to hear that there is some dish or something including rabbit, but I don't think I've ever heard of or seen anyone eating rabbit before
Scots has been slowly getting watered down for probably hundreds of years and it looks like it's still actively fading between the generations, at least with some kids anyway
Honestly I don't know how it's looked at now in schools but in school you'd get taught that some words aren't the "right" words like it's just bad English but it's actually just Scots words
The one that surprised me the most was jamp for jumped, because I've always genuinely thought that was just an actual one where jamp was never a word and just invented by kids trying to understand language (sort of like how some might come up with "gived" instead of "gave") and for some reason stuck with some people into adulthood, but as it turns out it's just a Scots word
It's even the tiny subtle things like that which are contributing to Scots fading away
I feel like constant American media consumption isn't helping at all either, my niece started calling a bin a "trash can" and my other one goes about saying tomorrow like tomarrow like an American
Still in a Scottish accent but it's that letter change of the 2nd o
edit since I forgot something to include: my youngest niece is at the age where she's just getting the hang of reading and when she was sounding out the letters of a word, everytime she came across an r she would do that flat r instead of a tapped one, and I remember when I was learning how to read we got taught that r sounded like "rih" so the tapped noise was still there, but now it's just "rrrr"
edit again: there are efforts done by people to try and preserve Scots, but some of it's done by upper class people who don't even speak that way and they go about trying to push a way that no one's even spoken for probably like a hundred years *at least* and most of it just doesn't sound natural at all, it's sort of like saying you can speak English but then go and start speaking middle English
Gaelic is still spoken in parts of the Highlands and in some islands, it's not really a thing in the Lowlands any more (other than learners and migrants)
In some of these areas I believe the number of young speakers is actually starting to increase due to Gaelic Medium Education
There are a variety of Gaelic dialects but Mid-Minch Gaelic is becoming a sort of "standard Gaelic".
In the Lowlands, Shetland, and Orkney a lot of people speak their own dialects of Scots, and even more people speak some sort of hybrid English/Scots depending on the context
Young people do still speak it but as is usually the case with these things it's becoming less common and the local dialects are becoming less distinct
Edit: I forgot about the Travellers, I believe some of them have their own language
Scottish gaelic is spoke in the highlands and islands
Well throughout the whole of the highlands it still seems a bit uncommon
From what I can tell just looking at a map on the percentages, there aren't any parts of the highlands where more than 50% of the population speaks it
> I have a question for you
Just how important are these languages for the Scottish culture and identity
For Scots I guess it's fair to say it's a fair deal in culture/identity in working class areas, not so much so in middle/upper class, they'll just put it down as being nothing more than slang
Even some people in the working class areas do that too, but at least slang they're proud of if you get what I mean
To be fair though it is an unformal way of talking so it would fit in with the definition of slang
With r/ScottishPeopleTwitter becoming popular though there are people who don't even talk this way that go about trying to online and it just doesn't feel right at all
As for Gaelic it's not really got an impact on as much people at all, certainly not for me anyway so I can't really effectively speak on it
Only like 1% of the population speaks it anymore and they're all mostly in the islands/highlands, mostly the islands
It's one of those things I guess where if we can preserve it we should, but I'm not exactly shitting my pants at it or anything
Culturally it's got nothing to do with most of us but that doesn't mean we should leave out the small percentage where it does
The government has made an effort to revive it by making it standard for gaelic to be on things like police cars/ambulances (just "police" or "ambulance" in gaelic) and I'm pretty sure it's getting taught all around Scotland now too, I could be wrong on that though but at least more widespread than what it used to be
To the best of my knowledge every Gaelic speaker is fluent in English
To hear them speak English you wouldn't necessarily know that they were even Gaelic speakers other than the occasional Gaelic loanword or slightly different grammar from standard English
The loanwords and grammar are also found in non Gaelic speakers who live in those areas
Scots can be a strange one
Many speakers would deny it's even a thing, I suspect those people would be less likely to code switch than someone who recognises the language as something different if that makes sense
I'm a Scots speaker myself but I'll switch to standard English depending on who I'm speaking to
My entire schooling has been in English after all
No idea about the travellers to be honest
At least three separate groups (although I've probably missed some), Romani/Gypsies, Irish Travellers, Highland/Scottish Travellers
I think there's a regional element to Scots being seen as distinct
I'm from Aberdeenshire and most people there would acknowledge Doric as being a clearly defined dialect and most people would code-switch to some extent, whereas say a Glaswegian dialect is often treated more as just the way you speak and not as its own thing
Correct
There's very little Scots influence out that way at all except Campbeltown, but I believe that's due to plantation of lowlanders a few centuries ago (this seems to be a recurring thing
It's a weird one eh
It's not even a unionist vs nationalist thing necessarily, you get both mentalities on both sides
keep in mind though, *some* scots that gets pushed is the type of scots that isn't even spoken anymore, only by people who actively learn it
Out of curiosity how would they pronounce it
To throw a spanner in the works there's "aw-ven" from some Fifers and Taysiders
While everyone is aware of William Wallace, thanks to a certain movie, it was actually Robert the Bruce who won Scotland's independence
> But no king could be picked because of trivial issues like which flags to use
That's quite funny
Imagine declining the throne of France because you can't be arsed to accept the tricolour as a flag
Well, if you believe in violent revolution being a necessity, that entails killing your opponents as well
> A communist revolution doesn't wish harm on people
But when you define anyone who doesn't tow the party line as "reactionary bourgeois fascists", it's kind of hard to believe that
Not even other Communists are spared; Trotsky got the Ice pick from Stalin, Mao accused the Soviets of being revisionists, Tito nearly got Ice-picked by Stalin
> When have I ever done that
Perhaps you personally haven't, but it's not a secret that historically speaking, Communist revolutionaries have a habit of doing that
Trotsky, Lenin, Castro, etc
were not shy about saying it either, they were very vocal about denouncing their opponents as "Fascists".
>They thought it necessary in the moment
Well there lies the problem
"Oh killing thousands of people was just necessary, woe is me, I didn't want to execute them but they just so happened to disagree with me
" The death penalty is already barbaric in itself, even if it's used against "those who deserve it" (e.g. someone like Anders Breivik)
Trying to justify its use against people for disagreeing politically is pure savagery
>And to be quite honest, you would never use the same standards for capitalist systems, anyway
If deadly infighting in historical expressions was a black mark against an ideology for you, you wouldn't be able to defend capitalism for even a second
I don't have to worry about Angela Merkel or Macron hiring hitmen to eliminate the leaders of the SPD or the PS
Honestly, Glasgow has a pretty good foreign food scene
Italian, Chinese and Indian are probably the three most popular and that is likely as a result of those nationalities being our biggest ex-pat communities in 20th century
Sushi and Ramen are becoming more popular
We have a fair few Spanish and Greek restaurants
A few Turkish restaurants have popped up in the last few months (and the one I ate in on Saturday was fantastic)
We have a couple of Mexican restaurants (one of which is amazing) and a couple of Vietnamese and Thai places too
Glasgow's international food scene is really quite good, which may surprise some of you
Lots of Japanese, Chinese and about a million Indian take aways
Also got some Jamaican foods which are class
it's probably all gonna be in some form of a chippy
We have loads of continental European food like Italian
But we have some Caribbean food mostly brought over from when loads of people came here after WW2 as the UK needed people to help rebuild after the war, so a lot of colonial people left the home countries like Jamaica and India and brought there great food to bless us with

A more modern translation, but with minimal changes to the original translation, would simply swap ‘where’ and ‘there’. It still sounds old fashioned, but not archaic
(It’s a slightly different sense of the word ‘there’, it’s not just a change of word order)
Quite Positive
We knew we would have England (should we qualify)
We have beaten Croatia twice in recent years and the Czech Republic are a good side but are certainly beatable at Hampden
Knowing Scotland we'll fuck it up by managing to lose to Norway in the PO Final
Given that we could have had France and Portugal but instead have Czechia and Croatia, it's not as bad as it could have been
A moot point though, as I don't think we'll get past the winner of the Serbia/Norway playoff to even qualify
If we qualify (and it's a massive IF) we're getting pumped rotten in that group
2nd play off is gonna be tough
They never actually flipped a coin
Wembley was decided because of a) revenue reasons and b) England had qualified automatically
If that happens we qualify automatically
But don't get any home games
Please help
Yes
Scotland's politics are too far removed from England's, and we're being pulled along into Tory governments that we don't vote for time and again
Now, we're being pulled out of the EU without our consent
Independence is the only option
We had a referendum in 2014 and 45% voted for Scottish independence
I would hazard a guess that this number has not dropped in five years, especially considering what has happened with the Conservative governments, Brexit and Boris being PM
Bluntly, I’m too tired with it all
I would still vote Yes but I genuinely cannot be fucked with another 2/3 years of constant campaigning, debates, arguments
Let Brexit happen, give it a decade or so and go from there
This is the final stage in the unravelling of the once-mighty British Empire
We never really completed the transition, institutionally and psychologically, from global imperial power to normal European country
Brexit is, above all, an expression of the older generation's bewilderment at the relative decline in British power and prestige (as well as relative living standards) over their lifetimes
There's a lot of anger, fear and confusion behind it
This is all being deliberately manipulated by a small but very powerful clique of oligarchic libertarians who see it as an opportunity to finally dismantle what's left of the welfare state, workers' rights and environmental protections
The people who are pushing Brexit from the top and the people who are supporting it from the bottom have fundamentally different interests; when the people at the bottom realise how much they've been played, and that nineteenth century British greatness is not coming back - but nineteenth century slums and sweatshops are - there will be hell to pay
In the process of all this, the British 'unwritten constitution' (ok, parts of it are written down, but it is not codified into a supreme and fundamental law of the sort that every other European country has) has shown its weakness
It really offers no protection against a government determined to push its boundaries and exploit its many quirks and loopholes
We've had policy differences for a long time - that's a normal part of democratic politics - but for the first time since the British Civil Wars we now have fundamental disagreements about the legitimacy of the decision-making rules themselves
This is not just a political, economic and diplomatic crisis - leaving Britain weaker, poorer and more isolated than ever before - it is also a profound constitutional crisis
Discourse has also been poisoned
The tension between Leavers and Remainers has reached the point is no longer than of fellow-citizens having a civil disagreement over alternative conceptions of the public good, but a stand-off between enemies
Judges have been attacked as 'enemies of the people'. MPs have been assassinated and threatened
All the things Britain was famous for - civility, common sense, moderation, pragmatism - have fallen apart
Scotland voted in 2014 to stay in the UK
Promises were made at the time: that we would remain in the EU, and that Scotland would have greater autonomy within the UK
Both promises have been broken
The Brexit process has been accompanied by the ignoring and sidelining of the Scottish Government and Scottish Parliament
When Scotland voted by a clear majority in 2016 to remain in the EU, but is being taken out against its will, and against the terms promised in 2014, this is no longer a 'partnership of equals'. It feels increasingly like being a captive country tied to a UK that has lost its mind
Scottish independence is now a necessary and I think inevitable outcome
The only question is whether we get out before the damage is done or afterwards
A small country like Scotland always has to ally itself and share powers with others
In the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, we chose to do that through the framework of the British empire; in the 21st, our only hope is the European Union
I cannot speak about Northern Ireland - it has its own, distinct issues with which I am not well acquainted
But it would not surprise me if we also see a United Ireland at the end of this
Which leaves England and Wales
And I'm not so sure about Wales
I fear for England
I think they (I'm speaking here as a Scot) will see a sort of English Francoism - a nationalist, authoritarian, conservative regime; after that, perhaps, there will be less hubris, the ghosts of empire will be laid to rest, and England can finally become a normal European country too
But that involves at least a generation of pain and misery
> I believe the UK is much stronger together
What does this *mean*? Like, I don't get what the point of such a statement is, how it impacts upon our economies or societies or every day life
This may seem overly harsh, but I'm trying to be genuine here, it just sounds like vacuous politician speak
What does it mean to you
People from other parts of the UK already need to pay fees to study in Scottish universities
I don't see that changing
Yeah proper raging tbh
Its cause of the unionists who would have normally voted lab/ld voting con because they're the strongest party
Very unlikely that Johnson will accept it, and after the last referendum, Sturgeon will only call it if she's sure she'll win
I'd give it some time, perhaps until a labour government gains power in Westminster
You are certainly correct
We were told time after time that leaving the UK meant leaving the EU
The only way to stay in the EU was to vote No
So we did
Two years later Scotland voted to stay in Europe
And the rest of the UK took us out
You cannot write this
Yes me too
It was 45% yes last time
I cannot see that figure getting lower over time
I do think that if and when we get another vote independence will happen
Yeah, when the GERS/GERW figures came out there were a number of posts along those lines
Yes
A lot of Scottish trade is with England - but much of it simply appears that way because it goes through England on its way to the EU
An independent Scotland in the EU would need bigger port facilities to import and export directly to the rest of the EU, bypassing England
So does everyone in the UK except England and Wales
I think it's plenty of people in Europe (at least on Reddit) are as sick of Westminster's pish as the Scots and Irish
They're ready for it all to blow up in their arrogant faces and for them to have to suffer the consequences of the whole "bully bully, rule Britannia" attitude
Are we gonna get into a Macedonian-type argument about what countries can call themselves
haha
Not really
I just weighed up the pros and cons and decided that it was better for the UK/Scotland to be in than out
She's already played the only other woman PM we've had (Thatcher)
Advocating staying in an abusive relationship is horrific
For you, maybe, but not for others, including some people in this thread
Never said they weren't. There will have been many Scots with that attitude in the past
But that's not a part of Scottish identity any more
You'll rarely here Scots harking back for the "good old days of empire". To be fair most English people won't either
Who I'm talking about are those people, especially those in Westminster, who still bang on the empire drum and just expect the world to fall into line
They want to see these people fail, for everything to crumble to ash in their hands
Force them to eat a bit of humble pie
It is an individual thing
It's a fine analogy
You say Wales is buggered because of the actions of Westminster, and yet, you say that it's for that reason they must stay
That's characteristically abusive relationship stuff
I'm confused as to your response here
We're talking about some people in England advocating for getting rid of Scotland and/or Wales as financial burdens
Your response is a non sequitur
If it hasn't shown any interest in doing anything constructive in the past 500 years, what's the likelihood of them doing anything constructive in the next 500
It's like the abusive partner saying "oh, but I'll change"
Spoiler: they won't.
> ...except the UK is a democracy
Mate, an unelected PM just got our elected Parliament closed down by writing a letter to our unelected Queen
He's also denied my country a vote on independence

This is completely without foundation
The broken FPTP system will ensure the Tories or Labour will do nothing to work with smaller parties, it's not in their interests

This is a joke, right
How is that being treated better
And who paid for it
Which government's budget did it come from
I just want you to answer the question I asked
You seem to be suggesting that we should be grateful for being allowed to live in a democracy, and for spending our own money on it

I occasionally think about moving there, and probably would if the University of Malta ever gave me a job (which they won't, because as far as I can tell everything is determined by political patronage and you can only be a professor in Malta if you are connected to one of the two big parties)
Stayed there for a few months, it was really lovely
So much history which I find really interesting, they are super into Christmas, there doesn't seem to be any kind of countryside to speak of and I think the only 'wildlife' I saw were lizards, I couldn't pronounce basically anything Maltese but most people spoke English though I did feel a little guilty about it
I would definitely love to go back if I get the chance

These items were taken from an Ottoman military fort
There is a dispute as to the legality of their removal, Elgin claims he had the authority but there is no independent verification
That he could move items from an Ottoman military fort does suggest he had permission, but then again no corroborating document has been found to his translation
The translation is disputed but hey, that history
Whether he should have or not is another area under dispute
At the time caring about ancient antiquities was something of an obsession of a few eccentric nobles in Europe
There is little evidence people of the time cared, other than one statue that was mistaken for a Christian saint
There is a very good argument the removal disfigured the integrity of the structure and its historical value
There is a weaker, but real argument that moving them to a country that cared for such artefacts reduced the risk they would be damaged as the ruling Ottomans had little interest in archaeology
The modern ideas of preservation of field work and buildings in archaeology are anachronistic, that is out of time when considered
Personally I am open minded on the issue
There are strongish cases on both sides
What this was not about was British imperialism
Also there is a "risk" of president being set, of demands for items to be returned to far more unstable regimes, we have seen recent destruction of ancient artefacts across many countries
Any discussion not acknowledging that this is not a clear case and that the return could have impacts beyond these artefacts themselves is playing for emotive responses rather than a reasoning and thoughtful approach to the complexities
Its also worth noting the Pericles filched money supposedly paid by the Delian League for ships to commission statues and buildings
Its a kind of irony their creation was an act of shall we say, dubious acquisition
This does not change the morality of their current location, just a subtle irony to my mind
Lol yoink
don't forget about a general dislike for the Swiss being neutral
Eh, I find that to be a flimsy justification
I think the best argument against returning stuff because is worrying about these sorts of artefacts being destroyed in countries like [Egypt] or [Ethiopia]
Greece is a first world country, stable and safe, they should have their marbles back
But Middle-Eastern countries that have Iconoclastic Islamists in them
Not as safe
There is also the Museum Fire in Brazil which happened two years ago
Brazil is one of the world's largest economies, and very peaceful (no terrorism, no revolutions, no civil war, etc
), but even they dropped the ball and lost the whole damn thing because the government didn't pay for better sprinklers
Egypt for example claims the Rosetta Stone
Today Egypt is a country that has a pretty good record of looking after artefacts
But it is a country where militant Islamism has a huge following
It is the home of some of the most noted such as Sayyid Qutb and Ayam al-Zawahiri
In its one quasi free election the Muslim Brotherhood took power
Its politically delicate but we cannot assume that Egypt will remain a country where ancient artefacts are secure
Across the world we have seen militant Islamists destroying incredibly valuable items
This does not say the marbles should remain in Britain, but if the debate is allowed to remain a purely low information, slagging fest then the potential consequences of establishing a legal precedent that if you cannot prove you had absolute authority to remove an item it must be returned to the originating country, could fly under the radar

I am sadly reminded of Lincoln's telling the story of Sykes' dog
*‘Have you ever heard about Sykes’s yellow dog
’ said I to the spokesman of the delegation
He said he hadn’t. ‘Well, I must tell you about him,’ said I. ‘Sykes had a yellow dog he set great store by, but there were a lot of small boys around the village, and that’s always a bad thing for dogs, you know
These boys didn’t share Sykes’s views, and they were not disposed to let the dog have a fair show
Even Sykes had to admit that the dog was getting unpopular; in fact, it was soon seen that a prejudice was growing up against that dog that threatened to wreck all his future prospects in life
The boys, after meditating how they could get the best of him, finally fixed up a cartridge with a long fuse, put the cartridge in a piece of meat, dropped the meat in the road in front of Sykes’s door, and then perched themselves on a fence a good distance off with the end of the fuse in their hands
Then they whistled for the dog
When he came out he scented the bait, and bolted the meat, cartridge and all
The boys touched off the fuse with a cigar, and in about a second a report came from that dog that sounded like a small clap of thunder
Sykes came bouncing out of the house, and yelled: ‘What’s up
Anything busted
’ There was no reply, except a snicker from the small boys roosting on the fence; but as Sykes looked up he saw the whole air filled with pieces of yellow dog
He picked up the biggest piece he could find — a portion of the back, with a part of the tail still hanging to it, and, after turning it around and looking it all over, he said, ‘Well, I guess he’ll never be much account again — as a dog

Not really related to this post but on this sub recently I've seen a lot of islamaphobic comments
I'm not one of those people that think any criticism of Islam is horrible and racist, but people need to remember that most Muslims are just normal people that don't really care about committing religious extremism
I just feel like sometimes people need to remember that radicals of any religion don't make up the majority of the followers

How does one even get a banner than size
How much does it cost
How do you transport it
How do you co-ordinate that many people to hold it
I'm impressed, but genuinely confused
(I'm not asking where they get the money from or how they can afford it
More the practical logistics of getting and deploying a banner that big
I wonder who funded this get together
because they know they'll lose
They sign of bills that parliament passes
Power to appoint the Prime Minister and dismiss them
Power to dismiss Mps
Power to declare war and sue for peace
Command over the armed forces
Although in reality the monarch doesn't actually have these powers
If they just decided to use them then people would be campaigning for the abolishment of the monarchy
If the Queen intervened with Parliament and didn't sign a bill or just declared war or dismissed Mps and the Prime Minister without the most of Parliament agreeing then the Royal family would be Abolished
Their role is just traditional things and they don't really have any power over Parliament
I did not ask where they got the money, but I'd rather take Soro's money than Putin's any day

If TM was given the choice she’d remain in the EU, but as PM she has to do what the country wants
It’s no secret she supported remain so I don’t really get the dig here
For context: Harold Wilson wasn't fond of Europe and whipped his MPs to vote against membership in 73
Yet as PM in 1975 he accepted the result of the ref and kept us in
Going by what some on here say he should have just stuck to his own views and pulled us out
TBH at this point Juncker and Tusk should refuse to meet her, she's not coming in good faith, she just want to run down the clock and they are enabling her

Do a Twitter search for "failing EU". They care
Britain is fucked if we leave the EU and it's​ successful without us
If it broke up we'd be no worse off than anyone else
The big issue is Muslim immigrants which I don't think the EU controls
And it's been said that leaving the EU will resolve those issues
No one cared from the opposition to oppose or clarify that though
A lot of leavers did, so our economy wouldn't be relatively much worse off
No, China number one
Austria numbah two
Japan numbah five
Doesn't need to be best, just needs to represent a demographic
Who said "all"? It looks like most, and there is good reason it would be most
It's probably most
Muslim immigrants are coming here cause we used to own that land at some point
Not heard that one before
You really think most Leavers want the EU to succeed
Without us in it
I find that very unlikely
Admittedly I can imagine myself one of them as readily as I can imagine the perspective of a mole or rat
Think about it rationally
People voted Leave for three reasons: to get bilateral trade deals, to kick out foreigners, and to 'take control' of our laws
The free trade people want the EU to fail so we have more trade partners (easily checked by reading what they actually say)
The other two groups shouldn't care but there is overlap between them and the free trade people, and we've already defined them as racist and stupid - so they want the EU to fail for those reasons too
You just needed to think it through
Not just the Uk though
Hmm you've have given me some stuff to look onto now
Have you not been following the debate
All the Daniel Hannan, Douglas Carswell, (ostensibly) Boris Johnson people are arguing for free trade
They want the EU to fail so we have more trading partners
But let's say everyone who voted Leave is more like Farage
Xenophobic little Englanders
Why would they not want the EU to fail
We've defined them as exactly the sort of people who - if they think about foreigners at all - want bad things to happen to them
So all the Leavers we can categorise either want the EU to fail or patriotically don't think about it
Is there a single reason for a Leaver to want the EU to continue
The Leavers you know, your friends the little guys, the average joes - have any of them argued for the success of the EU
Lol yes I was being serious
I was confused, hence why I said you gave me stuff to look into

I imagine the girls were under constant surveillance from their own bodyguards, and from the American government

The problem with Johnson is that It is sometimes difficult to pin down his views on things
We can only really look at his [voring record]
I don't consider him far right but others would disagree
Jon Harvey was the previous Lord Buckethead, but Todd Durham, creator of the character, disliked him, so he stopped him from being Lord Buckethead and chose someone else to replace Harvey
harvey then became Count Binface, counterpart and adversary to Lord Buckethead III
Next election, I demand they have a Lightsaber Duel

How is the symbolism idiotic
When I was in France in 2007, a museum guide mentioned that guillotines were illegal to display as a whole - you could either display the blade or the wooden contraption, but not both together
This law seemed to have been repealed by the time I went back in 2015 - I saw a couple in museums
I wonder if this protest symbolism would have been grounds for arrest 10 years ago
I wrote that just after waking up, and forgot to include the guide's explanation that the display was banned because it was considered an instrument of torture
The compromise was that you could display either the blade or the rest of it
EDIT: Two corrections to your post - the "freedom" derived from the French Revolution is debatable
The guillotine was used on the nobility initially, but the Reign of Terror killed far more innocent civilians and religious figures
The internal kerfuffle was only ended when Napoleon came along
His reign was hardly a democracy
And as for "the last lot these had been used on", remember that the guillotine was still being used right up until 1981 for capital punishment
There have been many people killed on them since the 1790s.
I agree that it's a symbol, but the history behind the symbol tends not to be known by those citing it
There was a [Bourbon Restoration] remember
That "open future" didn't really occur until nearly a century later

I think, and this might just be me, that the EU would be (and maybe only a little, it's hard to tell) open for Scotland to quickly rejoin the EU if independent
I dunno though, might be misinterpreting things (for the past 6 years)
should I leave this sub or I should I stay
Just a heads up that this was a stunt carried out by members of the SNP who ran a series of similar ones around Scotland
This wasn't something that was set up by the EU to show solidarity with Scotland, it was a ploy specifically done by the SNP to make it look as if the EU was saying it
Judging by the other comments in this thread I think we can all recognise the difficulties of leaving a union for which we are deeply intertwined with
As tempting as it is to latch on to Scotlands pro EU leanings please do not use it as a means to further the SNP's ill thought out separatist ideals
Thanks lads
It’s better for the Scottish people this way
Our political ideals have been too diverged for too long
And our population is too small to stop Tory governments being voted in
Consider that they only have 6/59 seats in Scotland
As someone from Scotland, I can assure you that the UK won't come to its senses
Scotland has been getting screwed over by Westminster for decades, if not centuries
This Saga is the last straw for us, and splitting from the UK really is by far or best option now
The burden of keeping the UK together cannot possibly fall to us
Sorry
Scotland and England are poles apart politically these days
So much so that it will most definitely lead to the break up of this sham of a union and the us Scots can happily rejoin the EU
Days I look forward to and hope they will arrive sooner rather than later
Was already requested, twice
Yes but Scotland had a clear majority of remain voters
Brexit vote was 52/48 - I'll refer you to how many Tory MPs there are now
The majority of which are, in fact, english MPs
Right, but the UK is a union of nations and on that basis “such and such has more people than x” is completely meaningless
It’s also not a far cry from saying “well but England has vastly more people so it doesn’t really matter how everybody else voted” which is precisely the reason that the union doesn’t work
When comparing countries or regions or cities with one another, there’s a reason we do so on a per capita basis
> Worth remembering that there are millions more English remainers than Scottish ones
Which is irrelevant
A minority of Scots voted leave and not one single constituency had a majority in favour of it
Not
One
There might me more remain voters in England but there is a *majority* of leave voters
The English wanted to leave, The Scots did not
That is the difference
> division and separatism inside the UK
Certainly isn't being caused by the EU
The EU would have about 15% of powers in Scotland if we were independent
Currently the UK holds 80% of powers in Scotland
It's really not comparable
That's just one reason
> Scexit, scottixit, skagxit
Sounds like a drug overdose whatever word you use
Scoot
No they wouldn’t allow it if we had an illegal referendum if it was legal they said they wouldn’t mind
The problems in splitting up are fairly obvious:
* Scotland does trade more with the rUK than anyone else
That matters when it comes to deciding whether to rejoin the EU - that it has trade with the rUK while part of the EEA would suggest that this is its optimal trading partner
* Scotland does have more public spending than it pays for with the tax revenue it raises - to the extent abolishing the military wouldn't get the gap to a sustainable level
Hard choices would need to be made which frankly aren't a part of the current independence campaign
* Scotland has a relatively bad demographic profile - meaning pressure for increased health and pensions spending will go up while the tax base shrinks
This is a challenge for the UK as a whole, but it's worse for us specifically
None of these are particularly short term problems or things which can be easily addressed
If we were to leave the UK we probably wouldn't even re-join the EU; EFTA would make the most sense
Dealing with the other problems also probably requires actions which most of the public wouldn't be happy about - the independence campaign doesn't exactly talk up the solutions to those problems because it knows they're not going to be popular
Agreed in 2014 we gave them one more chance (don't know why we did as I was for Yes) and the first thing that they did was to draw up EVEL, throw The Smith Comission at us and give us paltry powers
2016 was the straw that broke the camels back, watching every region of Scotland vote Remain whilst England voted Leave and decided the entire result of the referendum was what set the UK down this road
The UK has wrote its own demise with Brexit
We're using Scoot
If Labour hadn’t let Scotland down during the Independence referendum they wouldn’t be in this mess
They took for us for granted
And if they had an effective leader who could make decisions and take a stance
Well no other nation has had a EU referendum in recent years
Never mind one based on lies
There is huge differences between Brexit and Scottish independence though
Brexit is isolationist, backwards and exclusionary
Independence is the opposite of that
Brexit could have been easy and slow and manageable but Boris and his chums knew the best way to get power was to rile up the xenophobia
Anyway
The real problems I have is with the democratic systems in the country
It's incompatible with how I, and pretty much everyone I know, think a country should be run
We also vote differently from England
The political landscape in Scotland is so vastly different
We really need a way to create our own path
To make our own mistakes and our own success
Brexit pulled this into sharp focus for a lot of people
We are not the same country as England and should be ruled by them no more
> Pro-EU Scots like to bang on about how 'Scotland would have a veto' within the EU', completely ignorant of the fact that the EU has been slowly but surely eroding the areas over which the veto can be exercised
And if Scotland ever felt that erosion had gone too far then it would have the right to leave
Right now the Scottish Government can win election after election on a platform of independence and the UK Government can simply say "no, you're staying".

> The political system of the USA was setup in the 17th century
The 18th century
Lack of Congress and Senate term limits isn't a bad thing imo
What country does impose a term limit on its MPs
In the UK, and Canada and Australia, an MP can be re-elected for as many times as their constituents choose them
In Canada the appointed Senators actually hold their office until the mandatory retirement age of 75
Are you aware of what a constitutional monarchy entails
The USA, despite its flaws (of which there are many), is remarkably stable and resilient
Their political system gets a lot of shit, for good reason, but it has managed to survive for 200+ years virtually unchanged
In comparison, France (the other republic) is on its fifth republic
One could even say the USA's problems stem from it being too stable and the political status quo being so strongly entrenched that major reform is difficult to accomplish
Germany became the democracy it is today because they literally got bombed to dust and had a "blank slate" to rewrite their whole government system
It is a bit bizarre how frequently the Americans are able to look at a problem that's been solved elsewhere and then just come up with some totally insane solution that definitely won't do what it's supposed to
It's not totally unique to them by any means of course - it might be that they're just louder about their weirdness
Yet the Westminster model appears to be more stable-look at the UK, Canada and Australia
The US is far more religious than the UK despite the HOL
Because it’s only there in theory
Religion plays basically no part in British politics
There is no religious voting block
Yeah but we'd never get a Trump as PM
> has more than one major independence movement
Nothing wrong with that
our uncodified laws allows the people to have more of a say in this regard to these movemnets via referendums
Well yes, it’s how our political system evolved over the centuries
I love having the Queen to be honest
You can critique both models

A nice idea but too many people in Scotland are Biggoted against the Irish, there would definetly be unjustified backlash
The current arrangement in the British isles is not one of subjugation or force but one of convenience and friendliness
Further Balkanising the UK favours absolutely no one and is idiotic
From Scotland, no
There are a lot of issues that come from Scotland being independent, lot more issues that come from Scotland joining the ROI
Only if we could saw off Northern Ireland and stick it just above Wales
No, Germany, we will not
That first word would cause riots in Glasgow though even if it is pronounced differently
Ewwy

Let's do it
And I want a bridge/tunnel network linking Brittany, Cornwall, Ireland, Scotland, shetlands, Orkney and Norway
/r/mapswithoutshetland
A jokey wee picture really seems to have triggered the English in this thread
I don't think many would support independence to join another political union as it kind of ruins the point
It's not like Scotland and Ireland wouldn't be having grand craic on the international stage together anyway
I'm not against this, RoI is a nice place
No thanks to a Celtic Union, full EU membership post-Independence and a bridge between Scotland and Belfast (as part of a united Ireland) is the dream
I do like that flag
No thanks
That would be cool
I’m open to this idea
The Welsh are a celtic people too, it wouldn't be fair to leave them like that with England
Scots and Irish are best mates
We’re the Great part of Britain
The arguing against the UK isn't arguing against the concept of a union generally, I don't know why so many people don't get this, just because you consider leaving a shitty job doesn't mean you must then be unemployed for life rather than simply looking for a better one
>Would Scots get out of a union after so much blabla just to get in to another one
This is like arguing that it makes no sense for divorced people to remarry
It only happened because people here were told they'd get to stay in the EU
What a surprise that turned out to be for them
The United Kingdom of Innovative Jams and Adequate Food
Nah, just our laws are so conflicting
For example, Scotland has more religious freedom than both Irelands and a lot of Irish in Northern Ireland prefer to be called British
Another is if they were to unify then what would you call yourself
Irish
Scottish
Irottish
Sure as hell not Celtic as Celtic is more than just Ireland and Scotland
It's already confusing and that's just three points
We can't even agree on the spelling in Gaelic

Scottish here, can confirm they ruined Scotland
TIL the objection is official
> The term "British Isles" is controversial in Ireland,[8][16] where there are nationalist objections to its usage
[17] The Government of Ireland does not officially recognise the term,[18] and its embassy in London discourages its use
[19] Britain and Ireland is used as an alternative description,[17][20][21] and Atlantic Archipelago has also seen limited use in academia

I remember when this happened, I was in Glasgow playing Warhammer, a friend in the store told me about it we were in shock when he said what had happened
Stand for these people, never back down
I remember that very well
I got out of bed the next morning and everyone had #prayforparis on their Snapchat stories
So I turned on the news and saw what had happened
Turns out my mums cousin was actually in Paris competing in a competition at the time and she was very close to the attack
One thing that still spooks me today is that my older brother was at one of the cafe’s bombed the day before
Yoooo
Yooooooooooooo

Yeah, what did he think would happen

Might well have been the point of it
Yes
That's pretty much it

Just a point of order: he does believe in climate change, IIRC he had to build a wall to protect his Irish golf course (citing climate change as a reason)
What I believe he and the Republicans believe is that the measures taken now would be more harmful than doing nothing and waiting for technology to develop to reverse the damage after it has been done
Yeah, on twitter
His *actions* with his business prove otherwise
He's a liar sure, but a businessman
Quite possibly
These people only know coal; anything else is scary and uncertain - of course they'll vote for the guy promising them something familiar
You, me, and every economist out there can know coal is dying, but that is all these people their fathers and their fathers fathers have ever worked
It's understandable why they voted for him
>it's equally stupid
For poor people maybe, but the wealthy won't feel climate change in any significant way
You might think that's a shitty attitude, but it's not stupid
>the Republicans don't seem to have a plan to rely on new tech to reverse climate change
Looking at what they're doing (removing regulations and generally freeing the market), I believe they're wanting the market to do that naturally - i.e. without government interference
>removed a burden on green energy
What burden
Right now there are subsidies for it: that means it's not competitively viable yet - it's close, very close even
>politically-motivated hostility being more likely IMO
I agree with this: solar is owned by China just now - it's not good for the American economy to encourage buying solar if all the profits and jobs are in China

Mosley was at this point a pan-European nationalist
His party that year was called the National Party of Europe
"The idea came to fruition at the Conference of Venice in 1962 when the leaders of the Union Movement, the Deutsche Reichspartei, the Italian Social Movement, Jeune Europe and the Mouvement d'Action Civique came together to form this group
The European Declaration at Venice was released on 1 March 1962 and contained the following ten aims:
The creation of Europe a Nation through a common European government
The creation of an elected European parliament
The continuation of national parliaments with their authority limited to social and cultural matters
Economics to be driven by the wage-price mechanism to ensure fair wages and economic growth
The creation of an economic alternative to capitalism and communism
More worker control and less bureaucracy in nationalized industries
The withdrawal of American and Soviet forces from Europe
An end to the role of the United Nations with the US, USSR and Europe acting as three equals
Decolonization with a move to set up single-ethnic governments in former colonies
Europe to be defined as mainland territory outside of the USSR, the United Kingdom, overseas territories and around one-third of Africa

The first thing that strikes me about this programme is that many of the subscribers of /r/europe would agree with it
So would many enthusiasts for the European Union in general
The position is "Neither Washington nor Moscow" and a third way economically
Where they might disagree is with point 5, preferring liberal capitalism of some kind, point 7, being broadly America-friendly and Russia-phobic, point 9, which hardly applies now, and point 10 especially the bit about Europe including one-third of Africa
Who knows what the thinking was there, perhaps trying to recreate the Roman Empire
good
Yes, same bloke
Also the infamous "beady eyed Anglo" in some memes nowadays, although (ironically) that meme is mostly peddled by Fascists who are still frothing about the "Anglo being the Jews puppet" and whatnot
"Beady eyed Anglos betrayed European civilisation" and whatnot
It's one hell of a weird meme
Apart from, you know
being a facist
Good
Good
What sanctimonious hypocritical nonsense
Why don't they have a day to remember the victims of capitalism and imperialism
What about the mountains of corpses they've produced with their mealy-mouthed "democracy" (read: capitalism), worse in its way than communism or fascism because more insidious
Lmao way to totally ignore the history of WW2 to fit the Western narrative that the commies and Nazis are just as evil
Do you know that the USSR tried to get the liberal Western European states on board with an anti-fascist invasion of Germany well before WW2
When that failed, they really had no choice but to sign a non aggression pact - 20 million Soviets died in the Nazi invasion, what do you think would've happened without those extra 2 years to prepare
Appeasement is seen as a great failure by this country - it's why Chamberlain's reputation is so poor
There's a push online to equivocate the Nazis with the Western Allies driven by a combination of the alt-right and useful idiots on the far left
Molotov-Ribbentrop is seen as worse both because the Soviets used it for their own massive land grabs (how did invading Finland contain Germany again
), because of what they did in the occupied territories, and because the Soviets provided Germany with oil as it was fighting the Allies
> Can't you just have a day to hate the worst regimes that have been created
I hate them 365 days
> They outweigh the deaths of what capitalism has done
Never
Capitalism is creating new bodies every day, at least the commies and Nazis have been stopped
Both world wars, all the wars of imperialism, all the Cold War wars, all the preventable poverty deaths, all the deaths of despair, all the Climate Change deaths to come
Worse because more insidious
> It's like a person advertising a funeral of someone at another person's funeral
The funeral of Nazism was in 1945, and the funeral of communism was in 1989
The funeral of capitalism
when
If it were primarily about containing socialism then they could have avoided war over Poland as well
This is why most believe Chamberlain was appeasing to re-arm rather than to bait war with the Soviets (which wasn't going to break out when they didn't even border Germany)
The equivocation of the Soviets and Nazis is a problem, and mostly comes from Eastern Bloc countries except Russia
Unfortunately a lot of the pushback comes from Western Europeans and Americans standing up for Stalin rather than making a sober assessment
I'd agree that many in the West hoped that the Soviets and Nazis would destroy each other
A similar hope existed in Moscow - that the war in the West would drag out like World War I. The Germans were much more paranoid and assumed the communists and the West were secretly working with each other
In the modern era these three factions all believe something closer to what Germany thought - that the other two sides were working together the whole time

I'm British and I only know weights intuitively in kilos I would give my height in cm too
I hope it be ones more common because stones is the most a shed unit
At least Americans have the decency to just use pounds which is a straight conversion from kilos by multiplying by 2
2 (or 2 to be rough)
Stone you have to them divide by 14
It's so far removed from kilos I don't have a scooby what it actually means, it's just numbers
Well that was just cruel

Isn't these an expression like "WW2 was won with British intelligence, American steel and Russian blood"?

They formed up over the Lake District, moving North, and have fanned out into a big bow wave
I’m as bleeding heart liberal as they come but it simply boggles my mind that anyone would uproot their lives to move somewhere they do not want to live, that is incompatible with their fundamental values and way of life
Or alternatively, if they are not first generation, and feel their beliefs are more inline with where their parents or grandparents immigrated from, seek to emigrate there to be around more like minded individuals
That is surely a more pleasant existence
Nobody who feels “at home” goes around harbouring so much hate and resentment for their fellow countrymen going about their peaceful days
I will not move to Saudi Arabia as I do not want to live in a country with no alcohol, the death penetration for being gay, and lesser rights for women
Those ideologies are fundamentally different to my own values and so I will remain in places where I wish to be
Edit: obviously I meant “death penalty”, but the autocorrect is pretty funny to me in a serious context so I’ll leave it

Or not, this was an isolated incident by a 21 year old unhinged idiot who doesn't represent anything at all about the cultures you speak
But you love it when someone agrees with you, don't you
I think you (the French) have one big asset on your side: the Republic
It took a century after the French Revolution to finally settle down, but you have a broad consensus on the importance of certain democratic, constitutional, laic values
You can articulate the 'values of the Republic' in a clear, coherent way
You can draw a line between what is and is not acceptable
It's much harder for other countries, who haven't got those foundations, to do so
The point is to always emphasise that the values you are defending are the values of the Republic: they are democratic, constitutional, laic values
That should at least provide a degree of common ground across most of the political spectrum

The reason the roads are great in Romania

> Now most of us have realised the ugly face of US imperialism
Rather pathetic that it took Trump for that to happen
Obama fucks up Syria, 1 million Syrians flood Europe, and he still manages to have over 50%+ positive approval ratings in Germany because
he's cool or something
Trump has actually avoided creating any *new* conflicts in the ME (thereby already fucking up the EU less than Obama indirectly did), but he is reviled and compared to Hitler because he says dumb things on twitter

Why are people annoyed that other people are protesting BLM/police brutality rather than Hong Kong
It's ironic that some people are annoyed about what people are choosing to protest about
China oppressing Hong Kong is a Hong Kong issue
Racism is a worldwide issue
It's not hard to see why one issue draws in more people than the other
Besides, a lot of European countries are more racist than the USA
The BLM protests are needed in Europe as much as they are in the USA, if not more so
It was a thing by the FDP
I think they did it for publicity

I love that it says (Metropolitan only)
As if adding the rest would make a difference
TIL France is a real country
Yes but if it wasn't metropolitan only it would still be 1:1
There’s a great wee brewpub on the other side which is a cracking way to spend an afternoon
Good beer in general in Newcastle to be fair
As an Eyemouth native (5 minutes north of Berwick) sadly the only real idiosyncrasy of any note is the fact that Berwick Rangers play in the Scottish football league (or whatever it’s called), and not England where they are located
Assert dominance and put a polish flag down over them
Can you also upload the picture from immediately afterwards of them all floating in the pool
You saw this at 7am
So they have been there for two hours

I mentioned Scotland in another post awhile ago and got meet with such hostility
Do you guys hate us now
Càite a bheil Alba
I see how it is
Ahem, Scotland
Do white next
mods talking pish
This seems quite extreme
Isn't it a legitimate question rather than brigading
We've just been patched by all of Europe here D:
They are most definitely a country
It’s just very easy to forget them cause they are in a union of nations
But I have a feeling we won’t have to wait long to see them as an independent nation again
Edit: Scotland is a country
One of the oldest countries
Your country will play them at football, rugby, etc
They have their own parliament
They have their own legal system separate from England
A distinct culture, language and dialects
I could go on but you get the jist
Any denying of Scotland being its own country is just nonsensical pettiness from unionist or those who aren’t too aware of Scotland’s unique situation and long history as a large country (by European standards)
Scotland is a country
I appreciate the input from the people of Southern Ireland
Scotland is a country
Fuck you and your meetballs, I bet your personality is flat packed mate it’s so shite
Has a flag ever more epically crashed and burned compared to what it was trying to achieve
lol
Celtic & Rangers pubs worldwide are defacto embassies
So you think Scotland is a province of the UK no different to Essex
I shouldn't reply to trolls like you but we have a border, a parliament, our own language, our own education system
We were independent for 1000 years before this union
We are a nation thank you very much
> not administrative divisions called "countries" for some reason
The reason being that they're countries in a union
I didn't say it was a sovereign state
I said it was more than a fucking local authority
Its a nation not a region
No i don't care too much on the map I care about people saying my country is the same as a region of a nation
Its rude
Scotland is a country
Feel free to also call those countries then
Yes and I was addressing their comment about Scotland being no different to a Swiss Canton
No, country means country
Post says countries
Scotland is a country, always has been
The UK is coming to an end, happy days
It's really not what people voted for as it was 55% against brexit in Northern Ireland
You mean thats not an accurate drawing of BlowJob
I can get on board with this
I'm aware, I can laugh at it though
You forgot the
UK "you need us more than we need you"
I have a feeling that this is going to be the negotiations from both sides for a while
Both as shown in the gif and the reverse with the UK telling the EU to fuck off
I don't think I've actually seen any demands from the UK in the news, just stuff about the ECJ, Money owed etc
just kill me, this was such a stupid decision
The best would probably be UK(excluding NI) as GB excludes all the islands of the UK and the crown dependencies
If you actually look at the comments, it's the other way around ;)
You're thinking of Little Britain
30 degrees *average* over the whole summer would but not individual days
There are plenty of places the temperature varies 30 degrees
Americans couldn't draw the map in the first place if they tried to make one
I like the Cantonese version of this expression which translates to
"**It's all chicken's intestines to me**"
'*It's All Klatchian* to Me
I say “it’s like trying to read hieroglyphs”
In the UK people also say "double dutch" meaning pretty much the same thing
We need list of all MEPs who voted in favour, with contact details
Also you need to commit to never vote for anyone on said list ever again in any election
Selling out should result in career suicide
Can we check how our mep voted yet
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahahah
another good reason to leave the EU
Yay
I’ve been thoroughly enjoying Mullvad for about 6 months now
Flat €5 a month, zero personal information required (you can send them cash in an envelope along with your randomly generated user code if you really want to stay anonymous), super simple desktop application, good mobile support, good lineup of servers and locations to choose from
Who says we are getting a deal at this point
Might as well blindfold yourself and throw darts in the general direction of a board with the options on it to see if you can randomly hit one in order to make a guess at where things might end up
I didn't even see it at first and very unlikely I would have seen it irl
Fun fact that I discovered around 6 years ago getting caught in a winter storm in north america, -40C is the same as -40F. I still don't understand F, but there it is

It's worthless as far as I can tell
And then we did it again 2 decades later
Humans suck
The Taiping Rebellion might genuinely rival WW1 as the "second worst war ever" (number of deaths), and it all started because a Chinese student had a mental breakdown and proclaimed himself the brother of Jesus Christ
This is not a joke or exaggeration
An estimated 20-30 million Chinese people died because of this lunatic
Just wait until you hear about that time when 20-30 million people in China died because some failed student thought he was the younger brother of Jesus Christ
No, this is not a joke, this shit actually happened
Read more about the Eastern Front, China and the Asian Theatre
Finally, one I can answer
At one point, many years ago, I had just sold my house and made a nice profit
I was in the middle of a career break and looking for new directions
I also happened to be visiting Poland at the time
I looked into buying a business there - a small supermarket or coffee shop - but decided that the risk of Russian invasion leading to the Partition of Poland and the capture of my assets by Putin was too great
And that's why I didn't invest in Eastern Poland
You are in NATO now
So you are completely safe, so long as the US doesn't elect a President who is an isolationist supported by the Kremlin
Oh, wait
This colourisation is amazing
I can't decide whether to hate or love it
Depends on the fairy tale
Like the one where the girl marries a king, he goes off to war, the kings mum tries to kill her and the kids then cuts her hands of and drives them out into the woods so she sells them to the devil because they are starving
The devil gives her a pair of silver hands so she can look after herself
Then hubbie gets blinded and ends up wandering in the woods too
EDIT I could see Koschei the Deathless living there
He didn't have to have the referendum - I can't quite figure out if it was hubris or vanity that finally convinced him to do it but it was definitely a deadly sin
I agree there is a special circle of hell reserved for Gove and Johnson, but I also see austerity economics as the primary cause for the disillusionment with Westminster
The 2011 riots were a warning ignored - deprivation and penury over prolonged periods leads to extremism, something that had been clearly established after WW2
this is Tusks take on it after talking to Cameron prior to the 2015 election
>Mr Tusk said: “I asked David Cameron ‘Why did you decide on this referendum, this – it’s so dangerous, so even stupid, you know
’. And, he told me – and I was really amazed and even shocked – that the only reason was his own party
>Mr Tusk continued: “[He told me] he felt really safe, because he thought at the same time that there’s no risk of a referendum, because his coalition partner, the Liberals, would block this idea of a referendum
But then, surprisingly, he won and there was no coalition partner
So paradoxically David Cameron became the real victim of his own victory
I agree with your points but would add the banking crisis was squarely caused by the previous labour administration under Brown not saying no to pressure from the banks to lax controls , but primarily, it was caused by the greed of the banks
And seeing the costs being passed to the public along with those of corporate tax evasion, to then continue to adopt austerity measures essentially punishing people for the excesses of business and trying to hide it behind a demonisation of the poor
Those were ideological vanity choices made by Cameron and Clegg, and perpetuated by Cameron
Do the Finnish Police ever need to use skiis, maybe not for cities but I can see that being quite  important
Why are organisations doing this
It just seems like a waste of time and public money
Because it’s a nice car
Good thing is we can all still be close allies even if we are not in a political union
Except we voted to NO
/r/Europe loves to pretend that the UK voted to Remain and Scotland voted Yes
What you want isnt reality
Europe - Scotland is gonna need your support to get away from its abusive partner
I'm not sure what you mean I'm Scottish and most people here are pro EU
Yeah it’s a stupid mentality for anyone to have
Just for leaving a trade block
Brits would not have the same view if someone else had left instead of us
Better get the hammers and saws, we need to move the parliament of Great Britain out of London
How high is it compared to nations like italiy France Poland and hungry which are also euro septic
Hopefully once we've left everything can normalise quickly
This is true, I don't get why people don't understand this
Do you ever see any American or Chinese products in the UK
Exactly, you don't. We're not in a union with them so we cannot physically do any trade with them
Right now Scotland can trade with the EU and UK
If it leaves both, there won't be anyone to trade with, they'll need to completely fend for themselves
I went to Iceland last month, and they're not in the EU, nor the UK
Guess what it is like there
Yep, there's nothing
Cars don't even exist there yet
I would say the big difference here though, is this is our second spike, which was predicted to be worse than the first
The US however never dealt with their first spike like we did and are seeing constant spikes and the graph even shows
Most likely we will spike and then dip similar to the first one, the US on the other hand will dip slightly and then grow further because they aren't dealing with it
God fucking damnit
As a remainer, THE PEOPLE VOTED FOR BREXIT, TRYING TO STOP THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS MAKES YOU LOOK LIKE A FIRST CLASS MORON

I always thought complaining about the weather was only a British past time
As time goes on, and the more people I speak to from across the world, the more I realise that everyone likes to complain about the weather
Hot, cold, wet, dry, windy or snowy, people love to complain
And it’s absolutely glorious
It’s the go-to small talk when things get awkward
Wow, the Dutch and the British are the same people
This video could easily be about British people and their relationship with the weather
I honestly can't process this fully
Hell, just the travelling photographic Holocaust Museum exhibit made me bawl

Is that the church that Corvus Glaive smacked Vision about on the roof of in Avengers: Infinity War
What do you mean
Heavy use of sandstone which tends to darken upon exposure to soot from smoke due to the structure of the stone, partially from industry but also because coal fires were just how buildings were heated
The nickname for Edinburgh is "Auld Reekie" (Scots for "Old Smoky")
Some buildings have been cleaned but the techniques are damaging so are used sparingly
There is also the issue of "should the buildings be cleaned
". When restoring a building, how do you choose what era to restore it to
If its raining the stone becomes darker
Yes it was caused by the pollution
The buildings are made of sandstone which is a lot lighter in colour
Nah, that was St Giles Cathedral, which is a bit further down the road
The church there is actually no longer a church - it’s called The Hub and is an event space

It would have meant your system wasn't stupid
If you had a simple FPTP system then Le Pen might have won the first round
This way all the reasonable parties can unite against her

This hurts to look at, at least the EU contributions would turn into productive projects the UK would benefit from, this is just burning money
We can also cut out the middle man and invest in ourselves
Yeah, because we were totally being ruled by Brusseld and had absolutely no control over our country already
If tomorrows world truly is that of empires we'll be assimilated into one regardless
It doesn't matter anyway as he is one single person, one single MEP for Belgium and as such it's extremely dishonest to take his own views and use them to vilify the EU as a whole and represent them as very widespread across EU nations
Then the EU can leave a corner of the sign, but take the rest
Maybe the 'fun-' part can stay
That 5th in the world is going to be for long
Once we leave our favourable position that'll drop
Anyway, you're talking like we'd have a choice if the world of tomorrow becomes one of empires
We're a small island and the world is already very different from the one where the British Empire once reigned
It's all irrelevant anyway you're still taking a single quote from one single person (it doesn't matter if he is "the EU's top negotiator" as you put it) and using it to vilify and misrepresent an entire union of countries which is ncredibly dishonest
Nice job to Austria, Croatia, and Latvia, the surprise leaders
It's interesting how sudden and rapid our change here in the UK is
Sometimes I really hate that I live in the UK
A shame that Cyprus can’t look at what you are doing
My point was a comment to a post about Denmark (which has one of the highest percentages of renewables) vs Cyprus which looks like it has the lowest
Of course *all* countries need to shift their blend of power generation towards more renewables
Examination of the charts shows that most counties are making active progress
Sadly the Cyprus graphic also looks like little progress is being made
It’s a lovely country - famous for its good weather but having the same 2020 7% target as Germany seems like setting the bar too low
Malta has a population density of 1354 people per km2 on an area of 320 km2
Cyprus has 130 per km2 on an area of 9240 km2
So they aren’t as comparable as you say
Given its geographical location and dependence on imported fuels I would have thought this be a higher priority for Cyprus
It’s not just me thinking this:
Edit - word
There are EfW projects around the world digging up old landfills and treating them like mines
We now have pretty good waste separation technology which can pull out recyclables (ferrous/non-ferrous metals etc) leaving putrescible materials as feedstock for anaerobic digestion and easily combusted materials to supply gasification/combustion processes
Sadly, in the U.K. at least, so many of the projects I know of have struggled with various issues: bad design, overly ambitious budgets, poor engineering & dodgy installation, etc
Hopefully we get through this teething period sooner, rather than later
Source - work in EfW
I am aware of the costs involved
That’s why you appoint an EPC to take the risk and provide the energy
Yes
That’s exactly it
Plus the geopolitical security risk of being dependant on importing in what is a fairly unstable area
And EfW can make money while minimising loss of land through tipping
Why are they carrying him battering ram style though and not stretcher
That's not how diplomats work
Belarus is not part or even aligned with the EU so expelling missions from Belarus but not Saudi Arabia, China, Egypt, ect
would be extremely biased
Severing ties with dictatorships tends to result in them doubling down and wielding it as propaganda, not suddenly deciding to respect the will of the people
Further sanctions are a different matter, though
The UK continuing to be the USA of Europe
Well we have Greggs if you and it you’d understand
Always kinda annoys me when graphs and maps show UK as one entity, like Scotland, Ireland, Wales and England are all so massively different culturally, it's only the government that is overarching and even then each country has its own government anyway
But doing % of UK is basically the same thing as just doing % of England cause of the massive population discrepancy
Uk is chonky

I'm just thinking what it says about these buildings, we know the kinds of buildings supermarkets and fast food places opt to build, looking at the opulence of these buildings, there's no chance these companies would pay to maintain them in good condition, it pretty much represents a temporary occupation while these places decline, that to me is a great shame

News agencies always skew the graphs as most people will just look at the graph and not the figures
At least we’re higher than Russia I suppose
As a Brit, I definitely didn't like the look of that figure, but I felt a lot better when I saw the USA number
It's correct though our government is a mess, we're in desperate need of some French Revolution style shit and the current party in power should not be trusted one bit

She is English not Scottish
I agree with everything but she doesnae sound very Scottish tae me
Are you sure she is Scottish
Cause that ain't an accent I've ever heard up here
Not to be pernickity but she's clearly no Scottish
Well said though
So Scottish alliance with basically everyone in Europe then
Sounds good to me
As I said somewhere else, your nationality isn't defined by your accent
There are plenty of people that are from or living in a country but don't have the accent
In fact, there are people who have nationality for countries they don't live in
As far as I'm aware, she *isn't* from Scotland, but her accent alone isn't proof of that
Fun fact: That street directly in the middle of the photo that goes up to the left is called ‘Cockburn Street’.

It goes by the passport and not the flag

I'm well aware of what it said in the article, no Public figure that is for Independence is seriously advocating UDI
If I hadn't read it I wouldn't have posted it
Touché.
Why are you twisting my words like that
Literally no need to be so hostile
It's not all about politics and nationality though, it's about EU states showing solidarity and support for Scotland through all this Brexit crap
I think it extends beyond that to Romanians = street beggars, because there are so many people in the UK who have been trafficked over (from Romania or elsewhere I don't know, although it's said they're Roma) and people say they're only pretending to be homeless so they can make money for dodgy gangs in Eastern Europe
>Wouldnt the uk just send its military in then
To do what
If there was a serious majority for independence then sending in the military would have no impact beyond a few weeks and create huge social unrest
The mechanics of setting up a taxation system and paying for a bureaucracy would make a "UDI" an economic disaster
In reality London would just drive a very hard bargain in negotiating while Scotland struggled with currency issues
You cannot raise sovereign debt if you are not sovereign
A thing like this does not make any difference
Solidarity and support are just words with nothing behind them
And a flag is a piece of coloured cloth
Nothing happens when you hang up a piece of coloured cloth in a street
Yes but things change, Alex Salmond is no longer an SNP MP, hell he's not even an SNP member
The SNP stated in their 2016 that if there was grounds to hold a referendum they would seek to hold one
Those Grounds are Brexit, Brexit has changed everything
Even the The Tories agree with the polls being in favour of Scottish Independence it can no longer be denied
We don't hate English people
As a nation we definitively voted against Brexit but are now out of the EU against our will
On top of that, one of the biggest arguments the pro union campaign used against independence was that by voting no, we would be guaranteeing our eu membership
The conservative government that's in charge of the UK is widely hated in Scotland and England only seems to be getting more conservative, meaning we will be left with a government we in no way voted for
I just think politically England and Scotland are going in two very different directions and it doesn't make sense for us to be dragged along with them
Ah yes 58% for independence in the last poll but apparently ‘not in our lifetime’ as if the union will last
We're not karens either, I see why some people get frustrated
Every day from the English it's either "you're never getting independence" but also "looool can't wait for them to leave they're nothing ng but a drain on GLORIOUS ENGLAND" but also simultaneously "nooo don't go we r stronger together "
There's nothing in the 2012 Edinburgh Agreement on which The 2014 Independence Referendum wasn't about "Once in a Generation",it wasn't even on the Agreement
Jeremy Corbyn said that the 2019 Election was "Once in a generation chance for change". When Alex Salmond was talking about "Once in a Generation" that's pretty much the same point
What Alex Salmond said was "The Referendum is a Once in a Generation Opportunity".
Mate I couldnt give a rat's arse, I'd just rather not have a racist lying prick in charge of my country thanks

I'd love to see George Square pedestrianised, but I know for a fact that all the drivers would be up in arms because "how am I supposed to get to the other side of George Square
Christ don't even get me started
You even remotely suggest pedestrianising any single part of Glasgow City Centre and all of a sudden you've got a million car drivers screeching "HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO GET MY SHOPPING HOME
" or "WE'LL JUST GO TO THE FORGE INSTEAD"
I wonder what the fourth era will look like
Looks like a big of an evil building thing

Fuck
Can I stay
Does this mean I have to leave this sub on the 31st
at least we'll still be neighbours :)
See yous soon when we're getting the Celtic Craic Union on the go
Here's hoping
Not all that much difference
We stay in the single market through the transition period, which includes freedom of movement
If you do come to the UK this year, you can apply for [pre-settled status online] for no cost
This allows you to stay in the UK on effectively the same basis as you can now
At the end of the transition period, which ends at midnight on 31 December 2020
Irish Border Boogaloo is just a reboot of 'The Troubles' I hear
At least you're automatically entitled to an EU passport
I just wish we'd taken our chance in 2014
I fear we may now be in for a long fight

That's such a sweet story :)

No it's fine, I find family histories interesting :)
Its The Crown really just a classy rewrite of the past 60 years of UK tabloid headlines
The 80's was when Koch started cracking down hard on minor offences like littering and avoiding subway fares, arguably a sign of the modern American carceral state
You wouldn't have seen litter like this
What the fuck Germany
I had my fill of Diana media bullshit when I was a bloody toddler, I cannot imagine *willingly* consuming more of it
You'd be surprised at how some of the older east coast cities in the US retain some level of English esque architecture
[I find it a damn shame that places like Boston are the exception] rather than the norm, for the USA
Italy and Spain were also often used as replacements for Texas and Arizona in spaghetti Western films
Bloody shame too, I don't think any royal family in Europe could top the Habsburgs in
eccentricities
> It's like they're so scared that if any of their protagonists are racists (which they probably would be given that time period)
Lmao we don't even have to guess, Prince Philip has no filter on whatsoever
He's the entire nation's racist uncle
I’d rather be in the US sphere of influence
Jesus christ his roof, suspension, hood
damn, that poor car
thats probably not good for the suspension
What
Even today Rotterdam is well regarded for its modern architecture
For such a heavily bombed city Rotterdam was able to redefine itself and remake its identity
Go to Dresden if you want a bad example of modernism
Unless you're suggesting every example of modernism is worthless
>Rotterdam was punitive and destroyed for no other reason than to make the Netherlands submit
There was no tactical reason
Are you arguing for or against the both sides are equally bad rhetoric
The area bombings of Germany were also ordered to make them submit, but instead of one large city it was every large city
Why is the both sides equally bad rhetoric so bad
Should we just ignore holding anyone of team A accountable to war crimes because team B's supporters are racist
The following is a comically evil, somehow real quote of Arthur Harris who believed that somehow killing as many civilians as possible would make Germany surrender
He said this in response to official statements that the bombings were only targeting industrial and economic targets with the civilian casualties or property damage being unintentional
>The aim of the Combined Bomber Offensive [...] should be unambiguously stated [as] the destruction of German cities, the killing of German workers, and the disruption of civilised life throughout Germany [...] the destruction of houses, public utilities, transport and lives, the creation of a refugee problem on an unprecedented scale, and the breakdown of morale both at home and at the battle fronts by fear of extended and intensified bombing, are accepted and intended aims of our bombing policy
They are not by-products of attempts to hit factories
I mean Antonio Costa's, P.S party has done an incredible job
He has managed to reverse a lot of damaging austerity while systematically improving the economy and public finances
Here is a good article and interview by world politics review
If you are interested in Portuguese politics have a quick look at the result of their elections on October 6th as it should be very interesting
Portugal has really made an incredible economic recovery
If you want to have a Google there are lots of other interesting stories about Portuguese politics

God as a Scot seeing us greyed off the map is an absolute gut punch
I was looking for the UK in the list, couldn't see it, looked at the map and it was greyed out
I'm proud to be Scottish, but not proud to be british anymore
For info - here's the RSF reasoning for this ranking:
Honestly
That's suprisingly better than I expected
Smart move
Which country is it that Germans can get into the others can't?
As a Scottish person this makes me so very very sad
I saw them really high on a list of anti-vax countries the other day
They might be Hungary but they’re not thirsty

FIXED
Oh my goodness
Glaswegian here - this makes me homesick
Can't wait to travel back again
It used to be the entrance to the Subway, the architecture matched the hotel that used to stand nearby
The hotel has since been replaced with a modern shopping centre
The Subway station is still there, but it has a new [glass entrance] now
It’s the old subway station that’s been converted
There's a photo from back in the 70s/80s where this building is suspended in the air while the subway was being renovated underneath and around it, it looks mental, like how did those pylons support the entire weight of that building
[edit:[found it
Fun fact, it used to be the entrance to the St Enoch subway station before becoming disused and then renovated into the Cafe Nero you see now
I just moved here and I go past that coffee shop everyday
it's so surreal to see it on reddit with thousands of upvotes lol
If I remember correctly, it's the old ticket office for the underground at St Enoch
The ticket office us now underground and the coffee shop has the building now
I've been in there
It's very nice
Love Glasgow, Scotland
Walked past it many times, but never been in
Tbf though I'd imagine it's much the same as any other Cafe Nero on the inside, so probably best to just admire it from the outside
FYI the armadillo pattern you can see in the doorway is actually a reflection of the St Enoch subway entrance behind the photographer
I just moved here from up north and I never want to leave, it's such a lovely city
right there with you, been living in Dundee for years now and it's just not the same
YOU CAN'T HANDLE MY POTIONS, TRAVELLER
Same
Well it's a lot more functional, there's actually 2 of them, one on either side of the station
You couldn't really filter modern commuter crowds through that old building which is why they changed it up
But yeah, not the most timeless architecture is it
ah what are the chances
came up for uni myself, still not thought of an escape plan yet
Better than the utilitarian orange and brown brick buildings that they replaced
They were very much of their time (late 70's/early 80's)
I did too, then I ended up staying
Dundee's no Glasgow, but it's got everything you need and there are a lot of similarities (both got majority 'Yes' in indyref for example
All in all I'm happy here, but I used to go back home at least fortnightly (I really miss my family just now)
I hope you enjoy yourself here too
yeah took me ages to actually start exploring but there's some nice spots like the law & balgay park (even if I like to joke otherwise) and aye another Yes city is nice too
same here about missing family, Dundee's nice but it'll never be home without that
The UK doesn't deserve presents
This whole thing has been the biggest pile of stupidity and lies since the Daily Mail added a comments section

They do seem to love coal for some reason
Sorry for our country, merry Christmas all :L
They don't credit it there either
It's by David Schneider (on Twitter)
We ffffffucked it
As a British person, I see European hostility to current UK policies as sympathy with British people
Isn't brown coal still popular because the green lobby was able to force the planned phase out of German nuclear plants after Fukushima

No, it isn't.

Call me when the Dutch start building islands just off the coast of Norfolk to try and enforce non existent territorial claims on the North Sea
I left home at 16, almost 17
It was pretty much a disaster and I ended up moving back home within 2 years, which wasn't well-received and resulted in a lot of conflict and tension
With hindsight, I see it as a terrible indictment of my family situation, given that I actually *wanted* to leave home at such a young age, and my mother not only stood back and watched it happen, but actually went along with it
I think the fact I expressed an interest in moving out should have caused alarm bells to ring, but my mother just naively assumed I would be fine, when in fact I was very immature and tremendously unprepared for adult life
Looking back, I can see how poorly it went affected my entire life, undermining my confidence and damaging my educational, social and career prospects
I had a lot of disadvantages to overcome growing up, and feeling the need to essentially flee the family home only made a bad situation worse IMO
Having said that the situation at home was really unbearable for me, so perhaps I did the best thing I could in the circumstances

It's also said that the shiny sporrans in WWI reflected a lot of light - making the wearer easier to see and giving the Germans a nice central target to aim for

He never said to deny anything
It would be more like Germany saying "yes the Holocaust happened but it was a state that no longer exists that was responsible". But even then, Hitler was elected on his platform of anti-Semitism and the German people knew more about the Holocaust than they let on
The ones who committed the Armenian genocide weren't appointed by the people at all, so there's a stronger case for separating the modern state from the empire
I would argue that, personally
Mussolini already tried making that true and it didn't work out
Jokes aside the Roman empire went on with zero Italian territory for a thousand years after the fall of Rome so I think it's silly to suggest Italy is its successor
In a presidential system yes
In a parliamentary system no
The presidential system is too open to abuse
They can lose the support of the legislature and still retain vast powers
A chancellor/prime minister that loses support is out on his/her ear

As I had to point out the last time this was posted, the wikipedia list this map was made from is unsourced and inaccurate
As others have said Glasgow and Edinburgh were not in any way founded by the Romans
Being Scottish those are the ones I'm aware are wrong, I'm sure many more are
Without sources to back it up this map is generally useless
The list is incomplete as well, so the "every" is also untrue
It's very sad to see false information being posted and believed yet again
In a lot of those cases I wouldn't say founded, rather that their introduction of infrastructure made the existing small towns/villages flourish
They built a lot of stuff here (UK) for a country they didn't even manage to hold on to
Also Prideful reminder that they never took scotland
Glasgow and Edinburgh weren't founded by the Romans
Also missing tons of other cities
pretty shit map
Even the Romans didn't want Dundee
But didn't America Guy come first
What an utter wankstain you are
Personally, I've been at university, so I have no ability to move despite wanting to
Hopefully Scotland gets another referendum
Scotland has free university for it's own students from Scotland, and for people from the EU
It's just the other parts of the UK that have to pay to go
Scotland voted to stay in the EU as a majority, and as a whole we tend to like the EU
I'm unsure of what the Scottish governments plans are post Brexit though, but I assume they're going to try to get another independence referendum to be able to return to the EU
And hello to the customary hordes of drunken British people
Those poor people

This does not look like somewhere that it’d be safe to walk after a few refreshments

I always head up Cockburn street when I'm going from the train station to pretty much anywhere on the south side
There's something nicely bracing about a steep hill climb after you get off the train
RIP Whiplash Trash though ;;
And it is a true representation of summer in Scotland - all cloud and no rain
Still think Glasgow should be capital
A bit like Kraków
Little in the sense it's younger perhaps, but by far the bigger city
>by far
It's only 100,000 more
Geographical size
The city limits of Glasgow are a bit less defined and can end up including much more people than Edinburgh
UK kinda letting the side down
To be fair, Oregon is one of the least affected states from the virus right
Bottom 5 I'm sure
I don't think the same precautions are being taken in a lot of other states
I don't have the EU as a whole, but I've got the USA and some European countries tracked in a table [here]
The USA isn't doing that bad at all compared to most of the large European countries, at least when it comes to deaths
But it will be best to look at the excess death figures when they're available
The FT has some excess death figures [available] and again things don't seem too bad in the USA, at least compared to the likes of the UK, Spain, and Italy
Although the data there is from a range of dates
But yeah, comparing infections and tests isn't particularly useful
Deaths are the best way, and excess deaths are definitely the best possible metric
Edit* I've also made this, which shows weekly increases in the above countries
I'm not sure if the USA has being testing more and more, but it is still quite shocking how their number of infections are hardly decreasing
Gotta conquer someone to have an empire

How are you sending wishes from two places

No problem, just peculiar
I guess it's down to how you like to identify yourself
I'm personally always a bit unsure about how to identify myself
Apple doesn't have the Scottish flag
I can't find it on android either
I guess I am Scottish since I've lived here the longest, more than 10 years
However I was born in the USA, lived in Canada and England, and to top it off my family is from Bulgaria like yourself
(I actually just came back from Sofia
) So even though I've lived in Scotland the longest I don't really identify as Scottish
at least not yet

What does that have to do with what he wrote
He wasn't making any statement about anything, just summarising the people in this thread
My mum, born in 1952, told me that she had no idea that homosexuality existed growing up
According to her, it was simply not talked about in the fifties and sixties, in the media or anywhere else, or if if was she missed it
She only realized the existence of homosexuality in 1969 when she was in London and hanging about with the hippies in Trafalgar Square (or was it Picadilly Circus) and noticed some young men who were entering and exiting the public toilets there strangely frequently
Why were these men frequenting the public toilets so much, she wondered
Why does France not surprise me
The legalisation of homosexuality takes the fun out of it for me tbh
Not in Scotland and Northern Ireland
Oh Italy
When I saw that originally, I thought it was a funny photoshop
But apparently not
In Germany you need a special permit to have fun and the quota for 2017 was already given away

Last year my mrs was in a private hospital in constanta and it was a very nice place, doctors were useless though
And then she was in the state hospital which was visibly comparable to the older hospital where we live in the UK
And a fridge
you would think
Both the Private and State hospital managed to miss a huge issue that was eventually solved when we made it back to the UK
To be fair though, the local older doctors practise in constanta did seemed to be a lot more on the ball
Apparently the older doctor guys are more in it for helping folk, but younger doctors just want to make money
They were allowed in specifically because France, the United Kingdom, and Germany wanted the expansion
However, all the member nations were against allowing free movement of those nations until significant advances had been made, to prevent mass migration
The UK, though, was desperate for new cheap labour, and spent months convincing the other nations to allow migration from E. European nations
And now it's Britain, my own damn country, protesting about "lazy eastern Europeans coming in and simultaneously being on the dole AND somehow stealing our jobs". Fuck I'm glad I moved to Australia, at least we're upfront about our severe xenophobia

During the 2014 campaign Unionist would try and argue that Scotland wouldn’t be welcomed into the EU or we would need to go to the back of an imaginary queue to join
Thinking back to some of the arguments they used is just laughable
They even threatened to put up a guarded border between Scotland and England

62% is a *far* larger margin than that being used to justify 'Brexit'.
Could you explain the inconsistency
Isnt the combined population of NI, Scotland and Wales around 10m?
62% voted to remain I would say it’s more pro eu
I like people like you, people like you and what you say and do are the reason Scotland will leave the UK

It's about 50/50, which was confirmed by the election results last week
If anyone tells you which way the election will go they are clearly not very well informed
Any of the arguments there were against Brexit are even more acute against Scottish independence
Scotland going it alone and hoping to rejoin the EU doesn’t present any reasonable prospect of economical benefits over staying in the UK
Most independence supporters argue (much like Brexiteers) that the economic pain would be worth it for more sovereignty
>I wouldn't be remotely surprised to find out in a few years that Sturgeon and Putin are connected
Absolute nonsense and insane that it's being upvoted
Cringe scene
England never colonised Scotland
I mean
yeah, because it's civic nationalism not blood and soil nationalism
It has more or less the same problems but worse, and largely relies on the same arguments and same reasoning - which sort of gives the sense that what's being said doesn't really matter
Though on /r/Europe it is less supported than on the American-dominated subreddits since a connection isn't made to the Trump psychodrama
A similar example is Quebec
They had two referendums with similar results in both and it seems to have put the issue to bed
It has returned and levelled out at its post brexit but pre pandemic levels
Right
In case you missed it salmond and Sturgeon hate each other now

I know in Ireland they don't like the term "British Isles" as it suggests that the island of Ireland is "British" in a national not just in a geographic sense, but imagine being lumped in with England all the time, as though you don't matter or don't exist, in the everyday speech of Americans and continentals alike
Imagine the chagrin
This diagram has some big mistakes
The island of Ireland is not considered part of the British Isles by people from there
The Channel Islands are not 'British Islands'. They are part of the historical region of Normandy, now in France
Not all of Scotland, Wales and England are on Great Britain
Scotland has more than 700 outlying islands
I just meant in terms of nomenclature, I wasn't referring to the union
They are part of the historical region of Normandy
Obviously they are not part of the modern French department

Kinda surprised this was stopped though given moving goods into North Korea should be as simple as stating China to be the final destination and then simply moving them on quietly from there
The Chinese Government aren't exactly coy about their support for North Korea, it's pretty much accepted that most goods entering the country are via the Chinese border but there isn't a whole lot anyone can do about that
Just the right amount for a good Friday night
Officially
Keeping the dictatorship sweet has been a Chinese policy for a long time and they've let through whatever is necessary to keep that fat bastard content and calm him down when necessary
I think he knows his country is relatively safe because a buffer zone is required between the USA and China though
Nobody ever seems to have proposed a good solution for that problem, I suppose Trump has in a way though by threatening to take the USA out of South Korea

I mean, legally speaking isn't Catalonia in the EU until the Spanish recognise them as Independent anyway
I mean I get the whole out of the EU thing but really, the circumstances under which they are effectively out of the EU only occur once Spain recognises their Independence and that isn't something that appears to be on the horizon and if it ever gets to that stage I have to imagine we'd be in a situation where there was a more collaborative relationship between the two governments
For the time being Catalonia will be treated as any other part of the EU because to the EU nothing has changed and the biggest voice demanding that will be the Spanish
basically what I'm  getting at is, by the time Catalonia actually finds itself becoming Independent and leaving the EU if it ever does, chances are it'll be dealing with a Spain far more amenable to helping it back in
In other words, "Catalonia is on the rag".
Yep, I'd prefer they played it smart, but Scottish independence *supporters* seem to have become kindred spirits with the Catalan independence supporters
They held a refferendum, and people who didn't want to vote boycotted it
Then they held a vote in parliament, and politicians who didn't want to be independent boycotted it
Not sure what else they can do
If every liberal boycotted the next US election, and Trump won with 90% of the votes, what happens there
Does Trump become president, or does nothing happen
Trump would become president because 90% of voters voted for him
That's what would happen
Catalonia is going to become independent because 90% of voters voted for it
That's what democracy is
No, I'm under no illusions about that but people saying Catalonia is leaving the EU as a result of this vote don't seem to get that nobody would dispute that more than Spain itself
Yep, the only real connection is catalonia supporting the yes campaign (one of very few "countries" to do so) in the lead up to indyref
This is some well done satire

Happy St Patrick's Day Ireland
Thanks for the passport and giving me an escape route from Brexitland
Alright not doing so good on the renewables but otherwise ireland seems to be pretty good
When did that happen
We're up for it
No sorry, when the population got to 4m.
Holy shit

Someone dropped the moon again god dang it
She was, but now in many ways she's the most fanatical of the brexiteers
Even Dominic Raab (the second EU exit Secretary to resign) admitted that remaining in the EU would be better than the worst case scenarios now being talked about
For some reason, May won't hear of it
She's determined to Brexit on any terms regardless of the consequences
She got the nickname "the submarine" during the remain campaign as she always disappeared whenever something important happened
Most people that I know think this is because she chose the remain camp as it was politically advantageous, but wasn't overtly campaigning for it as that would harm her standing with leave voters
As such, most of us have no idea what her real position is
Its pretty ironic watching people wearing nike shoes demanding statues of people associated with slavery get taken down
Thats not the point
People want to remove statues and whatnot of people who are associated with slavery while at the same time turning a blind eye to the current slavery that is propping up their lifestyles
If people actually cared about improving society their first move wouldnt be taking down statues

There's two types of Loot Boxes, Loot Boxes are things that you can buy to get extra content in your game and Loot Boxes that you win for free
They'll give things that you could potentially get an edge in the game, for example Call of Duty you could win better weapons via Loot Boxes, the problem with them is the Odds for some items that to get Rare in game content is so low that it can tempt people to pay for them as you do get Loot Boxes at the end of a round that are free but they don't great Loot so it will tempt to try and pay for them
With the rewards always being Random and Paying to Win said Rarer Items can easily be addictive, EA Games tried to call Loot Boxes "Surprise Mechanics" to a Committee in the UK government in 2018 and they were having none of it
There's been many times that kids have ran up crazy bills on their Parents Credit or Debit Card as they no idea what is going on
Older gamers like myself are on to this type thing and we hate Loot Boxes, we want rid of them because they can give an opponent a hidden edge as long as they don't mind paying thousands to get
I'm against it as it you should be able to unlock said content through the game but now that's rare to happen with EA in things like Fifa to the point where it would really tempt to buy some, at first you may think "What can it hurt it's only 9
99 for this box, I'll buy it once or twice and see what happens" the problem is that there's an addictive thrill to players for unlocking content in games so if you're not careful you end up with thousands of debt because of them

Your country as a whole voted to leave
Scotland voted overwhelmingly to remain
I'm not even a Scottish nationalist but Scotland was completely bullshitted in that referendum
Edit: spelling
Lol not with our post-independence deficit
I'm talking about the EU referendum not the independence referendum
If we're going to get technical, then yes the UK is a country but it is a sovereign state
England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are all separate countries
Separate countries with completely different cultures and different social, economic and political views
all being governed under a single political body
England has a population 10 times higher than any of the other countries in the UK
This means when it comes to voting, the UK gets what England wants (9 times out of 10)
I having nothing against England, this is not a matter of being childish, and I voted No in the independence referendum
All I'm saying is that there is a blatant flaw in 4 nations being governed by a single parliament, especially when one of those nations is far bigger than the rest, and that this ancient union was formed to stop us from killing each other hundreds of years ago
This is no longer the case and is it proving to be undemocratic and oppressive
Obviously not every city can have its own parliament and there is a certain degree of tolerance needed, but we're talking about different countries here
Aberdeen is not controlled by the SNP and labour have made gains in Edinburgh
You hit the nail on the head about 'Scotland doesn't get a say
' argument
The UK votes as a whole, all people's votes are equal (Scotland actually has a bit more MPs per capita) yet these people want the Scottish vote to be equal to the English vote
I despise nationalism on all levels, but I would vote for independence if there was indyref2 due to the result of the EU referendum
I am not convinced Scotland has a voice in West Minster
The result of the EU referendum was just so black and white
Edit: wording
I had assumed that the Erdogan vote was highly motivated by peoples religious ideals, those who want greater Islamic presence in turkey vs those who want it to be more secular
There may be joint overlap though, i have no idea on religious density per district
[no need to worry]
why would closing stations make it busier
there may be people going from a closed one to get on at an open one but that will not compensate for the people who are going 2 or 3 stops who choose not to use it now
Considering this is reduced trains and the underground carriages look pretty normal that would mean the stations being closed have reduced the people trying to use the tube
but i didn't ask about less trains
and a lot of people only get on for 2 or 3 stops
They all don't bother now
I'm against the death penalty, but it's times like this that I think we should be allowed to make an exception
As much as I’m left, and as much as I *now* support Scottish independence, I do not take The National as a particularly reliable source of unbiased factual information, much like I don’t do that with Fox News on the other side
The paper was set up during the Scottish Independence debate and has had that agenda ever since
As much as I’m sure I’d agree with much of its stance, because I am generally aligned, I wouldn’t bother reading some biased echo chamber
I'm in the middle of (hopefully) buying a flat, and I've had to repeatedly go out various things
My solicitor wouldn't accept a scan of my ID so I had to take that in person
They want to see the balance on my banking passbook up-to-date so I had to take that into the bank to get it updated too
Now they have decided that the address on my passbook being out-of-date is an issue, so I've emailed the bank to ask about that and they said I'd have to take it back in to get it done
I've replied asking if we can do it by post but will have to see about that
Plus when I was in Glasgow yesterday getting all this done I had to repeatedly ask for directions and speak to bus drivers about my intended journey
I'm finding this 'social isolation' next to impossible in the middle of purchasing a property

The overuse of "fascist" that Tankies are known for is really something else

When Scotland rejoins, can we have monorail please

I think a lot of people in the UK didn't want to fully leave, but have something like Norway in the EEA
But the EU wouldn't allow it ://
Apologies, I didn't literally mean in the EEA, we were trying to get something similar but with a stricter border
Yes, a lot of the voters were sadly mislead :(
Man really gonna break all the people in Scotland’s heart who pretend we’re Nordic

The US has been our closest ally for decades and we want to remain close with them
I really don’t see the issue here
I hope we do the same with CANZUK after we’ve finally left after abandoning them in the first place
Japan is another example-they are doing okay
>countries dont have "friends"
So why do people paint the EU as a friend
Because some Scots don't feel British, others do
Because I consider myself both
Nah but we don't want to be in a political union
America First innit
And poor Spain recorded almost 1000 new deaths over the past 24 hours, and are in line with the number of confirmed cases as Italy now :(

Surely one cannot say that the simple existence of a tall tower is detrimental towards a city
Cities can coexist with great history and modern development, like London, New York, and Tokyo, all great world-class cities
Warsaw doesn't even have that many skyscrapers in the first place, (only 8)
They're all located close to one another in the city centre (which is newer than most European centres due to bombing in WWII), so even if they are bad for Warsaw's cityscape you can go literally anywhere else and enjoy beautiful low-rises
Lastly, they're not even architecturally bad
Much better than the tower blocks they build in China, for example
I'd hardly call seeing a few more towers harming the harmony of a cityscape, which prior to the boom had only the single Soviet-built Palace of Culture and Science
I could explain why you don't have any friends

The world is rapidly becoming a scarier climate to live in
Thoughts are with the dutch today
Look, we already tried that with Ireland 4 centuries ago and it completely backfired
In what way is that not true
Its an opinion, i'm not saying that everyone believes that
Edit: I'm not saying more dangerous, just a scarier political and social climate in my opinion
I am more concerned with the rise of misinformation and radicalisation than anything
We have entered an era of social echo chambers becoming a breeding ground for hatred and unfortunately on occasions violence
Sure on paper we may be living in a safer society but the rise of random attacks based on politics or religion and the way that they are reported on just scares me
I'm just stating how I feel, I respect if you guys think differently
Y'all seem to be forgetting that being scared is an emotion
If the world is becoming scarier to me that doesnt necessarily need to apply to everyone
I dont understand why this has created so much discourse :(
iirc Sinn Fein in UK elections refuse to sit in Parliament but they still get a few seats every year

Dam son
This seems so huge that its hard to imagine that its feasible, but I wonder if a barrier across the Strait of Gibraltar will actually end up being built and used to generate insane amounts of electricity
The Persian Gulf and Red Sea are narrow enough to be dammed as well, potentially saving a lot of low-lying ground in the middle-East and southern Europe, though probably at huge environmental cost
Could we please have those dams also function as road & rail bridges
If you put a road on top of the dam, it'd technically be a bridge across the north sea and Boris Johnson would die of a pleasure induced aneurism

Thank you kind friend
Good choice of country
Just happy to be European for a little while longer :(
We will be again soon ;) keep the heid
Get us to fuck sooner rather than later
It’s kind of complicated
There’s this thing called the “Scotland Act of 1998” which basically states that the Scottish Parliament, Holyrood in Edinburgh, can’t pass any legislation which relates to any “reserved powers” which Westminster holds, including the existence of the Union
The only reason we got to hold one in 2012 was because we signed an agreement with the UK government called “Section 30” which temporarily gave us the power to hold one
We would need to get the UK to agree to another order, otherwise if we went ahead and had one without the UK’s “consent”, the ruling if turned in  favour of independence could be boycotted or blocked in the Supreme Court because it’s not technically legally binding
Sturgeon and the SNP are pushing to have another one before May 2021 but we would essentially need Boris’s consent to do so, and he’s said in interviews that he wouldn’t give his consent
So it’s going to be a tug of war for sure
Hope this makes sense
Sounds like a terminal disease
It’s just nice to feel included really :)
I can see the point, but a lot of people don’t consider themselves British, myself included

Thanks for reminding me to renew my passport early

Enjoy your downgrade
Oh yeah, every single one of us voted to stay in the UK, it was pretty much unanimous
What was it, like 98% No and 2% Yes
Yeah, my point is that you can’t just assume that Scotland as a whole voted to stay
Only 55% at the time did, which isn’t really enough of a majority to assume that any Scot you meet wanted to stay in the UK
Yeah, I know why it happened
I live in Scotland, you don’t have to explain it too me
I do agree with what you’re saying though

As someone born in raised in Scotland, the introduction of free tuition fees has been instrumental in my life
I'm only 19 right now bit come from a poor background and it's thanks to this that I'm currently in uni and doing pretty well for myself
Without it, I don't think I could have gone
Not necessarily true
Any UK residents (with the exception of Northern Irish students with dual citizenship), regardless of where they're born, are subject to the same residency requirements for free tuition in Scotland
You have to have lived in Scotland for at least 3 continuous years prior to your course start date
Someone born in England, moved to Scotland at 5, and applying for university at 18 will have their tuition covered by the Scottish government
Someone born in Scotland, moved to England at 5, and returning to Scotland at 18 to apply for university will have to pay full tuition fees
This is because England opted out of giving free tuition to EU students, so they lost it in turn for English students going anywhere else
Charge fees for visiting students to your country and your students will be charged equal fees when they go elsewhere
[Can anyone guess why
You will always be welcome here
Please wait for us - we will take that 27th member spot once England leaves
Not really, its a reciprocity thing
No, it's because the rest of the UK is not a separate entity in the EU with respect to Scotland
I need to pay tuition in Scotland because of some silly rules, and was upset about it  but it's only £1700 a year
I couldn't imagine paying £3000 a year never mind £9000
It's the sad Torification of the UK, unfortunately
You'll find people even defending it these days
Maggie's foul offspring have finally cracked them
We love you lads too
We might need some of that automatic French citizenship shortly - any chance
It's because we apply the same 3 year residency requirement for free tuition regardless of where you were born in the UK
Someone who was born in Scotland, moved to England at 5, and returned at 18 to apply for university will have to pay fees
Someone born in England, moved to Scotland at 5, and applying for university at 18 will get free tuition
It's based on a residency requirement, not where you were born, you need 3 continuous years residency in Scotland prior to your course start date
That would absolutely fuck them over
Another blatent dismisal of our devolved parliament
The Tory bastards
Yeah it could
Unfortunately the rest of the UK has succumbed to the right wing personality defect that makes them think it's a smashing idea to charge tuition fees
Until that is sorted out it's not likely they'll do so
St Andrews, Edinburgh and Glasgow are among the best universities in the UK, hence why lots of English people go to them
> We have the best universities though
No denying you have some amazing unis
> And student debt does not act like normal debt
**Everyone in the nation can afford it
That last part simply isn't true when you throw in the cost of living as a student
I'm planning on travelling when I graduate, if you guys can drink I'll be there

They're different constituent countries, but they're both in the sovereign country of the United Kingdom
There's nothing wrong with their comment, you're just misunderstanding it
Well you see, the reason we have it for free at the point of use is because our education is a devolved power meaning our government controls it and not Westminster
As we also tend to vote more left wing than the rest of the UK, we have the Scottish National Party as our government and they introduced it back in 2010
If the rest of the UK wanted free tuition fee (something politicians have promised them since we introduced it back in 2010 during pretty much every election) they would have to do it through the UK parliament
Wait, so you're saying because we have a devolved system that your politicians can't vote in, but you don't cause you have never voted for one (like we did) it's our fault your politicians don't give you free tuition
Whats that got to do with anything
Many people in working class backgrounds
Yes they can go and the loans are easily repayable once employed but the cost of living is too high for many
We represent a smaller percentage of the UK population but contribute a higher percent in tax, so not sure what you're talking about really
A constituent country is not the same thing as a sovereign country
They're saying that both England and Scotland are part of the UK (the same sovereign country), you're assuming that they're saying that both England and Scotland are the same constituent country
You're misunderstanding them
I myself am from a working class background and it is not misleading
Even with a higher maintenance loan and a job that pays me £9 per hour, I struggle to get by and that's at a uni with comparatively low costs
I encourage everyone who wants to persue education to do, I myself have worked hard to get to this point but I would be lying if I said it was affordable and the fact that tuition fees are paid was a huge motivator for me as it meant one less debt
Interesting
I'm guessing the Barnett formula accounts for a comparatively more dispersed and remote population, and the public spending implications that come with this
I'm going to go away and read up on this more though, cheers
> which is an objectively incorrect statement
It's not, because they're both in the UK, which is the same country
It's only incorrect if you wrongly assume they meant constituent country
I  work around 30 hours a week, I don't have a car, I have a strict food budget that I stick to, my rent is fairly reasonable and I have cut out all unnecessary memberships and such
I know I'm not alone in this either
Many of my friends work more hours than me and budget even better and still struggle
I mean I get by but just barely and as some people have suggested here that it's a great time to be saving and stuff, well that's just bs because pretty much most people I have met at uni are only just getting by
> Scotland, England, Wales etc
are referred to as 'countries'
Yes they are referred to as countries, but they're not sovereign countries, which is what the common use of country refers to
My loan just about covers my rent and I don't make over £1000 per month
Sovereign country is the common definition used when someone says country
It's incredibly rare that someone means constituent country when they say country, because it's not a common use
You're assuming they meant constituent, which is incredibly unlikely
I'm getting bored of this now, you're just being a pedant
You clearly understood what they meant and just want an argument
Feel free to shout into the abyss if you want
> Lmao, you're just being awkward now man
I'll just leave this map here
You're the one linking a "UK map" that includes Ireland
Fantastically accurate resource

It is, legally

Prefer the original roof, the roofline of the restoration looks off to me for some reason
Labour is kinda fucked
For all the praise for doing well in the election their voter base is split over brexit

I was under the impression that totally bombed and was effectively dead compared to Czech Republic
Gotta spend big and do big stuff if that's the desire
As it is ESA and NASA work very well together
NASA are going to be doing big stuff in the nearish future though, ESA will of course be involved in a lot of stuff as well but if public engagement is the desire then we need to be thinking much bigger
Manned flight and ambitious goals are the key imo
We need a Mars programme - we need someone to come out and do a JFK

I was thinking we were having a warm month
I guess it just doesn't feel that unusual because it's still cooler than the summer heatwave
It was 19°C here in Edinburgh, and I was coat free and still too hot
I'd think it's similarly coat free there
Yeah, then the Paris Commune happened and the rebels just built bigger barricades

It's misleading to suggest that we're imprisoned by Britain, we're not
Scotland has one of the few separatist movements which isn't illegal/suppressed/etc
Had we voted in 2014 to leave the UK then we'd have left
However the basic point is still true, as the government fucks Brexit up more and more the UK may disintegrate internally
Brexit is horrendously damaging
Scotland wants to be an independent country but we also want to join the EU
I personally prefer Caledonia
Me too
I didn't know that
I like it
Someone from NI complaining about Nationalism
LOL
Scotland is barely ‘part’ of Britain it has a small, meaningless voice within the UK parliamentary system and a limited devolved government which can have powers taken away from it on a whim of the UK government going from recent developments around its brexit bill
Very little Scots are proud Brits, if many at all, most no voters done so out of a fear for the future not a misguided sense of pride in an empire which has not been relevant for around 100 years
Yes but in 2014 Scotland was told the only way it could stay in the EU was to stay part of the UK
That probably had an impact on how people voted
And it isn't like Scotland voted to stay in the EU either
But we're apparently all oppressed by our Westmonster overlords
Fair point, but you could always leave if it has that much of an impact
Incorrect, most Scots are Brits by default and have little ‘pride’ in being British
Pride in historical contributions to the empire are of little relevance to independence arguments
Andy Murray actually revealed himself as a supporter for Independence on the day of the referendum
Some nats seem to act like we're oppressed
I have no issue if people want to argue that the union is not ideal the way it is
Everybody I know who wants Scottish independence is sitting and waiting to see what happens with Brexit
Hell, even the SNP are
I didn't mean nat to come across as derogatory
Apologies
> current arrangement isn't idea in achieving the kind of life they want
Agreed
In Britain the minister of health was recorded post curfew time in a bar, actually making jokes about abusing the current Covid-19 government support scheme, and nothing happened
This is how I feel lawmaking should be from time to time
I know endless debate and refinement is a good thing but sometimes a swift enactment like this can restore faith in the ability of government
I think this is great actually because it shows that democracy really works
Doesn't matter what the personal opinions are of the country's leader, if the majority vote for it, it happens
Vive le démocratie
Lang lebe die Demokratie

Kinda surprised the UK is so accepting of Muslims after the history the country has had over the past few years
Unless you're in Slovakia, which exists in a localised time warp where Hitler won the war, apparently
From anecdotal experience being from the UK I would say most people also don't think of Indians and Pakistani as Asian, just refer to them as Indian or Pakistani,
for some reason our media always labels them as Asian in news stories and statistics but there has always been varying amounts of backlash to that as well
ITT people arguing in their shared language about how their cultures are totally different and have been separated for 'thousands of years'. Hint - if you share a language with another country your cultures cannot have diverged more than 400 years ago
When you haven’t had a government in more than a year, you lose the rights to have a full time prime minister, I guess

Just want to add a video of a short livestream Count Dankula did from the European Parliament after the vote
He confirms that all, or as near as make no difference, of the proposed amendments to the bill have been rejected and in amongst the "what the fuck just happened" he raises a pretty interesting point: That these bills (or similar) have already been trialed in Spain and it absolutely ruined small businesses and cause Google News (a free news aggregate service) to pull out of the country entirely for the cheek of charging them to provide a free service - most importantly even after the trial ended Google News has still not returned to the country

Yep, I wouldn't be surprised if he tried again in 4 years
He might have persuaded enough of the CDU to back him by then, especially if Laschet fails and they want a clean break from the Merkel-era

Shame on OP for not including it (although a lot of maps data visualization software don't allow you to separate the UK, so I'll give them a pass)
On there it is Scotland 1
12, Northern Ireland 1
22, and England/Wales 1
Sadly not
Most statistics for England/Wales are grouped together by the ONS
Curious what the figures would show in Scotland for the percentage of support for the Euro, instead of looking at the UK as a whole
Scotlands no getting hot days
Meanwhile, it'll be 15°C in Abetdeen
(Just south of the nose of Scotland
it's gonna be 26 degrees here on Friday
Why has England stolen the UK flag for itself
Scotland looks far too happy
England’s flag should be  but at least you did the devolved countries so I like it
Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia are in Europe
Their eyes definitely seem a lot more weary than anyone else
Scotland is very different from both of those as we are an actual country
Just very excited to be separate from the UK on a /r/europe map
Whereas Scotland is a COUNTRY
>subdivision of UK
THOSE ARE COUNTRIES
The UK doesn't even have a fucking constitution, that hardly means anything

That is just false

Fantasy Europe - In a Tolkien sort of style
Hi /r/Europe
Ive been doing a few maps like this lately and thought some of you in the venn diagram of Europeans and map people might like this sort of thing
I've been having fun lately making Tolkien-ish versions of real world locations - last week I had a go at Scotland which you can see over [here] and New England which is [here] They're fun to work on, but sadly not overly accurate
Here's a few more pictures of this Europe map from my blog:

Edit: Thanks for the great feedback
And sorry for the places I missed out and various spelling mistakes
I tried to fix a few of these [here] - Now featuring Prague
If you're looking for a print of this map, you can buy one online [here
I love these but the random hills is just too much for me to swallow
I'd love this as a big print/canvas if it had more cities labelled
Regrets
There we go, Prague goodness:
There we go, Prague goodness:
In retrospect this was a stupid mistake to make
There we go, Prague goodness:
Sorry about that, I didnt spent much time on research and frankly I dont know mainland Europe that well - didnt mean to offend
Precisely
There we go, Prague goodness:
I agree, I missed Prague by rushing the whole thing - definitely not intentional
Prague is in now
True, could definitely have done things a bit more comprehensively
haha maybe, but they start to look samey after a while, my range is really limited
Was going to but would inevitably upset people who live in supposedly major cities that weren't included
Belfast and Cardiff should be there, and Edinburgh deserves to be there
Prague is in now
Prague is in now

In my defence

It's really sad that everyone had so much hope for Russia becoming a normal country when the Soviet Union collapsed

It's astounding how rubbish German espionage and intelligence was during the Second World War
They truly had no fucking clue what they were up against
>  I wonder if germany had any chance at all of winning the war in the east,
It really depends on the Soviet's willingness to continue fighting, or not
Even if Germany took Moscow, the Soviets had already evacuated most of the government to the secondary capital in Samara, and they'd keep fighting from there
The USSR was the size of Pluto, so needless to say it was virtually impossible for Germany to subjugate that country as long as that country was willing to keep fighting on
I had been led to believe that Kant never left Königsberg, but today I learned that's a myth
He went to Russia or Poland or somewhere, and also to Barcelona to hang out in the subway

Sandstone is difficult to restore as a lot of the techniques to lift dirt will obliterate detail
When they did the Art Gallery in Glasgow they sprayed the surface with liquid latex and peeled it off once it solidified, taking the dirt off but leaving the stone unharmed
I believe they started this in 2015, the museum was covered in scaffolding last June when I was in Prague and I had a nosey online to see why
Isn't it the case that with less air pollution nowadays, sandstone buildings get dirty a lot slower
Maybe it'll last 6 years
No worries, I'm just gutted that I can't find a picture of it in progress (there are some at the gallery itself and they are pretty cool)

Separate education for Scotland mind
Scotland and the rest of the UK should be separate since we have a different education system, as its a devolved matter
Scotland/Bolivia, here
They were famous in both countries
I've even got one in Scots
Yup, read the English translations
Even at its peak my French was never good enough to follow the originals though
Scot here, used to go down to my library every Saturday in the late 80's and pick up an Asterix or Tin Tin book alternately
It was a sad day when I read them all
I just remember our father reading these to me and my brother before we went to sleep when we were younger, good memories :)
Yeah but women *try* to commit suicide more ^^^^/s
Poland is Roman Catholic
Russia and Latvia are Orthodox Catholic
Sorry but you are incorrect
'Orthodox' is short for 'Orthodox Catholic'. That's the reason that the Roman Catholic church needs to specify 'Roman' in its name - the Catholic Church split into two parts during the Great Schism, and both parts view themselves as the legitimate Catholic Church
Orthodox Catholics are no less Catholic than Roman Catholics
The most unlikely scenario here is the EU having a working aircraft carrier lol

The suez crisis was a military victory by all accounts with the British, French and Israeli coalition achieving all their military objectives
Where it was not a success was in the diplomatic department
Pressure by both the united states and the soviet union eventually forced Britian and France to give up perusing colonial goals
>Mau Mau rebellion
Again, The Mau Mau rebellion was crushed and did not achieve it's goals
Kenyan independence was achieved by different means
You could have found this out by spending 30 seconds on wikipedia
It's literally in the first couple paragraphs of the Mau Mau rebellion article
Kenyan independence was achieved years after the mau mau's dissolved
Here we see the Irish Nationalist emerging from his den
He can sense anything that is remotely positive or even neutral about the UK from over 500 miles away and set out to destroy it
The British achieved exactly what they set out to do but in the end conceded their gains in order to maintain cordial relations with two world superpowers
Perceive that as you will but in my eyes it's a victory
Well, that's just untrue
The UK played a major role in the allied victory
If not for the UK there would have been virtually no Western Front after France was defeated
Even though fighting was heavier on the Eastern Front, fighting on two fronts was highly detrimental to German success
Also, the Normandy Landings could not have went ahead without the UK as a base nor without Britain providing nearly half of the man power
I'm not arguing that the US or the Soviet Union had the largest parts to play in an allied victory, but to say the UK was 'unimportant' is nonsense
It is pretty much true, at least in the sense that I've never had a good tomato north of that line, nor a bad one south of it

This is the special American definition of socialism, which is "the state doing literally anything, except its proper "limited government" roles of giving money to the military so they can build boondoggle helicopters and kill people with drones, and devising tax breaks for the richest
This can't be real, someone in the US must be hammering out a hell of a media campaign if Venezuela has been so specifically named as number 2, and socialist China

RIP my right to go and settle and work in another EU country with minimal paperwork
Amazing aha
and we can already see a lot of them moving on already
It's really quite petty, if only England would see that the manner in which the EU is dealing with Brexit is the same manner in which England dealt with Scotland
I want to remain with England but I want Ireland to be united and Wales to do what it desires and us all to work together as equals, but if England can't be adults about this then fuck 'em
I love Arnhem, been twice now and it's a beautiful city with really friendly people

Scotland and Ireland the only two countries entirely tertiary
Great form from the lads
Should point out that Scotland is commonly University and college level education because we don't have tuition fees for Scots here
Mon the Scotland
We are smart as fuck
It's hard to compare these things across countries
Scotland has no vocational high schools so people tend to leave high school a year or two early and go to college for a year if they want a vocational career
You can leave school at 16 in Scotland and be finished college before you turn 18
So tertiary education doesn't actually mean they are any more or better educated than if they went to a vocational high school and left at 18, as I believe happens in Germany for example
Have a look at this mean years of schooling for comparison, it tells quite a different story:
You can be a zoo keeper in Germany by an apprenticeship

I mean, that's pretty much been the Conservative party line ever since the EU became a thing
I get that the dithering is annoying but normal people are gonna get fucked up because of political games
> but I dont think you match their population minimum to join the EU yourselves, so you still wouldn't be able to
Out of the current member states Ireland, Croatia, Lithuania, Slovenia, Latvia, Estonia, Cyprus, Luxembourg and Malta all have smaller populations than Scotland, with Malta being the smallest at 475, 701 (according to their last official estimate in 2016)
So I think we'll be fine in that regard

Malnourished chubby kids everywhere
Britain can look forward to this
The eggs are washed because they can be have excrement on them
Because there is no need to vaccinate chickens in the US, this (along with the actual egg itself) can contain salmonella and can therefore lead to contamination of other foods
The eggs must therefore be washed and refrigerated
In the EU, there are requirements around vaccination of chickens, so salmonella infecting eggs is unusual
I remember seeing a Ukrainian tank with the slogan "Happy Holidays" sprayed across the front, for all those Russian holiday makers who had invaded their country completely by accident
The Lederhosen stereotype is well-known in the UK, just because it's an obvious way of delineating Germans from other people by their dress in cartoons

> They're free to change their mind any time as stated in the GFA
Sure, as soon as the Secretary of state for Northern Ireland decided based on their "feelings" that opinions have changed and calls a border poll
The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is a west minister cabinet members that is literally appointed by the monarch
Very wide interpretation of "they" and "whenever" there isnt it
You're right its on advice from the prime minister but they are still the one to approve it
So it cant be called whenever the people of Northern Ireland want and the only way its called for is by a man chosen by the head of the UK government
You arent getting my point, its a person selected by the *UK* who have a vested interest (Conservative and *Unionist* party for example) in refusing a border poll, its not a Northern Ireland representative which would make it "them".
>  then that would be the basis for calling a referendum
But there is literally no mechanism to force one if the secretary for state didnt "feel" that opinions have changed
That is true even if every poll stated otherwise
This is counter to your "whenever" claim
(didnt respond as your edit was after my reply)
I dont really follow what that has to do with the claim that they can call one whenever they want
> The "want" is determined by the polling information I have provided
What
"Whenever they want" is restricted by the *ability* not the desire
The entire issue is with them being able to
> A refusal to act on a swing in public opinion would definitely reignite the Troubles, which nobody wants
Which is still not "whenever they want" because it requires a third party ie the UK government through the Secretary of State to call the border poll to allow them to vote to leave the UK
I made no comment on opinions or what refusing would cause, I commented entirely on the restrictions within the GFA for NI alone to decide to leave the UK
The big mountain range going through it makes it weird
Also in the past everyone in romania lived in small towns of around 1000 people where the neighbours didn't.
Most dots in the west coast of scotland arent cities, just small towns and i think its fairly accurate
The Highland Council area is larger than Belgium and has 230k people (with about 70k of them living in Inverness)
Scotland has 8% of the UKs population, 7% of this poll is negative to the UK

it’s extreme, because taking such a strong view of _half the country_ is really harsh, and I think it’s unlikely that half the country are as bad as people seem to present Brexit voters as
I mean fundamentally Brexit was about whether the U.K. would be better in or out of an economic union, it’s not like Brexit voters really did anything that should be insulting to Europe
At this point the government are more the ministry of silly wanks
> The EU, almost since its beginning, has been neoliberal
So, yes, it's aligned to parties on the right
One of possible good outcomes of the UK leaving is that Tories (or Blair like Labour) won't have the excuse of "we implement austerity because of EU rules", they'll have to own it
Except without the restraint and protections offered by the EU, meaning that the general citizenry just get fucked harder
So no, not really a possible good outcome
Anything’s an aircraft carrier if you’re brave enough
Reminds me of Scotland
Exactly
Spain and Italy are thicc
The UK looks so tropical, a shame it’s not true
A majority of the JURI committee is in favour of it
you actually think that will do something
Thank you :)
Believe it or not we still care about Europe very much
Thanks for the love
I'm grateful my Grandfather was from Ireland
I'm in the process of applying for Irish citizenship
The United Kingdom has certainly split down the middle with this decision
Things are going to be very interesting over the next few years
It's also perfectly ok to tell the UK to go fuck itself
You don't have to be polite to a country which spat on you and is willing to break the GFA just to feel superior
Just remember that a lot of us - probably a majority now - don't want Brexit anyway
Many of us are bewildered, angry and very very sad about the whole thing
Keep the door open for us
Hopefully we'll be back soon
To my European friends, from a Eurosceptic Brit (that still managed to see the big picture, and vote Remain)- this is now how these last 3 years should have been spent
I can sympathise with those that voted leave, I really can- and as someone that almost did, let me tell you that it is not with any animosity to the people of Europe
The world is a scary and confusing place, and everything is changing so quickly
The smaller things pushed me away from the EU, and I still have my gripes with those today- but the big picture of Pan-European peace, trade and cooperation was and is worth it
Even given the vote to leave, I think we should have done so in an orderly fashion
But leave orderly or chaotically, be rest assured that the 48% will create a pro-European movement that this country hasn’t seen before
Because we are European
"Sick of all these two-faced snakes
"U ok hun

I was more meaning the mainland but both works
Aww thanks
Germany is also lovely :)
Constitutional Issues: Section 3:
>it would be wrong to make any change in the status of Northern Ireland save with the consent of a majority of its people
Brexit tells the majority of Northern Ireland to go fuck itself
Which is, by its own admission, a constitutional issue that the GFA explicitly set out to avoid
By purposely doing something that the GFA says not to do, they are breaking it
The majority of N.Ireland voted remain
Brexit changes the status of N.Ireland, especially in relation to Ireland, without the consent of a majority of its people
This part of the GFA is being ignored and Brexit is happening without their consent
Which is the same as telling them to go fuck themselves
You can disagree with this characterization, of course, but in my opinion its an accurate representation of the UK's attitude towards N.Ireland
Though ultimately how we characterize the UK breaking the GFA is irrelevant
All that matters is they're breaking the GFA
Fingers crossed
Ireland has been well supported in /r/scotland
Or, y'know, the UK could just stop dicking about and pointing in the finger
And Brexit is a change in the status of N.Ireland in relation to Ireland, which is what the GFA is about, without the consent of a majority of its people
This doesn't encapsulate "any legal change or foreign policy decision" because the GFA doesn't cover that
It convers the status of N.Ireland and Ireland relations, and any change in that against the will of the majority of N.Ireland breaks the GFA
Not sure how you can say "No" when its spelled out for you in plain English in the source you linked mate
Summer can get to fuck
This is not the year to be putting up with its usual horseshit
anything above 20°c is just too hot for me
And I'm not happy
It's awful
Please turn it off
It got to around 29° here in my area at about 6pm and I was dying
Fuck off 26 degrees is too fucking hot
We had thunder and lightning this morning, then like 24°C sun in the afternoon, then thunder and lightning + heavy rain in the evening
A confusing day all round
As a Scot heading out today as pale as anything l, headed back being red as anything
It's way too hot for me
Yellow crew here 18 degrees with a cool breeze
Perfect
I'd say 15-20 is perfect
Too hot already
Up north it's 18 degrees with a fresh breeze
Perfect
So Scottish summer weather
Jokes on you north of scotland is never hot
18 with a cool breeze it's kinda nice
Not bad 18 and a cool breeze across the moral firth
That's the definition of hell for me
I despise winter
Cold but wet
Everything goes grey like the clouds
It's dark when you go out in the morning and when you get back after work
Extra heating bills
Can't ever get my hands and feet warm
Amplifies the depression 10x.
I'll take hot summer every time
And there's no way 32% is true
A lot of those people are lying
I feel like we all know this will inevitably end with either the bridge/tunnel between Denmark and Sweden, or the Falkirk wheel in Scotland
The Lion turns into a house-cat, and neither Dragons or Unicorns will exist after Brexit
Potato farming will be fine
Thank you, John Knox
By the time of this data, the HRE hadn’t been a thing for the last 100 yrs
Is erosion/subsidence much of a problem there
How do you get the blue things next to your name
Thanks
Next year, I hope you have one
I had to Google it too so no problems in transition
Greece had a 48
I'd probably unironically die of heatstroke
I had problems in the 27° yesterday
I'm sorry, it was 30C in Iceland
I was pouring with sweat working today and it's only 23c or something
I don't know how anyone gets anything done in these hot countries
I went to South East Asia and people kept asking me if I was okay because I was such a mess due to the heat and humidity
Yeah here in Scotland I'm the same
Anything 20 degrees or higher is too hot for me
Pretty much everyone would
I doubt it
I don't remember hearing about "pretty much everyone" in Athens dying of heatstroke in July 1977
England might, Scotland and NI definitely won't
Yeah exactly, this stops the local government ever having to clean the beach of picnic stuff
Nice and all but if you're using an Android device then more than likely you've pretty much given up to Google in terms of privacy already
Of course users should have choice but it's kinda like pissing into the wind for the average user of the average Android smartphone
Good location + educated and trained population
The same things that made Germany rich and developed before the world wars, still existed after the world wars
Germany is smack in the middle of Europe, and riddled with navigable rivers that allow for transportation of goods to all of its neighbours, so that's already a big plus
Add the fact that the engineers, businessmen, operators, etc
who built Germany's industry were still alive after the wars, and they could (relatively) easily pick everything back up and put it back together
Please add Scots "Snaw" (pronounced /snɑː(w)/ in the north and /snɔː/ everywhere else) which interestingly enough is the same as the old english word
You shouldn't even be allowed onto this map, consider yourself lucky
>In reality it will lead to Nigel Farage's Brexit Party winning nearest elections like they did in the EU elections
Not a chance
It'll split the Right-wing vote and guarantee a Labour (probably coalition) government
But depending how far east you go it might be cheaper to just buy tickets
While being from Scotland and utterly hating the tories it's important to note that the Tories went further with this law than the EU by pushing it out to more than just large companies, it was also pushed to pubs and small companies
Not their thing however they did expand on it
Pretty common opinion around here
But they're cunts
The Tories
A bunch of cunts
BBC let them away with it too - I saw this on the TV news and not once was the EU directive mentioned
Pretty common opinion around here
But they're cunts
Make that sausage square and I think we might be into something magical
And if they don't understand, we proceed to repeat exactly what we just said only louder

Name of the femboy
From Glasgow
And I love this
fortnight battle royal
I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again
It’s a shitty Glasgow
When I was there i heard they put a child in a small tunnel underneath the city with a drum so they knew where he was, he died under there
Some can still hear him beating
I think transpotting takes place in Glasgow
I know the first scene is in Edinburgh but I think the rest is in Glasgow
I can’t really imagine that stuff happening there but it seems like it could happen here
This gives me a massive erection
They smart
[No
It's much more complicated than that
The treaty of the union happened because Scottish politicians were bought
The East India Company in England wanted to maintain a monopoly on trade so they forced financial backers to withdraw from the Darien scheme and threatened legal action
When the colony failed the lowlands was left in financial ruin, including the members of the Scottish parliament, who recieved a financial payoff, land and power for helping to pass the act of the union
Finland, because nothing would change
Britain (after Scot Indy though ;) )
What would happen if I said England
Jk i don't have anything against England but Scotland would get more attention that way
UK here, we've already nuked ourselves out of the EU via stupidity
So us
Second choice France, because obviously
Can we take this opportunity to do England while we can
The Netherlands: in a decade they will have fully reclamed the area, and will probably be twice the size and thrice as awesome
England just England not Wales or Scotland just England
England
There used to be
You know
when France and the uk claimed north Africa
Perhaps, Scotland primarily voted to remain if I remember correctly, so then we may get to just say "hey Europe, we didn't want to leave, mainly England, so we're just gonna stay" and the EU would only leave behind a drowned, nationwide Atlantis
Nah, just let the whole thing burn, we're a stupid island
That's exactly the point of that comment
Wholeheartedly disagree on the former there pal
Scotland just became the first country to make tampons free for all that need them
What unique progressive laws does your country have
We haven't done that yet
The bill only passed it's first reading in parliament
Jesus, this is the third time I've had to explain this
Have they actually done it yet
I heard about it a while ago but I didn’t know it had been put in place yet
surely that’s being quite late to the party
The great retreat
Stalinism was a confusing time
In Scotland if a disabled person is hired, if a charity helped them apply for work, the government pays part of the wage
I guess kinda similar
Isn't more that you can't be punished with extra prison time if you escape because of the right to seek freedom
It's similar to once the bill goes for reading in the lords because the committees are weak they almost always pass the laws
But you are right it needs to go for more readings
What type of progressivism do we need then
>So hownis it fair and just to make something free that only 50% of the population need
You could put that towards anything
Imagine 50% of people in a country didn't have clean water
That would matter, wouldn't it
From my understanding it is available upon request, so for example, you ask at a pharmacy for it
What's your problem on helping other people
I worked it out and the law would only cost £9
26 per tax payer
I was told that that is less than what alot of women pay for sanitary products in a month
It's all for a greater cause
It means free **at the point of use**.
Generally this only needs to be explained to Americans
Slovenia's novelty was making privatisation of water unconstitutional
... and we're *well* behind Sweden
so they were the first but also the sixteenth
don’t get me wrong, it’s a great move
Many young girls miss school because of periods
If people miss school, then obviously unemployment rate goes up and overall poverty goes up, meaning more tax actually has to be payed in the long term to help these people
So actually, even for you (I presume your a libertarian), it's cheaper in the long term
It will cost £25 million a year in Scotland
That is only £9
25 per taxpayer per year
I've been told that is less than what alot of women pay in a month for sanitary products
Why do you think girls choose to skip school because of periods
They would really rather not
Actually I didn't, you edited your comment after you posted
I simply didn't see it
Women wouldn't choose to have periods if they could
But unfortunately, it's a natural process
Don't use the equality card here for a natural process
They shouldn't be punished for *being women
Periods decrease equality between genders, and by making tampons free and reducing the impact of periods, it actually closes the inequality gap
It means all young girls can go to school and enjoy life, just like men
Just to remind you it's only for the price of a Domino's pizza
Probably irrelevant, but I am saying this as a man
First of all, men have no such natural process
Women have a pretty hefty process to deal with
So naturally, there is an inequality
Then,
Remember, it's not just the West that exists
Although even if you count the West:
Big time bad fuckin news
I'm with you, OP
Hoping that this is the moment at which the balance tips finally and definitively towards Scottish independence
I fear for the damage he will do in the meantime, but frankly Hunt is just as bad
Rory Stewart being defeated before the final round was a loss to the UK, but perhaps a gain for Scotland
Yeah, um
Fuck
Though this might bring about a general election but honestly I don't think that would really solve anything as I doubt there will be any outright majority and I don't trust Jeremy Corbyn with Brexit either
As another Scot, I'm disappointed that another countryman would use a phrase such as 'low-key happy'
It doesn't mean anything
Low
Key
? What the fuck is that supposed to mean as an adverb or whatever the fuck it is
Also as a Scot I see your point
However I'm worried about the rest of the UK
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK
That sums it up
I support independence, but our closest neighbour setting itself on fire benefits no one
I can see him doing immense damage to vulnerable people throughout the UK before we're through with this shite
Fuck
Hope that’s stupid, fat, Tory bastard crashes and burns and makes the biggest mess he can for the same reasons as u and for Scotland to get their independence
She wasn't handed a shitty hand, she reached and desperately grasped the shitty hand, just so she could get her taste of power
She didn't cry at the Grenfell memorial, she didn't cry for the Windrush generation deported to die far from home in a country they'd never been to before, she didn't cry when it was revealed austerity measures and universal credit failings were literally killing people on our streets
She cried for herself when she finally lost her job though
Fuck her
I'm guessing the Belgian attitude was:

This sounds rather familiar
Only country that ever lost its independence to an accounting error
I don't drink but uh sure
Quite a large percentage of people in this country live in poverty unfortunately
Poverty in Scotland means living in a shoddy 70s council flat on a sink estate in the central belt, working minimum wage which really isn’t nearly enough, being in debt, having to choose between essentials like food or heating, basically being fucked over by society in ever way, and having very poor health
My dad grew up very poor in the East end of Glasgow and both his parents died before 65, meanwhile my mum, who was raised
in the posh Edinburgh Southside has parents alive and well in their 90s...
Nothing that hasn't been said here already
You live in an ugly 70s flat, your friends probably just drink booze for recreation on your free time, your diet is shit and your parents are probably overweight due to it, etc
You get given £260 minimum every fortnight, and are given subsidies that help pay your rent for accommodation
You can get more for interview clothes, or if you have dependants
You use that money to buy designer clothes, cigarettes, and your favourite football teams latest top which looks suspiciously like their other ones
You then claim the government doesnt give you enough
Remember that documentary type thing ross kemp did with the guy whos toes rotted off
Some council houses and tenements are actually quite nice, believe it or not
Some of the council estates, like the ones in Dundee, were built about 100 years ago specifically to house the working classes, and they are actually alright
And even if you live in a big posh house with a mortgage, you won't escape the depressing effect of the climate
> overty could be not being able to afford quality health care
How does healthcare work in Finland
I'm surprised this is an issue
The UK has many issues with inequality, far worse than anything in Finland, but at least the NHS will never turn away anyone, regardless of their financial situation
Yes you are right
It’s called the ‘Glasgow Effect’. No one knows exactly why it happens but it’s probably just a result of many factors such as poor diet, poverty, high alcoholism, drugs, poor exercising, smoking, etc etc
Sorry what
His toes fell off and he kept them on top of his telly
(extreme world s2 e3)
That clears things up
That's kind of what it's like with the NHS in England (NHS Scotland is better imo)
You can use private insurance if you want to, and many people opt for that
67 is still shocking, but not quite 54
Yes
I couldn’t be happier with my accent
(Unless I was Irish, they’ve also got awesome accents)
No, it's kind of stuck half way between Scottish and Irish with a good bit of English mixed in
I've lived in too many places
I think about half the Spaniards I've met speaking English either have a fairly distinct accent and the other half are pretty much indistinguishable from UK locals
And yeah, accents don't really matter much tbh, there's really no need to alter them if people understand you (which matters far more on the quality of your English than the accent you have)
Given that there is no proper accent for English, basically so long as your English is understandable (and that typically depends more on better grasp of the language than accent unless you are grossly unlucky) it really doesn't matter
Given the spread of native English accents (plethora of UK, Australian, US, South African, Jamaican, etc accents) and accents from immigrant populations (Indian, Pakistani, Caribbean) no one is going to through a wobbly because you sound a bit German
Be a bit sterile and off if everyone spoke in the godawful RP accent
Eh, we have accents and dialects
Even dialling back local dialects (say, very Scots infused Glasweigin or lowland slang), you'll still have a distinct and different accent from say, someone from the North of England, or the South of England, or even the Highlands, all speaking Queen's English but sounding different
You can say all the same words but it'll come out different because your accents will make you pronounce them slightly differently (including stuff like whether your local accent is rhotic or not)
Given there isn't really a singular 'correct' English accent to aspire to and emulate (RP tried to be that, but I think most Northerners and Scots pretty distinctly hate it for sounding fake and unnatural), accents don't much indicate lack of mastery of the language (and indeed, I think the Germans I've met with the worst English tended to be the ones with a plain southern English accent that had clearly been bought at the expense of actual proficiency in the language)
Glasgow - It used to be a city of industry and was at the heart of the Scottish enlightenment
Nowadays it's just full of drug addicts, any of its former glory is long since gone and is now just a crime hub
They try to say that "people make Glasgow" but that's the kind of thing you say when your city is shit
If Towns were included then I'd say Falkirk is slightly worse, but since its Cities
It's probably Edinburgh, all the buildings and architecture are beautiful but it's got a reputation of having no culture
Not a city but a county
Fife, it’s not even really a bad place it’s just the place everyone in Scotland automatically thinks of when they want a place to bully
The think everyone always says about them is that they all have 3 toes and their mum is their sister
Or Edinburgh simply because it’s about 70% English people now and is the least scottish place is Scotland
Only one of these is a city but Scotland doesn’t have a lot of cities, just big towns
Edinburgh, Stevenson, paisley, ardrossan, Saltcoats, Irvine, kilwinning, FIFE, Kilmalcolm, Coatbridge, all of East Kilbride, Livingston and finally fucking port glasgow
Glasgow, Scotland
Full of alcoholism, heavy drug use, violence and homelessness
On top of all that its filthy
The amount of trash just laying around is shocking
I don't see why anyone would spend their money to come here, especially tourists
It's a shitehole
Gelsenkirchen was not an impressive place at all
I stopped in Malmö on the way back from visiting my friend in Lund
I stumbled open a "Scottish" bar - literally the only one I have ever seen outside of Scotland
I didn't know that was a *thing*, I'm just used to it always being Irish pubs
I thought Turku was rather pleasant when I was there, Valkeakoski was much more grim
That's ridiculous
Glasgow is so much more than a city full of drug addicts and a 'crime hub', I don't know how you are even claiming such a thing
There are bad parts sure but it's still a fantastic city to live in with much to see and do
Spoken like a true Edinburgh wanker
Glasgow cant be fixed no matter what they do, Aberdeen is boring I'll grant you but at least its safe and isnt dirty
I've only been to Paisley once, the centre seems alright but cant vouch for the rest
I have the misfortune of living rather near Falkirk so we have to see it ruining our views down the Forth Valley
We're each entitled to pur own opinions
I just find Glasgow drab, dirty, and full of undesirable people
Even the nightlife is pretty grim
I'm not saying its devoid of hope, but it's not somewhere I would recommend to someone visiting
I'm not from Edinburgh
Good
I dont want you to hate it
I'm glad you liked it
I'm not trying to dissuade anyone, just giving my personal opinion
I feel Scotland has alot to offer foreign visitors, but just personally dont think Glasgow shows our country in the best light
Alot of them put on an accent that isnt even remotely Scottish too, they think it makes them endearing but it's just really annoying
Apologies I didnt see the other comment, I found it interesting that Finland has lots of nice smaller towns and cities, maybe not scarred by immense industrialisation
Put on
Not remotely Scottish
Mate you need to expand on this because this is definitely a lot of shite
I have no trouble believing that, theres a reason the locals call it Mordor
When Glaswegians speak normally versus when they speak for an audience is completely different
Used to be "got stuck behind a tractor" when I lived in a more rural area, now that I live in Glasgow "trains were late/scotrail was as on time as ever" usually works a treat as our train system is late, always

That’s why I prefer to bike to work

The concept of league titles and fair competition in football has been rendered meaningless
Might not seem important right now but honestly its the thing that has me the most stressed
And before anyone says;
Football does fucking matter, to a great many people
No Im not a Rangers fan
What's happening with it
I've not been keeping up with the football
So there was meant to be another 8 games left in the season, but due to Covid they won't be played
Three facts are important here; Celtic didn't yet have enough points to win, Dundee Utd never had enough points to win the championship, and Hearts and Partick thistle both had more than enough of a chance to avoid relegation
All that being as it is, Dundee Utd have been given a league title they never won, and Partick have been relegated
In the coming days Celtic will be given a title they never won, and Hearts will be relegated
To me, the fact that Cetic and Dundee were "probably going to win" is irrelevant
As is the fact that Hearts etc were "probably going down". We might as well just give Celtic all the league titles for the rest of time and never play another game of football again
No reasonable person could possibly think this is fair, and all the clubs who voted for it are selfish bastards
Is that a challenge
Alba or Caledonia
Alba is the Gaelic word for Scotland, and I don’t know exactly how old it is but a brief skim of Wikipedia says it was in use around 1100 years ago
Caledonia was the Latin word for Scotland, and is still used as a kind of poetic name for the country
Dugald seems to have fallen out of fashion
Morag, or Eric
Fergus
It's a good name but it'll always make me think of some old, hairy, kilted highlander who spends too much time with his sheep
Dinnae bump into too many Angus's but
Fucking loved when we had an English teacher in who couldn’t pronounce the Irish and the Gaelic names
Especially when they badly mispronounced them

Caledonia is such a beautiful word

Albania also takes the most cocaine second one to Scotland

(I can speak all of them)
Videogames are for kids
For some reason, a lot of people in my city tend to know little or none about videogames, my parents and many others in my city still call them 'computer games' like back in the 80's. I think it's because parents really only tend to see their kids playing videogames and never see anybody else beside their kids friends playing them, so they think games are like toys for kids just how Action Man or Barbie is
So when they see an adult on a bus with a Switch, it's like they seem them as a manchild
Don't get me started
I saw one that said that Scottish Independence supporters are anglophobic (hating of English people)
I have no problem with English people (that would be racism if I did) but it's the political system I hate
That our problems were caused by the EU and immigrants, not by shitty British governments that only cared about London and the top 10%.
Go to Glasgow and it's a crapfest, Politicians don't care about anywhere outside London
I love immigrants also btw, they deserve a chance to build a career and live here in Scotland
Immigrants aren't to blame for the decline of this country, it's those stupid politicians that don't care about the rest of the UK at all
My Doric is extremely rusty, so I’d love if somebody who still knows it and speaks it could answer this
This is my favourite one, the cadence is very tolkienesque
Yes, but it's unlikely to happen, there's too much money at stake
Also, the thought of wearing a kilt in the Gulf heat is nightmarish
But it's probably all moot - I don't think Scotland will qualify
Scotland is one step ahead on this, we probably won't even qualify just to be sure
Yeah I mean Scotland has been boycotting world cups for ages now
Qatar shouldn’t even have been able to bribe the judges in order to get the World Cup
No country should be allowing a country with their human rights records or working conditions to be allowed to participate on the world stage in this manner

Players then proceed to shake hands and hug during a goal celebrations and at the end of the game
Ah, him
His latest effort has been to ask questions in Westminster about the mechanism for ending the SPFL season
Quite why this should matter to a Northern Irish MP, or why he should raise it in Westminster when culture and sport are devolved matters, is beyond me

Unless Holyrood becomes the only recognised competent government with northern Ireland deciding being part of greater Scotland is better than its other options
um, not really
It stands out more than other European countries for me, because its a relatively large island which sticks out
I'm disappointed no Icelandic people have said "yes" yet
So you go for your country's first then
Yeah ads for charities like water aid, and save the children
The ads do exist, though they aren't quite as frequent now as they perhaps once were
I wouldn't put them to blame as the reason for the widespread ignorance and misunderstandings regarding Africa, which probably lie in more deeply rooted cultural creations that have existed for at least a few centuries
Achebe's writing are pretty good on the whole debacle, usually using Conrad as an example of the propogandising of Africa to serve European imperialism and other ideologies (Said's Orientalism, using caricatures of non-European states and cultures to define and reinforce the self comes to mind as well)
Such a history of systemic and purposefully misinformation regardint Africa and Africans, plus a general apathy and ignorance to the continent in the present gives rise to the painful beliefs some have of the continent
Systemic propogandistion of the African other and the so called 'Dark Continent' so as to justify European slavery and colonisation likely did not help
Chinua Achebe and Edward Said would suggest this is something purposefully constructed a long time ago, and we see at present the unfortunate echoes of the past in how Africa is portrayed, influenced further by contemporary interests (spectacle in news hardly helps, where tragedy and suffering in Africa becomes all that is shown in many foreign news reporting, as that is what sparks interest in the viewers)
I’m a native English speaker but was very amused to learn the West Scottish word thunderplumps ie ‘it looks like thunderplumps later on’, meaning a heavy shower of rain is due
I'm a big Harry Potter fan but can't watch Americans (or even English) people talk about it on YouTube for the way the mangle some of the Scottish or Irish names
Especially Scrimgeour
Loan words aren't really straight up changed
Some words evolve over time and some don't.

Well Sheumais (Pronounced Hamish) is just the lenited version of Seumas, so your name is still Seumas but you would say ‘Madainn mhath, a Sheumais’ (Good Morning, Seumas ) when speaking to Seumas
I’m pretty sure Irish also has lenition aswell but I’m not entirely sure
The day before yesterday is ereyesterday, it's a shame they're not in use anymore
Or Kirkcudbrightshire (Kir-coo-bri-shir)
Yeah I'm in Scotland so like, I'm used to seeing Gaelic names and the like
I went to uni classes in a building named Scrymgeour
It pains me so much
But then so does JK calling it a lake
Or her shitty transphobia
I can see that lol
Oh yes
Yeah
Saddly it is
My dad is very much a british nationalist, british for the british, fuck foreignors, kick everyone out except the whites - you get the idea
He goes on holiday abroad every year, to places like cyprus, turkey, greece, etc
He gets very annoyed when theres germans where he goes (you know
to holiday resort complexes
where everyone is allowed
) he always grumbles about them
He used to live there and speaks a little German so its really suprising to me that he still hates them so much
Bonus: he also thinks the Germans are still trying to take over the world but have learnt from previous tries, as in the world wars, that they cant do it by force
He thinks theyre slowly trying to taking over everything, making themselves the leaders of the EU to get into higher power then make themselves the leaders of europe than slowly evolve their piwer until they control everything
One example I remember clearly him using is while imitating the germans talking about how they were slowly taking over the wolrd he said: "lets create a universal language that everyone from all countries will learn to communicate and call it German". Like dad
we did that
English
Did you forget that
What the hell
Yeah my dad is a crazy bigot
Used to value him so much, lost all respect for him
Dont consider him my dad at all anymore
I love all people though
I dont think its fair to hold people from a country against what their country did years and years ago, most likely before they were even born
I dont want anyone to hold how England basically invaded everywhere and stole everyones stuff etc, so Im not gonna hold stuff a country did over someone who had no say in the matter at all (unless they agree with the bad things the country did, then its fuck them)
I can't say anything definitively
But I have heard some anti-German rhetoric with people who identify more with the UK, mainly football hooligans, who go on about the war and have to insert it into anything Germany-related
I was with extended family once, someone mentioned they were going on holiday to Germany and someone had to say "we won the war".
Most people don't have a strong opinion either way I feel
Kinda but also not at all
Some older people are less than fond of Germany and Germans in general, but anyone younger than 70 seems to have a pretty neutral to good opinion of Germans, unless they’re just xenophobic and don’t like any foreigners
I’d go so far as to suggest that Germany is probably one of the most well liked countries among the Scottish public
Non-existent in Scotland
In fact, people in Scotland are probably Germanphiles
Very little
Some older people I know don't trust them
I thought they where fine when I visited
Lol it's the same situation in England and Ireland
A quarter of England's population has Irish ancestry, and cities like Liverpool have probably 50%+ Irish descendant populations, but the two countries are still considered "enemies" because that's just how humans work I guess
That's rather ironic
The Swiss are stereotyped as being the Germans on steroids sometimes, "even more humour-less, harder workers, more anal about order and laws, etc
Because it was West Germany that England beat in the World Cup final in 1966
Yessir
Hope things look up dude
God bless
Tim Horton's is headquatered in Canada but mostly owned from Brazil
Rockstar North
Rockstar North Limited (formerly DMA Design Limited) is a British video game development company and a studio of Rockstar Games based in Edinburgh
... In 1997, DMA released Grand Theft Auto, which was a huge success; the game sparked a successful series
I thought it was primarily developed by Rockstar North, which was founded in Dundee and is now based in Edinburgh
Swindon
I spat my pepsi out reading that lol
Just finished work and thought I'd try something foreign
Don't repeat that in Glasgow, you'll have half the city trying to burn them down and the other half trying to defend them
You must take this chance and then fight to keep it every generation but I truly believe it would change the USA in ways unimaginable
looking from across the pond
In what way would it ever be a *bad* idea
That's the real question
Unless you own a bunch of shares in a health insurance company or are a high flying surgeon or something
Is the NHS perfect
Of course not but I could *never* imagine switching to the US system
It's literally profits before people and that's utterly fucked
Universal healthcare is amazing
October 2018 I ended up in the a&e at 1am with suspected water intoxication after I drank 10 pints of lime and soda way too quickly
I was seen in a&e right away and was admitted into the hospital at 4am when a bed freed up in the amu with the staff dropping by to make sure I was ok
I had diluted my blood so much that my sodium levels were dangerously low
I was released at 1pm that day after sleeping and my sodium levels returned to normal
My stupidity only cost me taxi fair to and from the hospital
Part of it was also that in the democratic countries, old parties had again been somewhat discredited and voters wanted change
The Liberal party died in the UK pretty much due to WWI, and WWII made parts of the British population want something different from continued Toryism
A total war inherently shakes up the political space, because it is some impactful and invasive to daily life
Scottish tap water became a bit of a meme earlier this year, it's pretty good
It does vary a bit from area to area, I find that Edinburgh's water isn't as nice as my own town's. For some reason my MiL only drinks the bottled stuff though
The tap water here is so good (at least in rural areas) that it is basically the same stuff they sell in bottles as luxury-branded 'Scottish mineral water'. If you are in the cities it's not as good, but still perfectly safe and good to drink - and most people do
it varies a lot over the UK - south and east tend to be hard water areas with poor tasting tapwater - Scotland and the North West of England are soft water with mostly decent tapwater
that's fair, it can be strong in places
How does that compare with NL
Do you guys chlorinate less
I get this weird enjoyment out of finding etymological similarities in words from different languages, and seeing the word “frekwencja” got me all giddy because it made me realise it’s like “frequency” in English, which is used similarly in so many other languages too
I - a native English speaker - have the same problem in Arabic
I can use Arabic fairly fluently to discuss summit meetings, peace talks, constitutional reforms, weapons of mass destruction, terrorist attacks and landmines
That's the professional language I've had to use in my work
But I'm stuck on the names of common vegetables, or how to ask for more pillows in a hotel
Calling people English
Calling them British, while factually correct and OK to some, is also a bit risky
As a Scottish person yeah this is true, don't
Scene: A boulangerie-pâtisserie shop in a small town rural southern France
Dramatis Personae:
- English tourist, equipped with panama hat and 5 years of school boy French
- French shopkeeper, equipped with stereotypical large moustache
Tourist: [Enters shop, fails to say bonjour]
Shopkeeper: Bonjour, Monsieur
Tourist: Je voudrais deux baguettes, s’il vous plaît.
Shopkeeper: Bonjour Monsieur
Tourist: Je voudrais deux baguettes, s’il vous plaît.
Shopkeeper: Bonjour Monsieur

DEUX BAGUETTES
Shopkeeper: Bonjour Monsieur
Tourist: Bonjour Monsieur
Shopkeeper: See, it is not hard to be polite here in my shop
Two baguettes coming up
I’m gonna add a few:
Don’t call us Irish either
It is substantially better than calling us English, but it’s still annoying
Scottish culture has historically been mocked quite extensively in pop culture, so don’t do that
There’s a fair chance people will just take it as a joke and have a laugh, but it’s probably not worth the risk
Don’t try a Scottish accent
An awful lot of people, particularly Americans, seem to think they can pull it off
They can’t. It’s very annoying
Also, if you are planning on visiting the UK, particularly England, then I’m gonna offer you some advice and say don’t bring up the Empire
It probably won’t piss anyone off, but you’ve got like a 50/50 chance of running into one of those “Britannia rules the waves” people, and it’s honestly better to just save yourself the headache
This really gets me
I prefer being called Scottish, but I don't mind being called British (It's what I technically am)
Being called English though is just plain wrong and ignorant
It's the exact same as like calling a French person German
This has always confused me a bit
Like, I can understand why someone might get languages like Norwegian and Swedish confused with one another cause they sound similar, but you only have to listen to a five second clip of Portuguese to realise that Portuguese and Spanish are COMPLETELY different languages
I'm afraid that the most common term for Dutch people in some languages is "Hollander" (in Portuguese, "holandês"), so the confusion is pretty entrenched
This is the second time I’ve seen an Icelandic person on this thread talk about off road driving
Is it a common problem in Iceland
Lmao I’ve got a Ukrainian friend here in Scotland
Nothing, and I mean NOTHING pisses him off more than people calling him Russian
So naturally, we call him Russian at every opportunity
Guilty
To be fair, it does taste better (ducks for cover)
Well, that's just a lazy insult, I'm incredibly disappointed that this is the best he could come up with
That there
is fightin' talk :D
Cornwall is the only place I've heard someone stop themselves and deliberately refer to a black person as a "negro" because it *less* offensive than the word they'd partially said
If it makes you feel better about Cornwall, the current champion of their traditional annual street-brawl-turned-sport is the son of an Italian immigrant
>Dating back to before the 16th century, "Hurling the Silver Ball" is considered to be the county's official sport (alongside Cornish wrestling) and involves the Townsmen and Countrymen engaging in what's probably best described as a lawless game of street rugby
The objective is to place a specially made silver ball in one of the goals set two miles apart at opposing ends of the town
But as I'd garnered from a couple of pretty violent stories, it's never that simple
>Townsman Marco Ciarleglio, the 22-year-old son of a half-Italian fish and chip shop owner, was the reigning champion—the winner of the previous three events, in fact—and in no mood to relinquish his crown
As tradition dictates, he had "called up" hurling veteran and the 1977 titleholder Philip Tremain to do the honors
Being the champ is a big deal in these parts
I'm sorry to hear that mate, and genuinely surprised - but then again, I've never been to Cornwall so I wouldn't know how bad the racism is down there
> No one will get genuinely angry with you
That depends a lot on the Scot in question and how drunk they are at the time
But by and large, no, they wouldn't get pissed off unless you were being deliberately annoying
At this point I'm pretty sure nobody will see this but:
\-Tbh I'd react the same way if you called me Irish as if you called me Russian - it's simply not true
\-Yes
Especially yelling "Freedom
\-Yes
\-Yes, especially if you actually know the history of it all
"mate". It's just easier that way
(In general it's better to use the individual nation rather than British, but most people will let the wrong term slide or offer a polite correction - as it's obvious that's being done by mistake, rather than as a wind-up)
"People of the British isles" is the only way I can really think of since the BI include Ireland and you do NOT call them British
One thing I've come to appreciate over the years is beer with foam
I mean I love my ketchup as much as the next ketchup addicted person
But I would never, never, ever, ever put it on any pasta dish
That is pretty much a cardinal sin
It’s the generations of inbreeding
> "Ostküsten-Eliten" (east coast financial elites),
I don't think that's a dogwhistle for Jews
A lot of people in the US hate the old school Anglo-Saxon, Protestant politicians like George Bush Senior, and they're the epitome of "east coast elite".
Hating on the mainstream media isn't really a Nazi exclusive thing either
American Socialists and Communists have never trusted the New York Times, CNN, etc
If anything, a few years ago, distrusting the mainstream media was the Left's thing, since they always accused it of being a tool of the American government
Now listen here you little shit
I don't
Calling it a mess is the biggest understatement this century ahahaha
Ok since it's you I'll give it a go
Not all Welsh teams
And there is also 1 English team playing in Scotland
I read somewhere we are 2nd in the developed world for obesity so we've got to do much better to beat America

My German husband tends to roll his eyes when i (british/australian) counter his arguments for german superiority with "yer, but scoreboard"....
Do you really think the average English person knows nothing of the troubles
That's a bit of a strange assumption to make
We don't have a particularly strong opinion of him in either direction in Scotland
Not sure I'd say our head of state is particularly epic considering she's an inbred German living off the work of millions
Also drinking cultures
Scotland and Northern Ireland perform quite badly compared to England and Wales, largely due to this iirc
Probably influenced somewhat by the other factors you mentioned, but it definitely causes more strain on our systems, and I'd be surprised if this divide in the UK didn't play out betwren northern European countries and the south
We had a prank day which was our last day before exams, but teachers got really good at shutting it down after a kid was tied to a tree for around 3 hours
Our school had a massive staircase up to the dining hall, which had the later addition of a very sturdy bannister, as some enterprising 6th formers had manhandled a teacher's mini up there some years ago
We just superglued cds everywhere and catapulted water bombs into the school at random from the field outside
Did yous call it muck up day
I’m not sure if that was specific to my school or if it was across scotland
A first year got kidnapped by sixth years in a nearby school so their last day stuff got shut down, ours was shut down shortly after simply because the head teacher got fed up of the mess
6ths years 2 years ahead of me were pretty fucked up and hung a mannequin from a noose in a pretty hidden area, teacher spotted it and had a panic attack and called 999
Yeah muck up day was cancelled at least until I left
Wow, the south really *is* that uptight
Seriously like, chill oot lads and hae some fun
We did it in Scotland, the last day of lessons before exams
Our year had a massive waterfight through the school, one of the years above me had a whipped cream fight and the school stank for a week
We called it muck-up day
We called it muck up day as well, or just "last day"
Nah we called it prank day
I don't know anything about the landuage thing but I think the bows were supposed to have non metal heads so he couldn't use his ferrokinesis on them
Haven't heard much Gaelic in movies but I'd imagine it's not very good considering there's not many native speakers left
Scots in movies 99% always seems to be modern English in a bad Scottish accent with a couple of Scots words chucked in
Which would be fine if they were going for modern Scots, or used the Scots words properly
The dwarves from the Witcher 3 stand out in the right idea but nae clue category "I have them dinnae I not
(Scottish English or Scots)
My personal gripe is to do with SO MANY films and television shows casting Americans as Scottish people
The stereotypes, the bad accents, the use of Americanised slang and vocabulary in said bad Scottish accent are so jarring to the point of bbeing obnoxious and insulting
Like seriously, there are plenty of Scottish people about, even for voice acting roles
There are over 5 million of us - you could absolutely find one
Hell, I'm sure you could even find people willing to do it for free just to make the "OHH HIGHLUNDURRR GRR" nonsense stop
And it needs to stop
Immediately
Edward Richtofen is my favourite fake German
Aye thats Gàidhlig had a look there
It's not great but you can tell they've worked at it
Depends how busy, mountains like Ben Nevis have a constant stream of people you would be saying Hi every 20 secs
Yes
Often accompanied with a quip about the weather, or how the other person is looking fitter/faster/younger than you
it's not usually hi or hello here, it's more 'yalright'
On any country road really
I don't live in a particularly mountainous bit of Scotland
Yes
A very brief conversation about the weather or the route might also be acceptable
Nah they smell of sweat and spilled beer ever since the smoking ban

A dutch cap was a vaginal diaphragm too for a while
There's a story of my grandmother asking a clothes shopkeeper for "a dutch cap" with my mother and aunt and they were cringing and humiliated because said grandmother didn't know that it had that secondary meaning
And dutch cap, a ~~vaginal~~cervical  diaphragm
It now happens to be every single day
I'm an American by birth, emigrated to London in 2006
Lived until March in the Home Counties - just north of London
Post Covid we moved to Scotland
Wonderful place, wonderful people . . . BUT . . . I know technically they are speaking English
But for a certain set (usually 65 years or older) . . .god help me understand a single word
Living in england is this everyday
The amount of regional accents on one small island is a ridiculous amount
Im from the South West and trying to have a conversation from someone up North is very difficult sometimes, especially the likes of accents like the yorkshire accent, the scouse accent, its not up north but to some extent even the London accent is hard to understand
There are a lot of different London accents but theres one particularly (known as "the roadman accent") thats quite hard to understand, the language accent developed its accent with inspiration from african and jamaican roots, the langauge itself is filled with a lot of slang terms that arent widely used outside of the area where its spoken, so while theyre talking english a lot of the words they use will be completely new to you and like a whole new language
Overhearing a conversation in English at Changi airport between a Chinese Singaporean and a Malay Singaporean
It took me a while to realise that it really was English
It wasn't just the 'accent'; the intonation and rhythm of the England threw me off

Which one's the president this year
I do think though that a lot of these ideologies are quite difficult to place on a conventional left - right spectrum
It's kind of like saying "feudalism is right wing", it's a complete anachronism in modern politics, it's its own thing
Tbf you were ruled by Spain from 1580 to 1640, so 1640 would be a reasonable response to when you got independent from Spain
I mean they kind of are but not in the way Americans think there are, there are parts of this country police typically wont go into but they're more in places like Derry
Your username is not helping that misconception
If it's not St Emillion or Châteauneuf du Pape he's an imposter
To be fair some Texans might actually do that
I've heard of it happening relatively recently (like 1990s) in Scotland because the roads were too bad for cars and and bits of Texas are way more rugged than Scotland
Fake *gnus
Probably because the French surrender in world war two really fucked over the UK
It was kind of a big deal that we had to fend of the Nazis basically by ourselves for a year
In many ways it's the most significant thing the French did in living memory that impacted the UK

Anti vaxxers are attention seekers who risk the safety of everyone else so they can pretend to be smart
I support mandatory vaccination
I think the bodily autonomy of morons is still important and don't think vaccines should be mandatory at least until that's the last option
There's a level of unvaccinated people that society can cope with an maintain heard immunity
I think once that drops bellow a set level monetary incentives should be offered for vaccination, failing that harder but still soft methods should be used like requiring all children at school to be vaccinated or else not be able to attend school and finally start legally requiring people to have vaccines or face some type of consequence
Anti vaxxers are fuckin morons
Controversial I know
A tag team of someone with downs syndrome great at noticing stuff paired an autistic person who knows everything but wouldn't notice his head falling off unless pointed out to them would make a great feel good movie

The thing about Ibiza is, if you go outside of San Antonio or Playa Den Bossa, there really is a different type of tourist
Places like Santa Eularia, Es Canar and other towns are really nice places that attract families and older couples

Plenty of Brits treat Prague as a cheap stag/hen do location and don't really care about seeing anything other than the bars with beers for £1 or less (or those cycle bar things) when they go

Hot yesterday but mild today
Just a bit humid but not too bad
I get people think it's too hot but personally i'm grateful for any sun
It's been really warm recently for our standards but I've not really noticed it that bad since I'm not really going out much
When I get in the car though, it's sometimes so warm that you can actually feel the warmth entering your body when you breathe
Today's made up for it though with a fair bit of rain and thunder and lightning
People who live in overseas European territories - how much of a connection would you say you feel to the country you're (technically) part of and is that reflected in your territory's overall society and culture
Sorry for the long question, hope this counts as Europe
Not OP but from Scotland, currently there is nothing to distinguish Scots, Welsh or Northern Irish citizens from English ones on the passport
Feeling of nationality is split between older generations/religion and which country you are originally from in the UK
People in England tend to feel "more British" than Scots
Hey,
So firstly thanks for the detailed answer
Anyways, we have UK nationality with our passport looking exactly the same as that of an English person, nothing complicated there
As for how much of a connection we feel to the UK, it can vary; it looks like most Scots still want to remain in the UK but you don't see many that identify as "British" first (outside Rangers supporters - will explain if asked)
In fact, calling most of us "British" is a no-no, though we'll go easy on you if you're from abroad and just explain that rather than stabbing you
Usually,
As for a connection to England, well it's definitely stronger with the north than with London and anywhere further south
Since the accents are different, the culture more cosmopolitan and the population much more densely packed, I genuinely feel like I'm in a different country once I get there
So really, while we both love beer and football, the only connection most of us feel is a political one, that we're part of the same sovereign state (and usually England gets its way since it has far more people than we do)
I crossposted to the Curacao sub, as for the French Guiana one it only has 26 members so we might be scuppered there
Scots are born with a bottle of whisky in their hand, and a fag in the other
Not part of the question but I'll answer
Personally I am purely Scottish, I never call myself British because I rarely ever feel culturally connected to the complete opposite of me in say Kent
But in Scotland I am an Islander/Highlander/Teuchter
While I grew up a few years in Glasgow I've never considered myself a Lowlander, since the family I had most investment in was Hebridean, I lived in the Hebrides, and my other side of the family are South African/Ulster
My flatmate though, is a stonch British nationalist
He is British first, never calls himself ¿Ayrshire-ish
, but will call himself Scottish when outside of Europe like the USA
Is this because Switzerland itself isn't one country
Its multiple countries with multiple Presidents that band together for international reasons
Or am I just mistaken
The overlapping and interlacing identities are very interesting
I'd identify primarily as Scottish and European, but also as British
(Having a British aspect to my identity doesn't stop me from wanting Scottish independence
I am a great Anglophile in many ways, but that doesn't mean I want to be ruled from London
There's many different reasons people want the union or independence
I've known people proud to be Scottish that would prefer to be ruled by London
Exactly
It's sometimes portrayed that if you 'feel Scottish' you want independence and if you 'feel British' you want the Union, but - although that's the general pattern - there are many exceptions and nuances
What's it called
Cumbernauld
A new town built in the 60s out of concrete and straight lines, it's won awards for its ugliness on multiple occasions
In Scotland, any of the new towns that were built in the 60s and 70s! And many others in the central belt
Glasgow is beautiful in part and a complete dump in other parts
East Kilbride, Cumbernauld (a famous one), Greenock, Airdrie, Glenrothes, Kirkcaldy, Fort William (in a beautiful location but the town centre really sucks), the list could go on
The UK really does have the worst urban design in Europe I would argue
At least they gave us Irn Bru
Haha beat me to it
I would have gone for Dundee, but really it's impossible to argue against Cumbernauld
Originally brewed and in Falkirk however
Yes it’s really terrible
It has such lost potential
Big ugly dual carriageway and roundabouts completely cutting off the high street from the water
Madness
Although it would be expensive, I think they should tunnel the A82 (or at least reduce it to 2 lanes and slow speed to 30) and then build a new street or park along the waterfront
Would do the town enormous good
Part of it could be we are much more conformist: we don't have the same individualistic streak Americans do
Shame and public disapproval can be very effective
In the UK we had a thing where mums were dropping their kids off at school, or going to the supermarket in their jammies
Schools sent home letters saying it was unacceptable, supermarkets made statements and the papers ran it for a while
It's been years since I saw someone in Tesco in their PJs, used to be a weekly occurrence
In America I'd imagine that kind of disapproval would be net with "this is 'murica" and they'd keep doing it because individualism is a far bigger thing there
So your crazies don't get shamed into keeping their crazy locked up while in public
From the school POV it was about appropriateness
They're trying to teach kids about wearing uniform and looking smart coming to school; seeing parents standing at the school gates in PJs and slippers undermined that
The supermarkets went down the same route as restaurants; you must be dressed appropriately to enter
It didn't really hurt anyone but it's about the image these companies wanted to display
None of them wanted to get their own version of r/peopleofwalmart following
\*whatever you want depending on the day and whoever is "reading"\*
We don't really have a constitution but we have a couple of acts that define Scotland's government and relationship with England

The Darien Scheme in the 1690s. It was a last ditch attempt to build up a colony in what is now Panama, before Scotland was left in the dust in the colonisation game
We literally threw every bit of coin we had at it to make sure it would be successful
We got there, the climate and conditions killed off over half the crew
Then, the Spanish show up and start attacking due to it being their claimed land (go figure)
Then, England starts sabotaging it to make it fail by setting up blockades
It went on from about 1695-1700 before it was given up on
It would have maybe went a little better if there was any solid planning on our side
It was unrealistic to think it'd ever work
That lead to Scotland going bankrupt
In 1707, England offered to pay of Scotland's debt if all power was given to London
And that lead to the kingdom of Great Britain
It's a small event that sets up something a bit bigger I would say
The fact that a Rolls Royce factory in East Kilbride, Scotland, refused to make parts for the Pinochet regime in Chile and grounded the entire Chilean airforce at the time
All i remember about it is that it was one of a number of pre reformation reformation movements similar to the Lollards in England
Basically the moderates worked with the HRE emperor and the radicals were outcast
Just to note, there was very little of Scotland's money spent on Darien
Most of the money had come from private subscriptions, so it was the merchant class that was bankrupt
The Scottish state was running a surplus, and access to Scotland's national cash reserves were one of England's key motivations for promoting the Acts of Union
I think that time period became a lot better known outside Germany thanks to the popularity of the Baader-Meinhof Complex film; I remember it being pretty well received at the time

Edinburgh has pretty decent cycle network
All the old railways around town have been converted into nice wide paths for bikes and pedestrians
Most places in the city are accessible fairly easily by these, and they crisscross enough that the network is versatile too
As a result cycling on roads feels wrong to me
Like I'm breaking some kind of social norm
I’ve heard quite a few people from the North East of Scotland do this too except they inhale as they say ‘aye’.
Quite a few words in Scots are similar to Scandinavian languages: bairn/barn, hus/hoose, bra/braw, flytta/flit, gåta/greet, dykke/dook, etc
French does that same thing with ‘si’.
I believe it’s got a lot to with the vowels having not shifted in Scots
So hoose instead of house
When I lived in Belgium I found there were a lot of common words/sounds between Scots English and Flemish

Maybe an unpopular opinion but I think the current system is fine
People are talking about the benefits of winter/summer time in this thread, but you get the benefits of both year-round by switching twice a year, and having one hour less of sleep on one night is worth the countless hours of extra sunlight in the day imo
Ideally keeping winter time year round
We're too far north and west so the extra light in the mornings would be more beneficial for people walking to school
If I have to pick then I'd say keep winter
In winter here if you kept summer time we wouldn't have even twilight until 9am, the sun wouldn't be up until closer to 10am
And the sun would still set before 5pm so you're not getting any benefit from it at the other end of the day
In summer if you don't bring the clocks forward you've still got civil twilight until the back of 10 at night which is sufficient for most people
But the better option is definitely to keep daylight savings, neither summer/winter is ideal all year round
I think that permanent winter time would be better
It's much too dark in the mornings, especially for kids going to school
When I was younger I was shocked to learn that the south of France and Spain had "shorter" summer days than here, since we barely see the sun anyway
But if you're high enough latitude that you get significantly lighter evenings then in winter you won't gain any real benefit
In Athens (just picked because it's far south) the day length difference between longest/shortest days is only 5 hours, in Edinburgh its more than double that
If you kept summer time, the evenings are just as dark by the time people finish work, and everyone has to go to work before even civil twilight has started (never mind sunrise)
Having some light in the morning when you need to be more awake is more important than a brief glimmer of twilight at the end of the day imo
Sorry to hear that, hope you’re able to adjust soon
My sleep schedule is a mess already which is maybe why I didn’t notice this as a problem lol
In mid summer where I live it doesn’t actually get completely dark at all so we’d still have long summer evenings
Our national animal is a unicorn, that's super wholesome

Glasgow
It was the template for New York, so you can get away with all the road issues people have been talking about
Imo I'd say Glasgow obviously due to some bias but it would make some sense since Rockstar is Scottish
Even if it's not set there and maybe like London or something (Which would be my 2nd idea) it'd be cool if they made a visit to Glasgow to the schemes and all that sort of like North Yankton in GTA V
1990's Edinburgh would be an interesting choice
Rockstar has a base in the city (Rockstar North) so not impossible, and back then the city was far more criminal than it is now
Also, the contrast of the historic Old Town, rich New Town, and places like Leith (think Trainspotting) would make for very varied gameplay
The castle looming over the center would make for a great central hub/landmark
One more great thing about Edinburgh is the relitively small size compared to places like London or Paris, allowing the player to learn the geography of the place, giving it a feeling of home that may be lost in larger cities
Dundee Scotland, simply because it was created in Dundee and I think being a knife wielding drug addict would be fun
Loch Ness - There's other, prettier, quieter lochs all over the Highlands
Edinburgh Castle is also very expensive for what it is
Probably Edinburgh
Even the Scottish people there are probably English
London
You've not been to the UK if you've only been to London IMO
It doesn't represent the people here at all or what things are like nationwide
The royal mile, everything's priced through the bloody roof and very little is good enough to pay for it
Or any of those shops with tartan store fronts playing pipe music from it
They lure you in with £12 stuffed heilan coos, football scarves and the promise of selling people key rings with "their" clans Crest or arms or tartan on it
I get that as a nation we have a very strong "brand image" that people like to see and engage with and buy tourist tatt for, I get that I worked in tourism, but those shops are all the same and they're all over priced
Might get some good shortbread or tablet though
> Edinburgh Castle was really beautiful and worth the visit
Aye, I was hesitant to put Edinburgh Castle, as a lot of people do enjoy it, but I'd advise any tourist to read up on first and check that it's something they'll be into before they go, as it's still pretty steep
If you like lochs - and who doesn't? - I can recommend Loch Lomond, although it's also very busy because it's so close to Glasgow, it is easier to get to
Loch Morar also has a monster legend associated with it

I'm looking at you
I drink Whisky and eat Haggis once a week
I drink Irn bru almost every day
I love hill walking in the highlands
I’ll take any excuse to wear a kilt
Although I hated ceilidh dancing in School, I now jump at an opportunity to put those 13 years of learning to ceilidh dance to use
I even have the most Scottish name possible without having a Mac or Mc
The only stereotypes I don’t have are that I’m not ginger (although I have a ginger beard), and I don’t have a strong accent, I’m from Edinburgh and have an American mother, so to most Scottish people I sound English or American
And I don’t care about football, rugby or golf
I own a kilt, and reckon I look pretty dashing in it whilst dancing at a ceilidh
I also drink whisky, and enjoy eating haggis
I don't eat haggis, don't particularly like whisky (but do like gin) and don't own any tartan clothing
My surname is not very Scottish but my ancestry is, as far back as I've been able to trace it
I don't belong to a clan and I'm not a red-head
I used to play the bagpipes, I own a kilt, I'm shit hot at a ceilidh, my diet is questionable, I've got a Scottish surname (albeit without Mac/Mc), occasional haggis eater, accent
I rarely drink whisky, I don't drink an excessive amount of Irn Bru, I'm not ginger (but some of my beard is)
- I do like Irn Bru although I don't drink it often because I don't drink a lot of fizzy juice
However, I don't think there's a difference between the old recipe and the new reduced sugar recipe and think people who have been crying about it are definitely exaggerating
- I don't eat haggis all that often
A couple of times a year maybe
Definitely on Rabbie Burns' day though
- I think the last time I wore a kilt was when I was 13 at my aunts wedding
- I do like whisky, but I much prefer rum as my spirit of choice
There are similarities in how they both taste, however the rules around making rum are less strict which allows for much more experimentation and creativity with flavours
- Depending on who I'm talking to, I have a strong Glaswegian accent
- I like Tennents lager
Well I had haggis for dinner yesterday and lunch and dinner today so

Sometimes in Scotland we look with envy at the power of the Irish-American lobby

Most inaccurate would have to be Braveheart
William Wallace wasn't a Highlander in a kilt, he was a medieval noble in chainmail riding about on a horse, like a knight
It seems to conflate several separate time periods, the Picts fighting the Romans (the blue paint on the face, which is conjectural in any case), the Middle Ages (when Wallace and Bruce actually lived) and the Jacobite rebellion (the 18th century)
In addition, the Battle of Stirling Bridge was fought (as the name suggests) on a bridge, not in an open field
The clichéd depictions of Scotland are actually very similar to the ones of Ireland, there's the Scot-Ireland confusion as you mention
An example of a film with plenty of Highland clichés, as well as depicting the Highlands as basically stuck in the 19th century (or before) is the 1996 film Loch Ness, where Ted Danson goes and stays in a hotel beside Loch Ness and uniquely discovers the monster
Of course the American is the voice of reason and uses his no-nonsense can-do attitude to solve the puzzle while the natives are all yokels and prefer to remain stuck in the past
To be honest looks exactly like the east end of Glasgow
In which the Scotsman was played by a barely-anglophone Frenchman, and the Egyptian with a Spanish name was played with a broad Edinburgh accent
Really
That's odd, as I reckon most people wouldn't recognise our national anthem, whereas there's a couple of pipe tunes (well, one), that I reckon folk would recognise instead

Blaming the UK for destroying some hyper-advanced utopia in the 1800s seems to be a recurring theme
In South America, some people like to blame the UK for starting the Paraguayan War too, because they claim that Paraguay had successfully industrialised on its own or something of the sort
Of course, the bit where Paraguay's army invaded Brazil, after Brazil intervened in Uruguay's internal conflicts, is seemingly ignored

We would get Berwick-upon-Tweed again, so having him lose an election up here is a price I'm willing to pay
Technically there would be a thin strip of England remaining, since Hadrian's wall is south of the current border

Also, only California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and the District of Columbia require a universal background check at the point of sale for all sales and transfers, whether purchased from a licenced dealer on unlicenced seller

> we’re the only British colony (besides Rhodesia) to separate in a bloody and unilateral way
Why do you need to have this sort of daft American exceptionalism
Nobody else would hit out with this sort of "We're the only ones who done this except from these other people who done it".
>So the constitution makes the access to firearms as a universal right
It doesn't *actually* though, because as we know there are plenty of things that can stop someone getting a gun legally
It's just not applied universally
If it's not a universal background check, it allows people to exploit loopholes
Only the states I listed have fully comprehensive universal background checks, from what I can find
> I didn’t say anything about American exceptionalism what are you on about
The section of your comment I quoted is an example of American Exceptionalism
"we’re the only British colony (besides Rhodesia) to separate in a bloody and unilateral way
Why bother saying this
You're basically just saying "We're not the only British colony to separate in a bloody and unilateral way", but you need to make it about the US for reasons of daft American Exceptionalism
>The second amendment says “the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed
” Which is a direct statement guaranteeing the right to own a firearm
Yet there are many restrictions that exist, so we know it's not a universal right
>Background checks do not violate the constitution
Background checks prevent people (rightly) from getting guns
So either you don't know what infringe means, or you don't know what universal means
Which is it
You can't say something is a universal right whilst simultaneously having restrictions on it
> I wasn’t aware that stating relevant historical examples was American exceptionalism
Let me explain it to you again
You claimed:
"we’re the only British colony (besides Rhodesia) to separate in a bloody and unilateral way
That means the US is not the only British colony to separate in a blood and unilateral way, **because Rhodesia also done it**.
So why would you preface your comment with "We're the only" if you're *not* the only ones to have done it
It's like someone saying "I'm the only person to run the 100m in under 10 seconds, except that other guy who done it as well
The American Exceptionalism comes from the false claim you're the only ones to have done it
What's wrong with saying "The US and Rhodesia are the only two British colonies to to separate in a bloody and unilateral way
>Also I speak English I know what infringe and universal means
Imagine you rent a flat, and in the contract it says you have universal access to a swimming pool in the back, and then the landlord says "But you can't use it on weekends".
Do you still have universal access
Or have they infringed your "universal access" stated in the contract

Dundee
It used to be a post industrial shitehole, and fared poorly in comparison* to oil boom Aberdeen
Dundonians are generally well politically engaged though+, and have had the sense to elect a few decades worth of good local politicians that have made a real effort to improve the city, and it's now something of a cultural hub
In addition, it's close to some very pretty scenery in Fife and the Angus glens, so would make a good base for exploring further afield, and the two universities in a small city make for a lively nightlife during term time
*Dundee and Aberdeen are both east coast cities, but quite far apart
The media often seems to align the two cities as near neighbours and rivals, simply because both are beyond the Central Belt, and the media isn't entirely sure where each one is
+ Dundee once rejected Winston Churchill as their MP, preferring to vote for a temperance (anti-alcohol campaigner) MP instead
Yep, they were so anti-Churchill, they voted for prohibition instead
I actually enjoy going to Aberdeen, just not for too long

The V&A is impressive, and the Discovery Museum has also been well regarded for a while
The tech hub side of it is interesting, as a lot of that stems from the output of Abertay University
Dundee has been much better at linking it's universities with industries in the city than other places
I think the hospital's out by the ring road/A90 to the south, so I'd imagine it's pretty quiet around there
The city centre's pretty small, and you'd definitely need a car to get to the interesting places round and about
That all depends where you did go to uni though

Apologies, that one passed me by completely
So to Serbians Scotland is the land of bastards ?

We also find that the bigger country controls the narrative not just on their own news, but on our news too
So we find ourselves having our own country explained back to us, mostly incorrectly
Especially when the news from England is about a devolved matter, and is therefore specifically irrelevant to NI
It's also worth keeping an eye out for how often news about NI is shown from an English perspective
Throughout the Troubles, the phrase, "Last night another soldier
" became famous as it was how an incident in NI was announced on the news
Military casualties were seen as more important, because the victim could come from somewhere else in the UK, whereas civilians were just locals
Maybe this is what you meant, but if you add "portugal" *with the quotes*, all results will contain that exact word
Otherwise google will try and be clever and include 'portuguese' etc

In Scotland and for the Scottish Parliament things are slightly different compared to Westminster
Instead of the FPTP mess, we have proportional representation and numbered choices on the ballot
I like it because you can both choose exactly what you believe in (as much as any single party can be that), then continue choosing the lesser evils in the alternative options until you decide "that's too evil for me, and I'd rather not even dignify this party with a mark of my pencil" and not choose them at all
I normally end up making choices up to 3 and leave the other 3 blank
Thankfully also for Westminster elections, my party have become quite strongly represented, so I can vote for them with my single vote confidently without guiltily crossing another party's box instead
I voted for the first time last year right after turning 18, and I voted for the party I genuinely believed in
I like that party less now due to leadership changes and they didn't win the election or my constituency, but I'm happy with my vote last year
We have a Scottish Parliament election next year which functions a bit differently and I'll have to do a lot of research before that to decide who to vote for

> Brits do not like to be told by Americans we'd be speaking German if it wasn't for them
Do they not realise how bad we are at languages
that doesn't make it any less annoying/patronising though
That's largely a Spongebob joke, I believe
Columbus day was created by the Italian diaspora in the USA, who wanted to assimilate and show that they had their own national heroes who contributed to the making of the nation
Nowadays, Columbus Day is under a lot of criticism because colonisation of the Americas was a bit of a shit deal for the Indigenous population, and he is increasingly seen in a bad light (not just in the USA mind you, the statue of Columbus in Buenos Aires's presidential house was also subject to criticism and removed)

&#x200B;
> If thou speak'st false,
>Upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive,
>Till famine cling thee: if thy speech be sooth,
>I care not if thou dost for me as much
>I pull in resolution, and begin
>To doubt the equivocation of the fiend
>That lies like truth: 'Fear not, till Birnam wood
>Do come to Dunsinane:' and now a wood
>Comes toward Dunsinane
Arm, arm, and out
>If this which he avouches does appear,
>There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here
>I gin to be aweary of the sun,
>And wish the estate o' the world were now undone
>Ring the alarum-bell
Blow, wind
come, wrack
&#x200B;
Middle English:
>Knight ther was, and that a worthy man,
>That fro the tyme that he first bigan
>To ryden out, he loved chivalrye,
>Trouthe and honour, fredom and curteisye
>Ful worthy was he in his lordes werre,
>And therto hadde he riden (no man ferre)
>As wel in Cristendom as hethenesse,
>And ever honoured for his worthinesse
&#x200B;
Old English:
>Wæs se grimma gæst Grendel haten,
mære mearcstapa, se þe moras heold,
fen ond fæsten; fifelcynnes eard
wonsæli wer weardode hwile,
siþðan him scyppend forscrifen hæfde
in Caines cynne
þone cwealm gewræc
ece drihten, þæs þe he Abel slog;
ne gefeah he þære fæhðe, ac he hine feor forwræc,
metod for þy mane, mancynne fram
Don't worry most English speakers can only get a few words of this
The oldest Old English we have an example of:
>Nū scylun hergan hefaenrīcaes Uard, metudæs maecti end his mōdgidanc, uerc Uuldurfadur, suē hē uundra gihwaes, ēci dryctin ōr āstelidæhē ǣrist scōp aelda barnumheben til hrōfe, hāleg scepen
Thā middungeard moncynnæs Uard, eci Dryctin, æfter tīadæfirum foldu, Frēa allmectig
For this particularly I wonder if those Germanic language speakers among you, particularly anyone who speaks Dutch might be able to understand this as no native English speakers can understand this
[Here's the audio of this text for anyone interested
&#x200B;
And for fun we'll throw in the sister language for English, Scots:
> This is the storie o the birth o Jesus Christ
His mither Mary wis trystit til Joseph, but afore they war mairriet she wis fund tae be wi bairn bi the Halie Spírit
Her husband Joseph, honest man, hed nae mind tae affront her afore the warld an wis for brakkin aff their tryst hidlinweys; an sae he wis een ettlin tae dae, whan an angel o the Lord kythed til him in a draim an said til him, "Joseph, son o Dauvit, be nane feared tae tak Mary your trystit wife intil your hame; the bairn she is cairrein is o the Halie Spírit
She will beir a son, an the name ye ar tae gíe him is Jesus, for he will sauf his fowk frae their sins
Excuuuuuuse me but Scots is still spoken to this day
[This is a fun video to watch]
Yeah this is good, my choices for the extracts used were not that great
There's much more ordinary early middle English than a Shakespeare play, the middle English is probably actually too easy and extract and Beowolf was me being a bit lazy
Yeah that all this is literary language and as such might not be too representative of how people actually spoke is probably a good point
I imagine all of us might have an easier time understand a more normal conversation
Here's a more normal conversation someone reconstructed [ I can get quite a lot of the words from that
Yeah I understand the Ukrainian thing, for a person like me who understands Scots pretty well but wouldn't call myself a full speaker the trippiest thing is listening to a person with a very well spoken upper class accent speaking in a dialect that I struggle with like Doric or Orcadian because it sounds almost like a posh person speaking standard English one sentence and then goes completely off into something that sounds more like badly pronounced Swedish the next sentance
Would you say that in your opinion from Scots seems as different to English as standardised German is to Dutch
I'm kind of interested in just how different it is considering the fight over if it counts as a language or not
Yeah sorry I probably should have included them:
&#x200B;
The early modern English (Macbeth) is 1606
The middle English (The Canterbury Tales) is 1387 to 1400
The first old English (beowulf) is 975 to 1025 but the poem may have potentially have been first written a couple hundred years earlier
The second old English (Cædmon's Hymn) is 658 to 680
The Scots (The Bible) is I believe 1983 but it uses functionally modern Scots
The use of ‘wood’ for an army is a plot point in Macbeth, which is where the text is from
Macbeth is told by the three witches that he will only be defeated when Birnam Wood comes to his castle, Dunsinane
Macbeth thinks that this means he is invincible - how can a wood come to his castle
His castle is then attacked by his enemy Malcolm, who has his men camouflage themselves with branches from the Birnam Wood - so the Wood comes to the castle and Macbeth is defeated
>Early modern: with some difficulty
The most baffling bit is how the writer uses the word "wood" for
an army
Haha sorry, yeah this is part of the play rather than a language issue, the story is basically that an early Scottish king gets a prophecy from some witches saying he will be king and he wont die until Birnam wood comes to the town of Dunsinane, to make the prophecy true he kills the king but his sons run away to England, when they come back they cut down and use the trees of Burnam wood to disguise their army (or possibly the numbers of their army) so the prophecy is fulfilled and the usurper is killed
Bairn means baby or child, not beforehand in Scots
I think most of us can pick out a lot of words especially people who understand Scots or highly divergent dialects of English like the old Northern dialects but are far from understanding
Yeah that would be interesting, there's a video out there somewhere of an old English hobbyest who goes to Frisland and is able to speak to people in old English and have them more or less understand him
This is pretty great, do you feel that your ability to speak Dutch gives you any advantage understanding this
And are you able to make much sense of the old English given the linguistic similarities between Dutch and Old English
I think I may have chosen too easy a middle English one as typically native Brits find the Canterbury Tales where I took it from pretty difficult but everyone can understand it here
&#x200B;
Here's a possibly more difficult excerpt from the same compilation
>With torment and with shamful deth echon
>This provost dooth thise Iewes for to sterve
>That of this mordre wiste, and that anon;
>He nolde no swich cursednesse observe
>Yvel shal have, that yvel wol deserve
>Therfor with wilde hors he dide hem drawe,
>And after that he heng hem by the lawe
Yeah I didn't choose a great extract for middle English here's a slightly harder one
&#x200B;
>With torment and with shamful deth echon
>This provost dooth thise Iewes for to sterve
>That of this mordre wiste, and that anon;
>He nolde no swich cursednesse observe
>Yvel shal have, that yvel wol deserve
>Therfor with wilde hors he dide hem drawe,
>And after that he heng hem by the lawe
And here's some Scots out loud first in popular folk song   [
and second someone just speaking
Naebody said it wasn't. Hence using a 1980s text
Pretty good, the real translation is:
&#x200B;
Now we shall honour the guardian of heaven, the might of the architect, and his purpose,the work of the father of glory as he, the eternal lord, established the beginning of wonders; he first created for the children of men heaven as a roof, the holy creator Then the guardian of mankind, the eternal lord, afterwards appointed the middle earth, the lands for men, the lord god almighty
I think the issue with the Scots is it has a lot more non English influence particularly from the Scandinavian languages but also a bit from medieval French, Latin and the Celtic languages giving it words that look a bit weird
Yeah, the problem with that is that it's part of a Shakespear play so you get less context for everything in that than for the others
That's interesting, I would have suspected it to be more difficult given how English is kind of famously a sponge for influence and changes fairly quickly
Though that might have been my bad choice of extract
Am a Gaelic speaker (learned/learning not native) nope nothing
Remember English doesn't come from the celtic languages
Approximately 30% of Scots say they can speak scots with something like 150,00 speaking Scots most of the time
Could you see if you can understand this in scots
I think most people are put off by the weird orthography, looking at it it seems really off but I suspect most people here can pick out a few words
Yeah although some people here are saying its much more similar to English than Dutch is to German
I wonder if I picked either a too familiar or too anglified scots extract but it's kind of difficult for me to know as I'm far from unfamiliar with the Scots language
Perhaps some very derived Ulster scots or some strong doric might be more similar to Dutch to German but I'd need a German's opinion to know
Shite that's Izzard
I never made the connection but it seems obvious now
I'm not an expert (as is made clear by this thread) but I think he pulled significantly from a lot of different forms of English present at the time and also some older English which is why he's so influential in creating modern English
It's not nessicary that that makes it difficult though it's how complicated the words are
Yeah I mean I can understand that though and my German is at a preschool level
Yeah figured as much, I've heard it said that it's about as similar as different Scandinavian languages are to each other but I'm not really sure
Ah ok
Here you go  [
Note to self: When choosing middle English extracts don't go for the one with Jew murder
&#x200B;
Yeah pretty much
&#x200B;
>With torture and with shameful death, each one, The provost did these cursed Hebrews serve Who of the murder knew, and that anon; From justice to the villains he'd not swerve
"Evil shall have what evil does deserve
" And therefore, with wild horses, did he draw, And after hang, their bodies, all by law
Maybe, I wonder if it says more about Greek though, I wonder if it went under a lot of influence while under occupation
That's pretty good, I doubt most Scots could get all of that
Hmm that's interesting as I've heard the opposite before from a Swede
If you wouldn't mind could you listen to this 40 second video of spoken Doric Scots and see what you think
Ahhh that makes more sense now
Here's a clip of more typical spoken Doric if you want to give it a shot  [
Old English isn't that similar to Icelandic or old Norse though
It comes from the languages of the old continental North Sea coast with the closest modern relative language (excluding Scots) being Frisian
Yeah your video is scots but it's quite anglified and not really broad scots
Its in the same dialect as the prayer but it's more if an example of the accent than the full dialect
The one I sent you is quite derived scots in a tricky dialect though
I'm really not convinced of this, do you have a source for this
It shouldn't really be much more intelligible than modern Danish and German are to each other given the history
&#x200B;
Certainly in later times though old English went under a significant influence from Old Norse
Hmmm that's interesting, I'll read through that thesis but I'm not sure how that could be the case given old west Germanic is very much different to old north Germanic and Old English is very clearly an old west Germanic derived language more in the grouping with modern German and Dutch
My town has a touch March from the centre of town up the small mountain at the back of the town on new year
It started from when the area was controlled by the vikings as a celebration of a good year (or something along those lines)
Then we also burn a wooden model ship
It not really a Scottish thing but it’s popular in areas that have large Nordic connections like the Shetlands, outer Hebrides and parts of Argyll
Wait, *Freya*? Is this because of the Suebi and Gothic settlers in Iberia
Isn't the North American Halloween an amalgamation of different traditions from Ireland and Britain
I mean, I probably got a biased account of it, but I was taught that the tradition of dressing in costumes was a Scottish thing originally
Celebrate the *failure* of the terrorist attack
Celebrations consist of burning Guy Fawkes in a pyre
It's literally a reenacted mass lynching
And Orkney
There's a reason why Protestants considered Catholics to be heretical lmao
See also: all those armoured skeletons and corpses of holy figures that are preserved and displayed in Catholic churches throughout Europe
Fucking hell, she must have been a real bitch for everyone to get so mad at her
The Germanic Suebi and Goths settled in Iberia after the Western Roman Empire fell
There are a few words and names in Iberian languages that are actually Germanic in origin (iirc "Guerra" is Germanic in origin)
Well we have Boris Johnson who is about as incoherent as you can get
Quite respectable tbh, surprised he chose to do it in English instead of French though
It's amazing what you can get away with when you're wealthy and have an RP accent
If you want more dictators speaking English, Mussolini actually made a short video addressed to the Italian-American diaspora
It's strange
The same clowns that praise his attempts at ancient Greek look down their nose at Welsh and Gaelic speakers for "speaking a dead language".
Using long words is not the same as eloquence
He struggles to string a coherent sentence together
I've never seen someone look down on people actually speaking gaelic
What i have seen is people asking why we need to have gaelic road signs everywhere and *ambuleans* / *poileas* vehicles
I don't know about *only* private high schools, but it's certainly more common there, and is seen as a symbol of social class
No, the difference is that neither Welsh nor Gaelic are dead languages
I think you just summed up Irish politics with that
> I asked also because i imagine that scots would be more interested in learning UK’s old languages than latin or greek
Gaelic specifically, rather than all of the UK's languages
It's also worth noting that Gaelic is a *living* language
Whilst it's got ancient roots, it's still the general language of everyday life in a few parts of Scotland, so it's not comparable to Latin or Ancient Greek in that sense
It's dismissed as a 'dead language' by bigots who genuinely seem threatened by the UK not being a monoculture
Look at the other comment in this thread in scared, emotive language about children in Wales being *forced* to learn Welsh, rather than the neutral phrasing of Welsh forming part of the curriculum in Wales
In Scotland, they removed most of the sugar from Irn Bru
Diabolical
Don’t t forget the English all but destroying Scottish and Irish culture
Banning kilts at one point just to piss us off
Banning children from speaking Gaelic in school, punishing them when they did
Killing the men and raping many Scottish women, trying make Scots look less Scottish over time
They still did contribute a lot to it .
Doesn’t excuse it though, like saying, an older child is fighting with a younger child, so an adult kills the younger child
You seem pretty salty about something I don’t actually care that much about
Clearly, you think that everybody who says anything negative about anything is trying to act a victim
The rich lowland Scots profited greatly, everyone else in Scotland did not
Same in England, because Scotland has less people and they were more spread out, that would skew the numbers
The rich (in the empire) profited, the poor did not, sane everywhere
The lowland Scots didn’t speak Gaelic, they spoke Scots, which was also seen as being a commoners language by the rich and the English
Scots was also, and is still (talking from experience) punished in school for speaking
I never mentioned the highland clearances once
It wouldn’t have happened (at least to the same extent) if the English hadn’t supported it
I’m not completely blaming England (at least I didn’t mean to),
What I meant was an older child is beating up a younger child, then the adult delivers the final blow
The adult is still involved, but the older child did most of it, although the adult still did help
How do you know what I care about
Read through most of the comments, I don’t give a shit, it’s something I said of the top of my head from my memory that you’ve taken a little too seriously
Also, “pretty much dead outside the highlands” the highlands is about half of the country (in land area before you start talking about population)
English and Scottish were very dark distinct back (lowland and midland), the borders were different, but the cultures were different
That’s why Scots tend to prefer the Irish to the English
False claims of what
What have I said that has been outright false here
(Not just slightly inaccurate or missing parts)
The last part of it, was mainly the English
The part about Gaelic culture was committed by both
I said and didn’t miss out part of it, which is what you are now talking about
As Scotland
Maybe when our Parliament sold the country to England so that the nobility could be bailed out after the Darien Scheme
As someone else mentioned the Highland Clearances were also a pretty dark spell in Scottish history
As Britain, exporting food during famines in colonies is a real low point
Forcing China to import our opium is also a pretty shameful point in our past
...and Austrians
You really pissed of some Englishmen
Those lassies burned one of their songs into my head in the 90s and it's still fucking there
*Say you will, say you won't*
*Say you'll do what I don't*
*Say you're true, say to me, "C'est la vie"*
Growing up in the UK this feeling always had its own specific televisual accompaniment: Time Team (a programme about archaeology), Songs of Praise (Christianity-lite), and Antiques Roadshow (a programme about old vases and crap that people found in their attics)
Every Sunday it was the same
In Scotland there are a few places where certain pagan rituals are still practiced, though normally in a diluted fashion
In my family people go down into the garden or grass before first light on the first day of spring to wash their face in the morning dew for health and beauty and to "wash off the winter" or something like that idk
I can never be bothered getting up that early, though I've done it a few times
It's quite bracing
Not ancient but on Robert Burns' Birthday we have a dance, a meal of hagis neeps and taties and drink
Also say old Burns poems
A Scot who doesn't rate IRN BRU
Heathens the lot of them
A Scottish person who doesn't like anything another Scottish person likes
It is called the No True Scotsman Fallacy after all
A non-binge drinking Scot
Scottish born n raised, I don't like haggis
same with us scots
Same, I might have well have been from Mars when my friends were chatting about the Prem in secondary school
Yes we have had a few but normally that's just because it's a period where we weren't getting shit on by the English or some other nation
Kaunas during the interbellum really did sound pretty awesome
Agree that an unfortunately large number of people oddly seem to think the Empire was the golden age
Especially odd that a number of working class people think that now, they would have been/still are fucked by a government that has imperialist interests
Personally think the "Golden Age" would be the breakup of the Empire but the breakup of the UK will be the future golden age
I take it that Vladislaus II is not up there
Not really, sooner the countries being held under the command of England/"United" Kingdom are freed of it, the better
The Union may have once been beneficial for more than just England (and by this I mostly mean those not a member of the working class) but not any longer
I know tis why I was mentioning it
Both bad kings of Hungary especially king very well
Whatever we vote in Scotland (MPs, Brexit, things voted on in Parliament) we are vastly outnumbered and can be easily voted down, this goes with the cultures of Scotland and England are becoming further apart particularly in a political sense with England wanting to go more right wing (even the North which is astounding to me after what The Witch did to it in the 70's) while Scotland is embracing a more centre of left position
More powers to the Scottish Government are sorely needed and repeatedly rejected by Westminster
Nuclear weapons are a ridiculous prospect and one the British government is continually entertaining while most of the Scottish government and the people of Scotland also, being aware of what a waste of money and resources it is along with the environmental impact
To the other person who has mentioned the previous referendum, that was before the people of Scotland voted in great majority to stay within the EU and being promised much greater powers in government
While the latter was partially fulfilled, the former was outright broken
Edit: I'm happy to hear the benefits of the union but frankly I don't imagine they will outweigh the cons
>when your car has issues with some of the parts, you don’t scrap the whole car
While that's true for maybe an aspect of suspension, the exhaust or maybe even something as big as the radiator, if the engine is broken then maybe it's time to look at a new car
The engine is busted, Westminster has repeatedly shrugged off the responsibility and ignored the issues because it has the power so it doesn't need to look at these issues seriously
This is why we (and personally I believe the other nations do too) need independence so that we in Scotland have say over our own present and futures, not people who have never lived here, been here and do not see the lives of people out with their ivory towers
The link you've provided is *okay*, I remember reading most of those arguments when I voted to remain within the UK
The sad part is that large aspects of it are untrue; we haven't seen high public spending like promised with austerity still being the policy being followed by the Tories, interest rates have plummeted anyway (before COVID and exacerbated more so by it), economic arguments about saving money by staying in the UK are void by the excessive amount spent on Brexit before we've even ended the transition period which ties into us having a big voice by staying in the EU
As for currency I'd happily adopt the dollar or the euro
Politics doesn't have to be an issue shared across the UK with four nations with vastly different political stances and situations
Perhaps Wales may struggle, I'm not Welsh and haven't really looked into what Wales' industries are nevermind a Welsh independence, Scotland on the other hand has enough industry to keep itself afloat and that would even be on a greener standpoint of leaving much of the oil in the ground
&#x200B;
At this point I'm going to assume you're English (not an attack point, just an assumption) and I make this assumption because of your points in two statements:
\> small gains from leaving the UK would be outweighed by the losses
\> issues surrounding Scottish Independence aren’t talked about as much except for an occasional speech
The pain of being dragged around by an archaic system against most of a country's will along with (what I imagine won't really be your fault, more the company you perhaps keep and where you stay) not seeing or hearing these issues talked about "except for an occasional speech".
The political differences I would highlight are England's increasing euroscepticism and desire for American Republican stances alongside growing economic innequality which is being roundly enforced by 10 years of Tory rule
Apologies if my argument was confusing, looking back I can see how, I'm advocating for Scottish Independence primarily and while I think Irish independence/reunification is a good move that's another ball game
Scottish Independence and if the rest of the UK goes I don't think it would be too sad a day but I don't know the complexities of the other countries' situations, economics, etc
You're correct on attention in news but until there's enough momentum at a particular point, significant marches in cities and so on it's not newsworthy especially to outlets like the BBC, Daily Fail, The S-n, Daily Shitpress and The Torygraph (all government and gov doner mouthpieces)
While people in England may not be overly keen on A.Rep-ism, a large amount of people in England are overly fond of the Tories who are playing games increasingly like the Republicans
I understand it isn't all but it is an upsettingly large amount
The fact that "we're probably stuck with them" until one other party emerges is broken, so horribly broken and yet another reason why Scotland should break from the UK
Kier Starmer is forming a good backbone to Labour in England lately but to wait for England to stop feeling hurt by the *big bad labour party* (*wobbles lip*) because of FPTP being a broken, archaic system is ridiculous
Edit: formatting
I believe the independence of Scotland will be a golden age, whether that's true for the UK as well as Scotland will remain to be seen however dismantling imperialism further will certainly be a good step for all the countries involved
&#x200B;
At the time I was younger and lived in an area that was LD, now Tory with a very heavy Better Together aspect, the few Independence supporters seemed like zealots and screamed and screamed about it, that along with the cuddly cute approach of BT (while also scaremongering enough to make you believe leaving the UK would be a disaster) made me believe that leaving the UK would result in economic doom with Scotland not being able to stand on one leg
&#x200B;
Propoganda works
In a Paris Metro station I seen a homeless guy having a wank while watching people walk by
It was absolutely surreal
Winston Churchill was chased out of our city when he was our MP
He then became Prime Minister (twice) and purposely cut funding for projects here
Prick
Some sheep are just wee bastards
Always are
The north east is often bypassed by tourists
It's not as spectacular as the west coast, but there's some very pretty mountain areas in Upper Deeside, and a spectacular coastline south of Aberdeen, including the dramatic Dunnotter Castle
The north east also has lots of the whisky distilleries
At the other end of the country, large areas of Dumfries and Galloway are scenic wilderness, much less visited and more remote than parts of the Highlands, albeit with lower hills
As a Brit, I feel Durham deserves more love, really really stunning city
You can have a good time just looking around the colleges which are all beautiful
Pints are also pretty cheap too :)
For Spain I would say somewhere like Ciuadad Rodrigo or Salamanca, incredibly beautiful but not that many foreign tourists
Inverness is nothing special, but it's within easy travelling distance of some very impressive places, so it makes a good base
Thurso can probably be bypassed, to be honest, but makes a useful stop before getting the Orkney ferry
Orkney and Shetland are beautiful, and definitely worth the visit
They're both similar to, and yet quite different from, the rest of Scotland
Students probably, I know there is a good university there but i didn't see that many stereotypical foreign tourists when I have been there (four times I think) maybe because the city is more historical
Lovely food and incredible views, especially the cathedral
I think he meant cold like the attitude rather than the temperature
I was always taught German was the most sensible language to learn because of the size of the German economy
However, I know many people say this is actually quite pointless because those same Germans you’d work with will likely be proficient in English
French is a very useful language if you are interested in working in Africa
German in central Europe but probably Spanish in general especially as conversational level Spanish can very easily become conversational level Italian and Portuguese and with a bit of effort conversational Romanian and French if needed while also being a pretty influential language by itself
I think they also banned importing certain Japanese anime related products because it's too close to Child porn
Margaret Thatcher
There were street celebrations all over Scotland when she died
Historically speaking maybe, Oliver Cromwell or Charles the 1st
Now a days maybe Margret thatcher
Probably Thatcher or if you mean right this moment: big BJ himself
Depends who you ask
William of Orange and Margaret Thatcher are strong candidates though
John Menteith
The first that springs to mind anyway
He betrayed William Wallace aka Brave heart and led to his brutal execution
You can throw that piece of shit Katie Hopkins under the bus along with that jello Petri dish
Maybe the blueshirts leader Duffy
Fascist cunt
Honestly naebody gies that much of a fuck about the royal family unless you're a tabloid journalist or >60
> Unemployment soared to almost Great Depression levels as factory after factory was sacrificed to her cause of monetarist efficiency
Some 20% of the total Scottish workforce lost their jobs in the years 1981 to 1983, with Scottish unemployment regularly 15 to 20% worse than down south, and the government in London only did one thing – they changed the method of calculation so that the figures did not look so bad
Yet still by January, 1985, Scottish unemployment reached 400,000 for the first time since the 1930s.
Aye dev seemed like a tyrant in private tbh, also not a great fan of the theocratic policies he brought in
I remember as a young child, I was told to boo her when she was on TV for closing down the local villages' coal mines and that she was a "very bad lady
" That wasn't by my parents, but the elderly couple who lived next door to us
Thank you kind stranger, that means a lot
Also places in the North of England like Liverpool and Newcastle had a just as bad experience
And Wales
And Northern Ireland (made it even more decisive,  Basically anywhere that wasn't the South of England
And to be honest, that hasn't really changed to this day
I don't know if my answer will count, (probably not), but I've never heard anyone do an actual proper thick-ish Scottish accent correctly
The best fake Scottish accent I've ever heard that I can at least think of is probably Sick Boy from Trainspotting, I was surprised to find out he's actually English
But then again, the accent he was doing isn't exactly thick, and now that I realise he's English I can hear some bits here and there that sound English
Uhm
just don't.
I think with English it's easy to get an accent that rather being definitively non native is more sort of difficult to place
A lot of Europeans who learn English sort of sound like they might be from Eastern Canada but that they might have grown up in Ireland or something
It's hard to work out where they're from if they're fluent enough but they don't sound like they're from any particular place
I dunno about accent cos Ive no heard of anyone whos tried
but our dialect isn't very hard to learn
don't try it, please, please don't. I've heard so many "Scottish" accents done and next to none are good
The only non-Scot I've ever heard do a convincing Scottish accent is Jonny Lee Miller in Trainspotting
I had friends from Poland and learned a little from them
It’s such a hard language, and the best compliment I ever got was ‘you speak Polish well, like you have polish parents but were raised in the UK’
Most people who say the speaking is easy, are usually talking about an American accent
I'd love to hear them say that when listening to me lol
Scottish in particular is hard to emulate
Most folk I know who try to emulate our speech make one major mistake, they speak too slow as they’re too focused on making the correct sounds so they end up sounding ridiculous
We speak fast, and that’s the hardest bit to get right from experience
Most of the people who did were forced to assimilate
It was still a dying language before that too
I'm sure it's only 1
1% speak it nowadays
I’ve left voicemails for family in England and been told ‘I knew it was you because I couldn’t understand a word you said, please speak slower’
Yes
Out of the 37
5 hour working week, I maybe spend 50% of that actually doing work, if I'm lucky
I’d be concerned about any negative economic implications, especially in the recession that’s undoubtedly coming but I would like to see this implemented
I think this would be good for people’s mental health and time with families
Side note: as a nurse I don’t believe there is enough staff available for hospitals and outpatient services to allow for this in healthcare
I used to work 4 days a week 12 hours a day Wednesday through Saturday
It was pretty good tbh, much more spare time as during the days that I work usually that dominates that day if it's 6 hours or 12
&#x200B;
If current projections hold true the work week will likely shift to more of a 30 hour average somewhere in the 2040s from something like a 38 hour average right now so some time in the next 20 years in general as a country we do need to consider moving towards a 4 or even maybe 3 day working week
Not having to do this is the best part of the current lockdown situation imo
Well perhaps for some areas, I don’t see how this would affect routine referrals to outpatient clinics
Why don't we just work 7 days a week and not get paid while we're at it
A six hour week
That’s less than one shift
I would really like to thank Norway for the big christmas tree we get each year
Ik we do thank you each year, bur I personally would like to thank you all
Its one of my favourite traditions, it really touches me tbh
It may only be a christmas tree to most people but its a constant reminder of the history of our two countries, how we've always had each others backs, brothers and sisters across the sea there for each other no matter what
I remember the first time I actually saw it in person, it was night time and looked beautiful I was just flooded with emotion I actually did cry a little
Thank you to all the Norweigans out there, you have a wonderful country and I appreciate all you do for us Brits :)
You need to try Romney's Kendal mint cakes, especially the chocolate covered one
After Eights on steroids
Thank you for the kaassoufflé!
>The English for inventing football
Friendship ended with Wales
Now Ireland is my best friend
We should have an auld alliance visa for scots and French after brexit, just to piss the english off
Appreciate it brother across the sea
Dunno about the other scots but I always wanted to be considered a Nordic country
I speak English and no one understands me outside of Scotland lol
It’s not part of the question but I know people that can speak Scots Gaelic can sort of muddle through Irish Gaelic and vice versa
It’s a case of same but different
As a speaker of Brazilian Portuguese I understand the Spaniards better than the Portuguese
Dont be, I really should slow down when I speak lol
Oh yeah that's true, mind you if you joined us and became part of Scotland we might actually have a decent football team lol
Haha no we are both too lazy to adapt at very least, I used to work with a German girl she was married to someone from near my hometown and could understand me
I got a bit of a surprise the first time lol
&#x200B;
Never seen Broadchurch but I think that was Dorset
Could work aye
Doctor who might be a place to start, it's fun
I should relearn German I used to know some from school
It's not a telephone box, that's a disguise lol
Everyday as a fellow English speaking nation we get the stream of American news continuously
As a result I think we are more easily affected by whatever political/media situations are happening on your side of the pond
I don't like it or want it, Fox news etc are some of the worst creations of man
Nearly daily, especially in an election year
UK BBC TV News covers more American politics than it does Scottish
Not that often
Only when Trump does something stupid or there is some big event like a protest
We have enough shit of our own happening over here with COVID, Brexit and everything else
Channel 4 news in particular seems absolutely obsessed with America
> or r/whitepeopletwitter
Well, there's your problem, a "white people twitter" is a very American (or Canadian) concept to begin with
I have noticed this race sickness in the Anglo-Celtic world (USA, Canada, UK, Australia, NZ)
Race is a constant topic, it's mentioned all the time, it's in everyone's minds, always
Having a "whitepeopletwitter" should be as absurd as having a "brown eyed people twitter", that's how absurd the situation is
Go on /r/politics, /r/canada, /r/australia, /r/newzealand, or /r/unitedkingdom
There is a thread about race all the fucking time
It's always something about "white people do this", "brown people be that", yada yada
I feel like I'm losing my fucking mind, but I've reached the point where I get apoplectic whenever a friend of mine feels like bringing up someone's race when it's unnecessary (e.g. we were discussing the American electoral college, and my friend said "they're a bunch of old *white* guys", as if the flaws present in the system are somehow related to skin colour or representation, as opposed to it simply being a quaint and antiquated system that would function the same way it does now regardless of race)
**Too long; didn't read**: race consciousness exists, and it's cancerous
But we can digest it easier, the Brit can read anything printed in the states directly as its in his native tongue compared to any other nationality since they either have to read it in their second language or its filter through a translation which is often edited
Brits however get full exposure especially to the smaller ones that are not CNN etc since they would unlikely be covered in translated news
I imagine that breitbart is much more shared on UK SM compared to French SM
> he US news is covered just as much in other European countries as it is in the UK
True, but many young Europeans speak English as well, so they've become part of the "english speaking" market
It's not a recent development, elections have always been "entertainment drama"
Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, those high brow, stoic, intellectual academics who led the USA in its fights for Independence
They accused each other of being Hermaphrodites and Rapists during their contested election
Yep
It's especially noticeable when countries like New Zealand (only 4 million people) get WAY more coverage than countries like Indonesia (200+ million
Tbh if you go far back enough to the 6th century, the English and Dutch would also share a lot of common ancestry (iirc Frisian is the closest language to English, outside of Scots or Patois languages)
> People have opininos about US politics in a way they would never have about the internal politics of another country - I would say that for the average Dane, the US political system is familiar but the one in neighboring Germany, a very important country, is quite obscure in comparison
Exact same issue in the UK
The average person, Scottish or English, seems to be more invested in the USA than in their own local politics sometimes
People barely know anything about internal politics in France, or our Commonwealth cousins in Canada and Australia, but EVERYONE has an opinion on internal American matters (some of which are surprisingly obscure)
I think Brexit was the point where I realised that I felt more European than British
When I found out the result of the referendum I was devastated, and it felt like a betrayal
My hope is that in the long term, people will realise that nationality is not important (cultural identity is)
I think the EU is the best chance we have of achieving this at present
In so far as making a new European superstate, no
I also think that would be a poor idea, and likely cause breakaways as countries happy to be in an international organisation face electoral backlash at being annexed into a larger state, and the surrender of powers that entails for already more peripheral countries
Like, quite a lot of countries don't take EU elections seriously because they don't feel like it ever matters or changes, it s more like polling for the next GE
There's also the question of if countries that have a history of trying for their own independence would be happy being in a singular nation dominated by Germany and France
While there is some pan-European identity, it's very broad strokes, and I heavily doubt it's enough to weld a new nation together
Maybe France, Germany, and the Benelux region, I wonder if an independent Scotland would want to be dominated by conservative Germans with different political and cultural ideals in the same way we complain about the English, who are culturally and politically a lot more like us
Similarly, I expect that to play out with a few of the countries on the periphery who are happy for cooperation but not becoming a minor territory of a new state
Also, in general the idea of making yet another superstate, like the US, China, seems pretty terrible, they are inherently a lot less democratic and responsive to the population due to their size and don't have a good record when it comes to throwing their weight around
I vastly prefer the EUs farmers cooperative current model to trying to make it into the corporate farming conglomerate that a superstate would be
The former seems a lot fairer and sustainable than the latter
I would definitely disagree about stonehenge
At least for me it was much bigger and more impressive than I expected, and it's more about the history than the sight itself anyway
Me and my mum did one of those open top bus tours through Copenhagen
The little mermaid stop was so overcrowded and busy we didn’t even get off the bus there
I find that Edinburgh is a little the same, there's an awful lot of tourist shops blaring bagpipes with cheap kilts and weird ginger wigs, although there are lovely parts the city centre doesn't really represent Scotland
The only people I know who go to Ayia Napa are people looking for a cheaper version of Ibiza/Magaluf
> I once rented a villa in the middle of nowhere next to a goat farm up a hill somewhere
This is genuinely the most hipster thing I have ever read in my life
There's these wee guys down south who have been a bit of a pain in the neck for about
a thousand years
England, even our national animal is the unicorn because it is the one animal said to be able to beat a lion
Equatorial Guinea
England, Us Scots love to moan about our neighbour
I mean, I have to put England
England
y'all know why
England and the other half of Scotland
I mean we like yah, mutual hatred of the English
Everyone else seems to hate you though
I'm sure it *has* happened, but it's not a well known hazard
Drunk people trying to cook, falling asleep and burning the house down has inspired a few Public Safety Announcements though
Also the vast majority of people won't try and go for a shower while drunk enough to pass out standing up
at least Finnish people have hygiene standards even when completely out of it I guess
Take a fuck load of coke probably
Showers are for the morning after to nurse the hangover and regret decisions made the night before
For me it’s Stirlingshire
I know that we have a massive castle that overlooks the entire county but ffs there’s fuck all tae dae in this god forsaken town isn’t there
Aye Bridge of Allan may have a nice wee chippy but everyone in Bridge of Allan’s an arsehole
Nae smiles from anyone who passes by, not to mention the over-abundance of neds

> I remember last year some English pals of mine went on a trip to Ibiza and the photos and videos they shared were of them in places surrounded by other Brits where everything was in English
Did they go to Ibiza to party
That's probably the reason why they went to the likes of San Antonia/Playa Den Bossa
Outside of those two places, Ibiza is actually a stunning island
Benidorm is basically where all the neddy/chavy folk from the UK go
Thank god though, because it means they bypass Alicante and leave it untouched for the rest of us
That's why you get drunk before you go to the clubs and DON'T buy alcohol once you're in there
Glad you enjoyed it
And I plan to move to the Highlands at some point but I’m still in school so I don’t have much of an option rn lol
I once went to the customs office here in Frankfurt to get a parcel a friend sent me
They asked what was in it and I, an idiot, said, "ein Gift" - then I remembered that means poison in German and freaked out apologising
The worker was clearly used to foreigners making this same dumb mistake and just looked bored by me dying inside, so it was fine
Also aktuell (current) v actual (real/truly existing)
Also very nitpicky but the -chs isn't pronounced like a hard X as in the English sex, is it
Yeh Scotland's a pretty great place to live
Wouldn't want to leave forever
I love Living in Scotland
but if we don't shift that lot from down South and I had to consider moving it would be Germany or Czech Republic for sure
Fell in love with both places as soon as I visited
I used to
Then Brexit happened and I feel further and further away from a country I grew up in every day
My plans are to relocate to German at some point in the next year or two
Are you from Slovenia
If not, how did you find learning the language
I visited Slovenia a couple of years ago and it is by far my most favourite country, I’d love to live there
A Scottish person not pining for warmer weather
I'd say pretty good
No natural disasters, the weather is
consistent
We weren’t that bad (not speaking for England)
I married a foreigner (German) and she wanted to move back, but once you've moved once it's much easier to do it again
So now I'm in Netherlands where I get paid more, the job's more interesting, the work life balance is better and so is the weather
I don't think I could justify taking my family back and loosing all those perks
Scottish weather is crap, we do have amazing hills and lochs but the rain changes plans so often
Most people here are about the pub lifestyle
> I don't think I could justify taking my family back and loosing all those perks
Ach
I feel you
We are in the process of moving from the Netherlands back to Scotland
There's a lot that we'll miss
But after a while I just felt homesick
We get clear skies <10 times a year
Looking at the forecast for the next 2 weeks, not a single day isn't cloudy
As a comparison on the west coast of Scotland we got 1250 mm of rain and in NL you get about 750 mm where I live now
My first year at uni it rained everyday from the 1st of September till the last day of April without fail, except for the 2 weeks it fell as snow
The Netherlands is a tropical paradise compared to Scotland
It makes me laugh when the Dutch complain about the weather
The biggest difference is the Scottish darkness, which makes any bad weather just seem worse
I will have the legal right to stay since I arrived before the 1st of January as will most Brits who live in Europe before 2021 but that's up to the country they live in
I would also qualify as a young person with a STEM background (mechanical engineering) so I was never worried I would be kicked out per say
It's more the betrayal of the British government for stripping away all these rights I have that is more disappointing
Long-term I will probably get a Dutch passport or if Scotland becomes independent and in the EU swap my British one for that
Bit of an exaggeration, weather is shite and its been shite for a while but almost every day in May was beautiful sunshine and heat
I see you're in Germany - very happy to swap
Respect and fraternal greetings to Iceland
Oh yes there are many ignorant Brits who happily swallowed down the poison by the Tories and Media including my grandparents
But I blame the ringleaders themselves much more, Bojo is the most distructive minister the UK has had in 100 years
Them twinned with the media are an atrocity on British life
They believe optics is the only thing that matters while they try to turn London into a bankers Singapore paradise while the outer lands are left to rot
"Dae a jobby"
The J word will give any scottish person a nice chuckle
Ladas are popular with some rural farmers because they are really sturdy and easy to repair
They were never particularly popular, and were often the subject of jokes for being crude and low quality
Thanks to a couple of segments on Top Gear, their reputation has been partly recovered, and they're also thought of as being rugged and durable (whilst still being the butt of jokes about dodgy cars)
Light beer isn't really a thing in England either
Was he possibly trying to translate *Helles*?
If you're not tanning a full pint of shitty lager by the time you're 14 in the UK you get your citizenship revoked
Yeah, it's the German way too and it gets on my tits
Just go, fucker, you'll be past in two seconds, which is way faster than I take to awkwardly walk-run it
I'm not sure what it's like in England, but I'm sure in Scotland the person not wearing the seatbeat also gets a fine now too
Bud light or Coors are probably the two most popular light beers in the UK
Certainly round my neck of the woods Bud Light has gained more popularity in the last year or so
It tends to be a lighter coloured than a normal beer/lager
I regularly see girls here in Manchester on Saturday nights sitting on the ground, wasted, by 10pm
Really glad you posted this 26 times
I didn’t quite get your meaning the first 25 attempts
I guessed it must have been something like that
Hahahahaha
It's cool, I'm flattered to get so many responses
Ah, good ‘ol German folktales
They never fail to bring a smile to a child, and a look of abject horror to an adult
When I was growing up it was common to be told the story of the “Old Sea Captain”.
The child is blindfolded and led upstairs into a darkened room where they get to meet the “Old Captain”. The old Captain can not speak since his tongue was cut out so the adults then tell this awful story of how he was betrayed by his first mate
They tell of his wooden leg, and let you feel the rough texture of it (a walking stick in actuality)
Then they tell of how he lost his eye gruesomely and put a marble in your hands
Eventually at the end they take your finger and out it into his “empty eye socket”. The whole time you thought it was fake but they put your finger into half of an orange
You suddenly think it’s real
This is when the kids normally scream and run away tearing at the  blindfold
Which of course makes the other kids waiting downstairs more terrified
You then have to promise not to tell
It’s all mysterious and horrifying
I was the last one to “meet” him that time
Obviously it only works once but it’s a bit of a family “rite of passage”.
Boris just coughs on everyone and wins
Definetely Bojo, he has a mean rugby tackle
*Bagpipe music hits*
Bah Gawd
Nicola Sturgeon is here to cash in money in the bank briefcase
Nicola runs her toe up the crack of Boris’ arse and goes for the pin
but no
The EU stable pummel Nicola with a steel chair
That’s sick that woman has a family dammit
EU stable members group-plex Nicola through the Spanish announce table
What’s this
Sneaky roll up pin by Liechtenstein 1
It’s a faction of allied wrestlers, like the nWo
No, go classic and give her a Churchill Crocodile
alright pal/mate is more of a greeting than a question but some people seem confused when I say it to a non Scottish person and they'll take it as a question
To an extent, given that I am from Edinburgh so my accent isn't very strong, and I don't dislike the English or support independence - which on Reddit is unusual
I’m northern English but I grew up mostly in Scotland
I’m too Scottish to be English, but too English to be Scottish at the same time
I’m also half German, so got that extra bit of foreign and I really struggle with my identity at the moment, especially with the way things are in the country at the moment
The midge:
Yes and no
I worked in Spain and loved it, the sun, wine and the festivals just made me think why the hell I'm I still in Scotland
In Spain I stick out though, 6'4, white skin and blonde and ginger beard
It's a national pastime in Scotland
The pub in Britain is a core part of our culture, on Fridays they are heaving
Alcohol consumption is not frowned upon and while there is a learning curve on drinking where younger people get drunk more often it's not uncommon to see 50+ year olds struggling to walk in the city centre on a weekend
That’s only 1 bottle of wine or less per person in a space of 4/5 hours
That would be seen as taking it easy here lol
I think the Celts would out drink the English and after that it would just be an enjoyable night out that ends with a dropped kebab and vomit in a plant pot
> (At least from French Germans Italians I know they are into moderate social drinking
Taking a walk down Dusseldorf altstadt on a Friday or a Saturday night will put to rest any notions that German people are into moderate social drinking
Why does this happen
Is it because we were outdoors more often when we were younger, or because our recollections are warped
I've heard the same thing said about loads of animals, from snails and slugs to foxes and deer
I've noticed I haven't seen any roadkill badgers for ages
but there hasn't been culling in Scotland
[And according to this article there are more now than there have been in most peoples lifetimes]
> Battered burgers
Pretty much every chippy in Scotland still does battered burgers
I wrote a long comment about the history of the Romani people and the euphemism treadmill
but really it all comes down to this
A slur not used in an insulting way is not really a slur, and the reasons the word 'gypsy' has gained negative connotations for some will not go away if we use a different word
As far as the endonym/exonym argument goes, many Romani people in the UK (where the word comes from) self-identify as gypsies
Since these groups left the Indian subcontinent a thousand years ago, their languages have remained (despite widespread attempts at suppression)
Language is not just a tool, it is our history
When we say the word gypsy, we echo hundreds of years of oppression and wonder, fear of the unknown but also curiosity and romanticism
We can choose to say this word and be mindful of all that history, just as we say the word Black or Jew or whatever
As mentioned in the article, a culprit could be more aerodynamic cars
>irrational fears
Not if you're from Rotherham hoho
In Scotland you occasionally see small ones, erected within the grounds of churches
They tend to be 'nice' in tone (e.g. Jesus loves everyone) and are there to advertise that particular church
Sometimes religious groups occasionally pay for public advertising, but it's not very widespread at all, and when it does happen, it's usually the smaller, more evangelical sects with American roots
E.g. Jehovah's witnesses
Nothing on an American scale, and nothing on the roadside, but I have seen advertising signs at railway stations in the UK saying promoting various (mostly conservative-evangelical) Christian churches and ministries
There was one, in Scotland, on the side of the M80 Highway, It said that God protects us or something
As a native [Scottish English] speaker, who has also been exposed to [Scots] I found quite a lot of familiar words in Scandinavian languages
Two Scots words that come to mind as being very Scandinavian are 'braw' (good) and 'bairn' (child)
For Glasgow: Buckfast induced football violence along vaguely religious lines
For the rest of the country: beer induced regular violence
People that care more about our union with England than our actual country
Given Glasgow's links to Ireland, added in with the fact we have a decent number of students living in the city who are Irish, there are certain pubs in the city centre that this happens in
I remember the first time I seen it and it was just so nice
It started off like 3 people playing some instruments and by the time me and my mates were moving on there was about 13 people all sitting round the table
You and us both
I think we might see a mini boom for the pubs once this is all over
Seriously, all anyone I know can talk about is how buzzing they are to go to the pub once they open back up (and I include myself in that)
It is upsetting to see establishments close because of Covid-19
But whenever I see comments about businesses closing down I’m reminded about a comment a read months ago when airlines were under strain and that was that the demand and the skill set is still going to exist once this is over
Pubs will survive
The Park Bar in Finnieston is also great for trad music on a Saturday night
It's a bit more organised than the informal sessions you get in places like the Liosmore, but it's always heaving
Fish and chips (i.e. fried battered haddock with chunky fries as some of you like to call it)
Macaroni pie
Probably fish and chips or anything else you can get from a chippy, especially a munchy box
Bridies, I think
Curry
Glasgow invented the tikki masala, 'nuff said
Probably a deep fried pizza or deep fried haggis
edit: I just forgot about fish and chips as well, but I'm not sure if that counts as much as the deep fried pizza and deep fried haggis
Or a pie
Munchybox is also a solid choice for Scotland
I'd associate munchy boxes with Indian/Doner takeways more than I'd associate them with anything else
Indians have been selling them for a lot longer
It's only really been in the last 3 years or so that Chinese's, chippys et all have jumped on the bandwagon
I'd say a roll and sausage (often with a fried egg, potato scone, black pudding or even bacon) from a burger van/roll shop are just as popular, if not more popular, than pies
The list is endless in Scotland let’s be honest man
For me a good snack on the go, so falls under fast food for me
Aye but I wouldn't say that indian places are our national fast food, idk if that makes sense
You see a large mix of Scotland and UK flags here
Much much less than the US, but much more than in England for example
Nah we're very patriotic
See a fair deal of Scottish and UK flags depending on which area you live in
Sometimes you see those cringe Scotland/EU ones too, and our Royak Standard, both tend to be indicators of political affiliations
Here flying either the union jack or a saltire is more a statement of your political intent (union or independence) so its not uncommon but quite rare
Not really
If anything, scottish flags have gotten more popular
Having one is relatively normal, having clothing with a Scottish flag on it somewhere is extremely common
Displaying one isn't weird but it's slightly unusual, I wouldn't think anything particular or someone displaying one
Generally the most common time you see them displayed is in pubs but you also see them on public buildings, at sporting events, on or in churches and in protests
My area exclusively has Scottish flags, both of them, ‘cause it’s a really pro independence area
They’re also spray painted everywhere and there’s yes stickers on pretty much every lamppost
Yeah and it depends on where you are too
I see more Scottish and European flags but I guess in a unionist area there might be more Uk flags
I’d say there’s more flag flying in general in Glasgow than anywhere else
It’s still definitely not a common thing
Maybe not the most famous but this photo called [‘children of the gorbals’] is a very famous photo in Scotland
It shows children out playing in the Slums of the Gorbals in Scotland in the late 50s, the city was so called the ‘2nd city of the empire’ but yet a majority of its population didn’t have bathroom access up until the 1970s with entire families living in single roomed Victorian slums
As much as the conditions were slum like the areas had high community spirit, something that was stomped out of Glasgow after the demolition of the tenements and construction of the tower blocks which caused social problems and high crime rates due to the lack of jobs or community centres that were built with them
The city council cared more about housing people than making good areas to live something that to this day has had the affect of having some areas in Glasgow have average life expectancy as low as 3rd world countries
The photo reminds people of a simpler time when life was tough but people for the most part were happy having good neighbours and a strong community, something that Glasgow needs more of
I left the UK in 2013 (good move) and came back in 2020 (what a mistake)
I'm amazed that salaries have not increased, but costs certainly have
The squeeze on living standards over the last decade is real - and it needs to stop
One thing I’ve always found odd any time I’ve been to Germany in the last few years is that the staff in the bars tend to wear little pouches where the keep money
I’ve never seen that happen in any other country:
Granted I’ve only been to central Amsterdam twice, but I never noticed a litter problem there
I fully appreciate that’s where the tourists go though so they might make more of an effort to keep it clean and that it could well be a lot worse outside of that area
That being said, West Central Scotland has a disgusting problem with litter
It really is something I find shameful about living here
My god that is grim
You'd fit well in Scotland too
The only time of proper peace between me and my southern friends has been the last 300 years
before that was nasty
This is why I voted to remain in the European Union - not the only reason, but certainly one of the main reasons
In the UK we still tend to talk about our weight in terms of stone which is equivalent to 14 pounds
It’s a bit old fashioned but widely used
For example, I’m a nurse and if I take a weight in kg my patients will always shake their heads, saying they don’t know what that means and asking me to convert into stones
A "bawhair"* is usually used to define a distance that is really small
Eg: That car just missed hitting me by a bawhair
&nbsp;
*Bawhair = Pube
We have the gill and the dram, which are traditional measures for spirits, mainly whisky
And of course we have our own cultural relative units
For large areas that would usually be Wales ("an area 3 times the size of Wales"), and for money it's the price of a Celtic season ticket
That's odd because I'm young and only know my weight in kilograms
Interesting
I know my weight in kilograms but not in stones
Yes, I’d agree with that
It seems odd when Americans talk of weighing hundreds of pounds
Yeah, I literally said it was old fashioned
We have a ridiculous hybrid system when it comes to measurements
I just wish we’d commit and go full on metric but I imagine nowadays that would be seen as far too European
Most of the early railways were built by canal engineers, so a lot of the terminology would have crossed over
Couldn’t agree more
I mean, I’d rather we used kg if honest but the idea often portrayed here, as you point out, just isn’t true
As a nurse in an outpatient clinic, it’s really rather rare for me to come across someone comfortable with kg
Divide your weight in pounds by 14
You now know your weight in stones
Europe has a rich history, there are natural and man made wonders but I think we also have to split man made wonders into ancient and modern, that creates a new perspective on it I think
Went last October to see QUB with me madre and went on a lil N.I day tour and it's actually such a fun wee trip out
Salt mine is class
I think he means like, cultural wonder
I don't think he's saying it's good but he's saying its important to visit
Hope not anyway
No but the point being is its an incredible place to visit
Is what he's saying a wonder is your right normally a good thing but it's of huge cultural significance
It's cultural history in a way because that's a part of history
That was Nazi culture
No, I know I'm explaining it the way he said it
It's culturally significant to the history of Jewish people and nazism and WW2
Don't be rude to me just because you disagree
I'm just trying to explain what the original poster meant
It is a culturally significant place, I'm sorry you disagree
I was annoyed at Gaelic and my father's attempts to teach it to me growing up
I saw it as a distraction and mostly an irrelevance to a kid growing up in a council flat in a big city
These days it's become extremely important to me and I wish I had learned it as a child so I wouldn't have to spend at much time working on it today
Mountains and twisty roads
Used to hate them because they made me feel sick but now they're kind of nice lol
I feel it's become a bigger part of Scottish identity than when I was a kid in the 90s when it was mostly seen as a rural thing spoken by incestuous religious zealots but what with devolution and the end of the decline of the language as well as government policies to promote it
It's also gotten a lot more international recognition as a part of Scotland in movies, books and TV shows
I think today a lot more people know a bit of Gaelic than 20 years ago but rates of fluency are still around 1 to 1
5%.
Tha mi gu math, tha mi ochd bliadhna fichead a dh aois
Gur math a theid leat
Aye though it's a lot more spoken in Ireland with your schooling system and stuff
In a perfect world I'd hope that Scotland adapts a Gaelic teaching system similar to Ireland in the next 20 years
Chan eil mi fileanta ann am Gàidhlig ach tha mo Gàidhlig math
Aye, luckily the terminal decline Gaelic had been going through from 1746 to 2000 has been at least somewhat stopped now and numbers have remained a little bit more stable these last 20 years than the 250 years before said they should be
Chan eil an-diugh, duilich
Chanainn "feabhas".
Oh well, sigh
But Ireland still has a system where pretty much everyone has some knowledge of Irish
I think it could be fairly quickly turned around though
I mean I think the political will to educate all children in a degree of Gaelic would not be too hard to manufacture especially with the current Scottish political situation
We already turned around Scots from a dying language/dialect to a commonly understood one in a similar way
Nah there's absolutely no option for it in probably 95% of schools
Even schools in Gaelic speaking areas sometimes don't offer it
This is the legacy of a long term policy of the British government, reversed in 2005 to try and promote English over Gaelic
I mean I'd be good if it was offered as a choice subject or even just lessons that didn't make up a grade where everyone got an hour a week of Gaelic lessons or something
I mean the SNP is generally pro-Gaelic though I worry a lot of their idea of it is using it as a nationalistic token to make Scotland more distinct than it already is
I think if it begins to really die again though they'll take some action to preserve it, assuming that is that their national level politicans don't go on incoherent rants about how Gaelic is islamophobic again
I think due to the geographic isolation of the western isles Gaelic will survive as a community language indefinitely especially on the southern isles of the outer Hebrides
I think it's time as a community language on the small section of the mainland where it remains is numbered though

Oh yeah it wasn't even that it was associated with right wing nationalism, luckily we've been able to avoid most of that
What is was called islamophobic for was that it was taking away money from promoting the use of Urdu among the Pakistani community in Glasgow
Wait where did you get those statistics
What I've seen seems to suggest that it is stabalising significantly relative to the last 100 years

Max Burger from Sweden, since I first went there no other burger chain matters to me
Any Curry Wurst chain please open up in Scotland please and thank you
Not a brand but when I was in Ios in Greece several years back they had they had the most amazing vegetarian gyros
Hot flatbread with chips, fresh tzatziki and salad for €1
We need something like that here
Lol still have my Hotmail account too
Yeah but it's not called hotmail any more
It's outlook now
They obviously mean for personal use
Because they're talking about personal email addresses, not business one
They mention tech illiterate users with hotmail and their mum, why would you assume they're talking about business domains
Scotland:
England obviously, most of our history is about our relationship with them
France the auld alliance, helped us counter England
Ireland our Celtic brothers and share similar relationship with England
Norway some Vikings came over and were difficult to remove
5 a little less clear, maybe Netherlands and bringing over Protestantism
Or another Scandinavian country
We didn't really have a issue with Spain like England or were involved with continental affairs like with the HRE until the union of the crowns
Or I suppose Italy if you include the Romans
The country that has had the most historical influence in Scotland, outside the British Isles, is France, without any doubt
England
France
Lowlands (Benelux)
Jamaica
Norway
- England (obviously)
- France (the Auld Alliance)
- Ireland (Ulster Scots)
- Germany (World Wars)
- India (empire)
Honorable mentions
- The Baltic nations for pre-empire trade
- Italy for the Romans and recent immigration
- Panama for the Darien Scheme
- Canada for emigration during and after the clearances
- Poland for post-war immagration
For Scotland probably:
1: England
2: France
3: Canada
4: Ireland
5: Norway
England
Ireland

I'd put Germany over Norway, and I say this as someone whose family is literally from Orkney (where the Norwegians settled)
The Protestant Reformation had a huge impact on the course of our history, so Martin Luther kickstarting that is a big deal (even though we are technically Calvinists rather than Lutherans)
> The USA are important because from the 18th century on they have been the prime destination for emigrants from Germany and to this day they are transfigured as a sort of holy land (subconsciously, I think Winnetou novels and cowboy movies also contributed to that motion)
I have noticed that Germans pay a lot more attention to the USA than other (non-Anglophone) countries seem to
I browse /r/france and /r/de, and whereas /r/france largely ignores the Americans, I see US related posts on /r/de more frequently
I guess it's too limited of a sample size to really draw any conclusions, but it feels like the French actively try to avoid "American issues", while Germans actively discuss American matters
Granted, these days 90% of US related topics on /r/de are very negative and basically boil down to "why are Americans stupid
" But it feels like Germans genuinely want this question answered, whereas the French will just say it for laughs and then move on
I think that's probably because you were the bigger partner and had "bigger fish to fry". An alliance with a relatively small country in Europe particularly one not on the mainland I can imagine is easily looked over when you are studying the 100 year war etc
I know I live in Netherlands, I meant another Scandinavian country refering to number 4 Norway
IMO the issue is that we affected their history, but they didn't necessarily affect us in an equal manner
The Scottish diaspora in Zimbabwe certainly left its mark (Ian Smith was from a Scottish family I think
), but Zimbabwe's influence on Scotland is minimal
It's a bit like how Spain is a huge influence on a country like Honduras, but Honduras is not a huge influence on Spain
That's maybe a fairer suggestion, I think dispora is probably best fit although a bit of a cheat
It is telling though that there is approximately 5 million Scots in Scotland but anywhere between 30 and 40 million people worldwide with Scottish lineage
I think Canada has a higher proportion though (correct me if I'm wrong)
> The US are also a major topic in school
Students spend about two years learning about the us (if you combine all subjects)
That's more than about every other country, except Germany
That's surprising
I thought you'd learn more about France or another European country more
Salty cos u keep losing
I think it’s the nature of this sub
Most people on here have a strong connection to a European identity, which is why they are here
I think a good comparison of how different attitudes are on here to the general population is a poll that was done recently on this sub asking things on the line of “would you like to see a United European state”, with the results in the region of 70-90% yes
Irl the highest these polls ever get in any European country is 30%
If you want no culture and speaking English all the time, why not just emigrate to America
I support Ireland cos Irish people have better patter than England
When we go independent I’ll support Scotland, but right now Ireland, cos they’re just as mental as us
I get that
That’s part of the reason I put “Scotland” as my flair instead of “United Kingdom”. People on this sub seem to know that Scotland didn’t vote for brexit, so there’s no real shame for me
I mean, I *also* support Scottish independence and identity much more as Scottish than I do British, so I probably would’ve put Scotland regardless, but the brexit thing was a factor
Your everything wrong with Scottish Independence
They’re everywhere here
Oh, so this is where the "John Paul rapes children" meme comes from
My Polish friends keep spamming this shit on our group chats at fucking 4 in the morning
This thread is so enlightening
My Polish friends are always spamming pictures of ballsack nosed monkeys and "John Paul rapes children" at silly o' clock hours in our group chats, now I finally understand what they all mean
r/de has that too
but for Wednesday, rather than Friday
> Oh, and the "silly hour", when most cenzopapas are posted, is 21:37, an hour when John Paul II died
Fucking hell, this really does explain everything hahaha
That "Neptune's Kiss" illustration is a thing of wonder, beauty and horror
Its definetely England
We ALWAYS bicker and fight, but in the end we are so similar
Behind all the jokes theres a legitimate fondness
Besides, making fun of the English is our thing
We can do it all day, but if anyone else tries it you'll be told where to go
It's England
Because you can choose your friends, but you're stuck with your brothers
I think it depends on who's closest
For me personally it's the Netherlands
I love you guys
I'll always love you
You also got the best plants <3
I’d have to say Ireland, both North and South
Some people are saying England but let’s not forget, Scotia wasn’t originally England, it was Ireland
Same sports (Hurling and Shinty), same drinks (Whisky and Whiskey), we both like St Columba (Colm Cille), same language (Gàidhlig agus Gaelige), same stupid response from Americans and English people [(case in point)] when we speak English, and we are both big fans of the Bucky, although for some reason Irish people have it in brown bottles
Wales and Scotland, we both hate England in our own ways
Ireland, France
Just historical, plus recent events have highlighted there's a lot we have in common
Ireland, those guys have similar culture, are the same   type of people, celts
And we have close ties
And both hate the English,  heh
When Scotland faced Ireland in the Euros 2016 qualifiers away, the song went [‘We hate England, we hate England, we hate England more than you, we hate England more than you’]
Most of us dont want independence, it's just a loud vocal minority that whinge about that
The kind of people that think Braveheart was a documentary
You're alright by us, except maybe London
And at least you're not French at any rate
Ireland would be Scotland's friend, England our brother
After all, you can choose your friends
Northern Ireland is Scotlands child for sure
We share lots of cultural ties and similarities
Due to sectarianism being ever present in our western communities Ireland wouldnt be a safe pick
It probably should surprise you as, frankly, they're incorrect
There's a reason all the recent polls about Independence largely sit relatively close to 50/50 and it's not that one side of it is just an online vocal minority
Also the whole comment about Braveheart was probably a pretty good way to tell they're not actually discussing this in good faith
I say this as someone who voted No in 2014
They have a strong online presence, but the statistics speak for themselves
I'm confused, what statistics are those
As far as I'm aware it's still pretty much 50/50
Personally I'm all for independence and so are many people I know
It's definitely not just a whinging minority haha
As you'll be aware 55-45 was the referendum result, with polls showing a decrease in favour of independence since
There was an artificial rise after brexit but it quickly dissipated again
Got some bad news for you pal
I dont think you do tbh
Oh I do, it's good news for Scotland though - you'll surely agree
TIL German doesn't discriminate between Gorillas and Guerillas when it comes to warfare

Northern Ireland-
Narrator- It wasn’t a better idea
Edit states that in Romania, if you have a job you are expected to help with expenses
This is exactly the same as what happens in the UK
No one calls it ‘rent’. It’s not a financial obligation
We calling it ‘paying digs’ and it’s just helping with household expenditure
It’s normally people who have a job and aren’t in education but still live with parents
People at uni or college usually won’t pay digs
I paid my patents £100 a month when I started a full time job
If I was ever in trouble they would of course help me out and wouldn’t take the money
I’m British, and I’ve never heard of this happening around here
It's not called rent, but many parents here start charging what we call "dig money" when their kids start earning a full time wage (mostly after they turn 18) and they are still living at home
Each family does different things with that money
Mine, for example, put it towards the grocery shopping and some household bills
It tends to be seen more as a contribution to the running of the household rather than charging them to live there
Me ans my parents agreed I'd pay 'rent' for the year between school and uni when I was working, largely because that year they were losing the income of Child Tax Credit (or w/e its called) from me and my twin brother, and were sort of hard up continuing to support even just having me stay around
It was very cheap (£100 or so a month, plus any fuel for rides into work, which I avoided by cycling) and didn't even attempt to try and replace the credit or living costs, but it just helped to keep things ticking over
In the latter half of uni (so the last two years) they've helped me out when I got worried about money with a hundred a month
So it works out and is just putting money where its needed most at that moment to keep us all going
I'm curious how many get charged an actual full rent versus how many get a cheap 'rent' which is basically just a small contribution to shared living costs
None of your mates ever spoke about their parents taking dig money off them
Well I think there’s a difference between paying a landlord rent which has been defined in a legal contract opposed to giving your mum and dad a bit of money to pay towards your share of expenses
In Scotland we make that distinction
It's what my family called it
Up here every I know calls it dig money/digs
Jesus, that’s harsh
You could have rented your own place for that lol
Eh, my family didn't. Nor did several of my friends families
It was just called paying rent, even though there was no legal contract or comparable cost to me
Some people some places use some different words
S'fine
Huh, well there you go
Could be a regional thing
Maybe
I've heard it referred to as board and rent, so I really think it just differs from person to person and the dialects/people they interact with
Who knows, all three are correct in my books
I don’t think so
There’s a cat at Downing Street in London where the Prime Minister lives
I really wish there was some kind of movement to just redo the spelling of the English language because it’s so fucking stupid and inconsistent
A recently heard someone say that the Dutch are just Germans who drink tequila
I don’t know if you actually wanted an answer to this or not but here it is
The r in “particular” isn’t silent, but most English accents don’t fully articulate an R if it comes after a vowel
I don’t know why they do that, but it is just an accent thing
I would like to give a big thanks to France for the many times we have aided each other on the battlefield

I'm just gonna thank Malta for being extremely kind, helpful, friendly place to a visiting Scot
Especially the two short known Maltese friends who took time off work to show me the sights: I would never have been able to see as much of that country and loved it as much as I now do without the insane amount of additional, unasked for labour they undertook
Cheers, you wonderful little island
France, for all the historical alliances against England
Also Croatia because I'm getting married there next year
poland for nice people and tasty food and drink
Italy for pizza, France for beer, Spain for seafood and Russia for the song *dash cam*.
A personal thank you to Germany, for hosting my internship and Erasmus, giving me a taste foot personal independence and living abroad
I'd also like to thank the Poles for helping defend the UK during the Battle of Britain
I know they were *really* fighting to win their homeland back, but many laid down their lives and in doing so helped protect our civilians and infrastructure
I also choose France
For the above reasons, plus also for still being hot in September
Had a nice craft beer from France once
Best seafood I ever had was in a traditional restaurant in Spain

No because a lot of Scots speak English with lots of Scots language mixed in so it’s a bit more than just colloquialisms
So writing in standard English sometimes just doesn’t convey the message or what is being said
You'd be a funny cunt in person but i bet you feel gie castrated online without the accent carrying it
american politics for some reason, at least in my household anyway
The news paper my great auntie gets is absolutely plastered with american news to the point she talks about it like we're voting for our own prime minister
Except it wasn't a true and full ban (if its rape, you can have an abortion), because that would mean it breaks human rights
All you can do is hope that PiS blocks people from leaving the country to have abortions and then you can bring the case to the ECHR
> Feminine hygiene products not being classed as essential is the even more controversial issue
They are, Tesco fucked up
[Welsh Government put a statement out about it] anything sold in a pharmacy is considered essential
Yup I remember when PiS took over the courts making the country extremely undemocratic without an independent Judiciary
Surprised it took so long for something like this to happen
And the EU can do nothing about it
Human rights are outside their jurisdiction, the updated Constitution technically keeps to human rights anyways, and anything the EU do to prevent PiS' takeover is vetoed and blocked by Hungary
Now it does, yes
It was tied between Ireland and Poland with the UK close behind
But since Ireland made it completely legal and Poland did this
Poland is by far the strictest with the UK second behind
Lukcily leaving the EU is different to the Council of Europe and we have to keep human rights because I know if that were the case and the wrong people were elected in this country, you'd see a complete ban in the UK
Honestly
I hope she advocates more
It might make PiS slip up and ban abortion outright which would bring the ECHR down to bear on Poland
Breaking human rights isn't cheap, and it might make PiS finally realise how much of an economic benefit being in the EU is
Don't watch mainstream BBC because
Well
Tory mouthpiece
But I'm studying human rights at the moment and our lecturer is keeping us up to date with everything going on in Poland
That and my gf keeps me up to date since she's Polish herself
EU can't do anything but ECHR can
ECHR isn't part of the EU, it's part of the Council of Europe which every European country has signed accepting human rights
Even Russia and (I think) Turkey are on the list so you know its definitely not the EU
If Poland go full blown ban on abortion even if there was rape, there's precedent in an Irish case that the ECHR will place heavy fines on the country until the ban is lifted
After that case and another where women were blocked from leaving the country to get abortions in less strict countries and that was also found to be in breach of human rights, Ireland became one of the most liberal countries in Europe for abortions
For the UK it's Oxford and Cambridge, in Scotland it's between Edinburgh, St Andrews and Glasgow
All are very difficult to get into, Oxbridge is crazy though
I personally didn't like the culture round them, too much formality
Beautiful campuses though
In Scotland I’d say theres a couple
People like to portray St Andrews at the top but if I’m being honest all the ancient ones are equal like Glasgow or edinburgh
The only ones I’d say aren’t prestigious are modern ones like the University of the West of Scotland (the reason for the big name is that it isn’t very attractive to students if the name is University of Paisley)
It depends who you ask, but one of Glasgow, Edinburgh or St
Andrews
Andrews is the most traditional, and eschews all technical subjects, so the people who care about that would probably say it's the most prestigious
For law in Scotland, I think it's actually Strathclyde uni
Glasgow Uni is probably one of the most prestigious overall but it's supposed to be shite for law
For Scotland I would definitely say that St Andrews is top, while Glasgow and Edinburgh follow closely behind in joint second
Yeah St Andrews for me
Plus i think of it as an extension of English Unis
Yeah unfortunately in Britain there is so much inbuilt class issues with education that they don't actually look at the content or ranking it's just a wink wink nudge nudge you went to my uni you get the job
There is definitely a different set of rules for the high paying Asians compared to the rest of us
It's a real shame to be honest, I remember having some in group projects and they certainly weren't on the same level as us
I needed AAAAB to get into my course but no way those students were getting that
My professor described them as computers they needed to basically be scripted on what to do and couldn't think for themselves, no creativity or perseverance on it if they haven't been walked through it already
Unfortunately there is a funding crisis in unis in UK and this is an "easy solve" for the unis to make up the pay gap
They often also don't interact much with the wider uni community and ostracized themselves
They basically attend different unis to the rest of us
The only good thing has been an uptake in better Asian food places in the west end
St Andrews is good for things like theology etc but doesn't do nearly as wide a range of subjects as the other 2
Edinburgh and Glasgow have very rich histories and are both top notch unis and are better at some subjects
To compare world rankings as an example in the QS rankings, St Andrews is 92nd this year Glasgow 77th and Edinburgh 20th putting Edinburgh above big US unis like John Hopkins and only 3 below Yale
For law possibly but in general I think Edinburgh has a much more prestigious history and is higher in the rankings than St Andrews
St Andrews doesn't do all the STEM subjects so I always forget about it
St Andrews I think has the reputation recently because of Prince William but Edinburgh also has a shit ton of English and international students
An extension of English unis, or an extension of the English public school system
I just feel like there’s a lot of posh English folk at St Andrews (also like your username)
Yeah I have friends that went to Oxbridge and went to the dinners etc
I was horrified and how incestuous some of it was
There is obviously many who are just smart kids but there's a whole subsection where daddy is the ambassador to Nigeria and Uncle John is head of a division at Goldman's.
> I guess my own country is quite underwhelming from a tourist perspective
I don't know
I went on holiday to Slovakia and loved it - I spent about ten days just travelling around, exploring the country, visiting castles, walking, enjoying the food and the beer and wine
I thought it was a great place to visit
I've travelled quite a bit in that part of the world - I've visited Poland three times (to Krakow, Warsaw and the north coast), Hungary and Romania (Transylvania), and Ukraine - and I think of all of them Slovakia was the one I enjoyed most
Then again, I just love that central European Hapsburg vibe - the food, the landscapes etc
BiH is great to visit, it's got a mix of cultures, great food, interesting history, varied architecture and some very pretty nature
Vilnius is the G spot of Europe though, worth paying attention to
Same here, losing the "well" kinda makes it better but still sounds cunty
I noticed this when I moved to the US from Scotland
It somehow felt like everyone was being rude to me and I could quite figure out why
In the UK, some older generations would say “it’s the dog’s bollocks” meaning it’s good
What tf is possibly good about dog’s bollocks
Be fine most of the time, tbh
Tone really matters more/most in these cases
Depends on the company, I suppose, ultimately
It's kinda part of the fun but I don't think I'd want anyone calling me darling or honey anyways, that's a bit of an English thing,those two anyway, unless I was in a relationship with the person
It's all in the wording and so long as you're fairly polite here we won't mind you
Haha, that’s amazing
I didn’t know there were so many distinct dialects, although admittedly I’m picking up on many now that I live in the US
Oh honey, dont be like that
Edit: fuck me nah
Dont like that
It's very much a context thing and also depends on the person, some can definitely somehow get away with it, if I use darling it just sounds odd to come out of my mouth
Yeah they're usually used for people you know but not always, very location dependant as to the degree to which it sounds odd
I don't think there is many corrupt politicians in Scotland
Micro-corruption (bribes to police officers to waive fines, bribes to officials to speed the processing of documents, bribes to judges to decide a case) is almost non-existent
Macro-corruption (campaign donations to influence policy decisions and government contracts in favour of particular interests) is rife
It certainly isn't a problem in daily life I suppose but when every public infrastructure, health and community project seems to end up costing 3x the original budgets you start to get suspicious
Apart from Police Scotland (which is a good police force in many ways however has and still deals with problems of corruption
) most of the country is very transparent
We're more corrupt than most people here probably like to think but overall still not that corrupt
*An Eala Bhan* (The White Swan), is a poem set to music, telling of a soldier's love for his betrothed and his longing to return home to her, and peace
Sadly, real-life is invariably less romantic than poetry, for whilst the author did return safely, she married someone else
- not sure how you make hyperlinks say something else but this alestorm song is the peak of Scottish music
"Hector the Hero" always tugs at my heart
Nothing except a choir can beat the bagpipes, when it comes to conveying emotion (in my opinion)
It was composed in honour of a real soldier, Hector MacDonald, who committed suicide after slanderous accusations against them ruined his reputation and his life
Hector enlisted in the army as a lowly private, at the age of 17, and rose through the ranks to become a Major General, a rare example of pure merit carrying good soldiers into the higher ranks
I think that was the first single I ever bought
I used to know every word
TIL Gustav Holst was British
This whole time I thought he was Swedish, wtf
But I do love Jupiter, and imo, "I vow to thee my country" would be a far better national anthem than God save the Queen
I’m not sure what constitutes a ‘larger city’ but I’ll assume Edinburgh counts
So I live in Edinburgh, Scotland
It’s the capital of Scotland and home to our parliament which is opposite a royal palace and both are adjacent to a park which has an extinct volcano in the middle called Arthur’s Seat
Edinburgh is the second largest city in Scotland with Glasgow the largest, both have quite a different feel though
Edinburgh is a very historic city with a wealth of beautiful architecture
In many areas it is very affluent but like all cities, has areas of deprivation
It’s reasonably multicultural for its size and is popular with European migrants, especially from Spain and Eastern Europe
We have four universities so have a large student population
Life is good here, many people use public transport as we have a good network of buses and slowly growing tram network
Downsides include high property prices and the weather
We are definitely on the small scale in terms of being a city, but that's kind of a good thing in its own way
The climate/ weather is not even that bad imo
It doesn't rain *that* much and who wants to be hot anyway
Haha
Brilliant
And it’s true, the difference in rainfall between east and west is crazy
We may not get the higher temps they do south of the border but it’s sunny on the east coast
in fact, Dundee is the sunniest city in Scotland
Yeah, I agree
Our weather is ok
I wish we were guaranteed a better summer but we rarely have weather extremes in winter or summer
The beast from the east was something else
Finally putting enough funding in to crack efficient fusion power
It’s sad that fusion could have been possibly obtained decades ago but the funding just isn’t there
Relatively infinite, green power forever
We would never run out of fuel
The patents attributed to the continent and distributed would pay for themselves within years and pretty much advance human civilisation in every possible way
I feel like draining the entire north and Baltic Sea would have a huge impact on sea level
I can’t say I would be against a legalisation, safe production and safe consumption of all narcotics available where possible, but it’s not my *first* goal for the world
Didn’t the Russians literally annex Crimea for access to ports
For the UK, we have a short list (mostly because six of the UK's monarchs have been called George and the country isn't that old) -
Anne, George, William, Victoria, Edward and Elizabeth
For Scotland we have a considerably longer list
I've included all names where there were multiple claimants to the throne -
Kenneth, Donald, Constantine, Aed, Giric, Eochaid, Malcolm, Indulf, Dubh, Cuilen, Amlaib, Duncan, Macbeth, Lulach, Edgar, Alexander, David, William, Margaret, John, Robert, Edward, James, Mary, Charles and Anne
> Amlaib
Was he a Norse king
I've seen the modern surname MacAulay as an anglicised *Mac Amhlaibh*, which is the Gaelic cognate of *Olafson*.
It does
I agree that Black is an odd name
It may not actually have been his name - there's so little contemporary material that we know little about him
It may have been a negative nickname about his character, a reference to the colour of his hair or possibly even of his skin
He's also referred to as Dén or 'Vehement' in another source
MacBeth was actually quite a good King
Shame about the play
He and his father Indulf both have Old Norse names but weren’t Norse - both were Gaels
There’s not a great deal of information left, but his grandfather Constantine II probably married the daughter of Eadwulf II of Northumbria, who was definitely Norse
Constantine II was also an ally of Olaf Guthfrifthson, King of Dublin
The names probably come from the family connection to other Norse royalty
Henry and Richard were names used by the English Monarchy, but not the Scottish
There haven't been any Henrys or Richards since the UK was formed
Both Charles I and Charles II were King of Scotland and King of England
The thrones were in union, but the countries were separate at the time
Mary I of England (Bloody Mary) and Mary I of Scotland (Mary, Queen of Scots) ruled at the same time but were (obviously) different people
Mary II was Queen of both Scotland and of England, but again this was while the countries were separate
Thanks for that, that's interesting
Scotland's early history as a nation is definitely something I need to do more reading on
She teaches Spanish in the UK
French
French opens up half of Africa
For a lot of jobs in aid, trade, development, infrastructure and technology, international organisations, diplomacy, conflict resolution, military etc etc French is a really useful language
In Scotland it’s whether you have [chippy sauce or ketchup] on your Fish and Chips
It’s actually a *literal* divide on the East/West coasts
I'm led to believe that a good chunk of that lot are of Scottish descent from the Plantation and all that
No one over here, regardless of denomination, keeps their toaster in the cupboard, so I've no idea where they've got that weird-arse habit from
(I'm aware the colonisation pre-dates toasters of course
Technically (and legally) a cake but eaten like a biscuit
The overlapping bit of the venn diagram
even though it's got cake in the name it's not a cake or a biscuit, it's just a jaffa cake
I chop and change, occasionally coming out with some bastardised sound somewhere in between (have I accidentally invented a vowel
I reckon I favour "gone" though
Milk Second
Barry's
Aye, I'm quite hungry just now actually
I'll skip this one to avoid an international incident but your soda bread stuff is nice
Tayto
Specifically Republic Tayto rather than North Tayto
There was this guy from Glasgow complaining to Trading Standards a few years back about how a chippie charged for tomato sauce
The guy claimed it was "racial discrimination"!
The best part of the court case is they baked a massive normal-cake-sized jaffa cake to prove a point
I fucking love studying law sometimes
I had no idea there was a Bavarian wikipedia
Learning German in school we only learned Brötchen
Supper's a different meal altogether in Scotland (unless you're at the chippie, then it's another kettle of fish)
I actually took that picture from an article about that debacle since it showed both sauces
What a fucking nutter
Obviously he shouldn’t have asked for tomato sauce at all; chippy sauce is king
(I admit though that putting chips with chippy sauce in a buttered roll with a little bit of tomato sauce/ketchup on top of them as well is kind of amazing)
Oh no I really hope my accent and pronunciation has gotten worse than it used to be because I still can't speak German well to save my life and I don't want to *sound* like someone who should be able to
A light meal later on in the evening a wee bit before bed, after you've had your tea/dinner
I only found out recently that this isn't a thing elsewhere in the English speaking world
At the chippy it's just x-with chips, so a fish supper is fish and chips, sausage supper is sausage and chips etc

Tall guy, blonde hair
Aye, I know him
Some are undying enemies of a friend, for reasons that make no sense to anyone - including the people involved, but the grudge shall be held for eternity
Scotland, however, is not
Especially as a lot of it is empty, and our population is largely confined to a relatively small area
We do, we do mainly Scottish & UK stuff, some about Ireland and a lot about the US and the rest of Europe
When I was in school, we spent a whole year in history learning about the potato famine
I'm not sure if they do in England though
Not even America
It's definitely not just a Scottish thing, but I think it's probably more of a small town thing than a small country thing
More like on and off with some other topics lol
Nah, it only counts if my great-grandad said that to your great-grandad
In my 4th year of high school, I chose to study history for that year
We mostly learned about the causes and consequences of it, and then also the immigration that took place afterwards
One Scottish Gàidhlig word (dont think its used commonly though) is sùil-thòine which means eye-arse or eye-of-the-arse
And I think, personally, that eye-of-the-arse is a good enough translation for arsehole
To summarise, in gàidhlig cuttlefish are erseholes
im gonna say 500 miles (along with many other proclaimers songs) and ig lewis capaldi did pretty well with someone you loved
If I never hear 500 miles again then that's just fine by me
for scotland in particular id say anything by calvin harris, its mostly just mediocre drum&bass and remixes
Probably that dance monkey by Tones and I, That shite went on for about 4-5 months constantly on the radio
[I'm Gonna Be (500 miles)] is so clearly the right answer for us
No fucking way mate
The answer for this is clear and obvious
Mediocre song that achieved global fame to an unprecedented degree
[When I wake up
Well I know I'm gonna be
Fucking love The Proclaimers though
Persevere is a fantastic album
I have never heard of this
I thought you meant [Flat Eric]
Yes, I'm old
for sure
Of all the proclaimers songs, this is the only one I can't fucking stand
I HAVE NO IDEA HOW THE FUCK I FORGOT ABT THE PROCLAIMERS i take what i said back
It was played on forth 1 and radio one constantly probably the with Clyde 1 as well
Nah, plenty of us love the song
It is overplayed though and regarded as cheesy, definitely easy to see why some people now hate it
Edinburgh Trams - asking someone if they like them is a great way of finding out if they're from the city
Siemens were also involved in the disastrous [Edinburgh Tram Project]  By most accounts the trams are now a good thing for the city but the building of them was an absolute shambles and they only got completed due to sunk costs
Edinburgh at the start of the project had one of the best bus systems I've ever used and trams were an unnecessary disruption
My favourite part of the projects failings was when track had to be relaid because snow/cold damaged it
We don’t have ID cards here either
Closest we have is our driving licence
There is a national ID card you just need to apply for it
Yeah, I went into Sainsbury's a few days ago with my dad and the only empty shelves were the soaps and all that
Some woman even tried to buy literally every hand sanitizer they had but obviously they didn't let her do that
I'm fairly certain she was planning on selling it on Ebay or something for a higher price since it's probably gonna be relatively hard finding soap now
> Similarly, freedom
Saoirse
Seer-sha
Saorsa in Scottish Gaelic, kind of like soor-sa/soor-sha
Always interesting to see how it changed in the crossing and the millenia and more apart
I need to keep reminding myself that you guys don't tend to pronounce the final 'r' down south, really threw me comparing Celador to 'cellar door' initially
Same
"Sella daw" to them it would seem
Ah, that's interesting
That sort of rain is known as *smirr* in Scots, which almost sounds as if it could be related to the Basque word
Scots / Gàidhlig names are pretty cool for the most part
From William to Struan, most of them sound strong and cool
Sholto (dunno that I spelled it right but thats how it sounds) is horrendous
Dörte, definitely Dörte
I love old Saxon names in English
Penicillin
“We” invented a fuck ton of other useful stuff as well, but I think penicillin was probably the most important
Probably biggest one is the telephone or television, but there’s honestly so much more
Especially things we use on a daily basis
Penicillin, the MRI, refrigerators, Toaster, contact lenses, syringes, steam engines, etc
Top ones are probably the steam engine, penicillin, the telephone, TV, bikes, football (fuck off England we invented it) but I would still have to go for Irn Bru
Depends if talking about Scotland telephone maybe
Tons of other things too, if talking about the UK & NI tons literally tons
I wouldn't know where to begin
The Steam Engine that fuelled the Industrial Revolution was actually invented by James Watt
he did improve upon earlier designs made by an Englishman I'll give you that
And golf
Steam engine was English according to Wikipedia
[No it isn’t ]
Like everything in the UK we half arsed it and called it job done lol
I was just thinking that
James Watt mate
Same with passing in Football and Andy Murray always trying to claim our shit
He discovered insulin, not penicillin
Those are two very different things
When Covids over go to the Hampden museum, all the evidence is there
Look up newspapers of when Andy Murray wins and loses, you'll see a pattern
Look at this cunt
Imagine actually posting in r/badunitedkingdom
Imagine projecting your own sensitivity onto others because you can’t handle the fact that your precious United Kingdom will be dead within the decade
Imagine being so far up Boris Johnson’s arse that you came all over your room when he said there is no border between England and Scotland
State of you ya cunt go take a well hard look at yourself you arse licking cleg
Yeah complaining is unique only in Scotland, no one else in the UK complains about anything its our unique quirk, everyone else is sunshine and posies
Mate a think you’ve spelt your name wrong it says disillusioned Brit surely you mean delusional brit
Yes but aren't schuko plugs less safe from the electrical aspect in that they're not fused and not always grounded
And also I guess the fact that they don't have switches on the socket like we do is probably another thing
We didn’t have a real name for the people who were part of Siol nan Gaidheal
We just called them arseholes
Same for the Union of British Fascists
They were also deemed “arseholes
In the UK such a man might be called Colonel Blimp
I'm a native English speaker who works in an 'International English' environment
There are quite a few words, expressions and idioms that I'd use in my own English that I cannot use in that environment, because they are not universally understood in international English
So I'm very conscious about when I'm using Scottish English (as vehicle of national culture) and when I'm using International English (as a means of global communication)
Fifa surely
Colin McRae Rally/DiRT series is pretty ace tbh, even if I still find the original PS1 titles as my favourite
Gotta love the cheat code to make the cars into hovercars
Doing that to the Audi Quattro was always a terrifying challenge ahehe
I'd like to say thanks to the countries of the EU that made the last 40 years amazing
Thanks to the Netherlands for providing us with plenty of plants
Ireland: Thank you for the good craic and for being brave enough to go your own way a little over a century before we started venturing in that direction
Northern Ireland: Thank you for being the only country that really understands our sense of humour
England: Thank you for all the money you give us to prop up the economy
Norway: Thank you for giving us the Northern Isles as a wedding present
Denmark: Thank you for not invading us over all that oil you sort of claim
I would like to thank England for absolutley fuck all
> Mate, us people in my city up north never wanted any of this shite
[The majority of the north of England did, though
Popular local soft drink
It has to be Irn Bru
I believe we’re one of very few countries in the world where a local drink is more popular than Coca Cola
IRN-BRU , it is one it the only soft drinks in the world that outsells coca cola in a country
It's my favourite drink and could not live without it
I haven’t seen those for ages
They’re great
I wish it was the same in the UK, but the past is constantly romanticised
I’m half German and growing up that’s been shit on, constantly
Agreed
The UK is going through a "culture war" between the people who want to acknowledge that the British empire wasn't great for a lot of the world, and those who want to whitewash history and pretend the bad stuff never happened
It's not healthy, and it's worrying that even our government is trying to only allow a rose tinted version of history to be acceptable
In the UK the view of the rural area varys a lot depending on where the rural area is
I grew up in the South West, a place called north devon
Very rural, about 70% farmland/fields
So naturally when you meet someone not from the area and you say "Im from north devon" they instantly assume youre a farmer
Go onto google and search up "devonshire accent" or "westcountry yap" thats what everyone thinks we sound like but most of us dont, its mostly just the actual farmers that grow up in isolated farm houses that sound like that, which is a pretty small part of the population here
Depends on where they are
Rural Highlanders are called Teuchters, their seen as very SNP, Gaelic speaking, Potato eating crofters who can’t stop saying the words Michty Me and playing Shinty
Rural Aberdonians shag sheep
Rural people in Perth and Kinross are seen as posh tories
Fifers are seen as one eyed 12 toed mutants no matter rural or urban
Edit: Borders are Tories, Ayrshire is full of bigots and neds, East Lothian is full of Farmer wanks, Midlothian is full of Wanks, West Lothian is full of top shaggers except Linlithgow who are tories
Only stereotype being people tend to think they are richer and more right wing, some people would refer to them as sheep shaggers because they are from the country
But not much difference haha
What the hell is going on there on this day
I stayed just outside Madrid during my gap year and I can't even imagine this
I spent the whole time melting and gulping down cafe con hielo even when it was "cool" outside
I hope you make the most of it
207 people killed in a coal mining explosion in Blantyre in the late 19th century
As for Beirut, it's heartbreaking - Beirut has not had a happy history
Probably the Lockerbie bombing where Pan Am flight 103 was brought down by a terrorist bomb over Scotland in 1988 killing 270 people, to this day the second worst terrorist attack in European history
Explosion in Clarkston on October 21st 1971
A buildup of gas from a leaky mains destroyed several shops and a car park, killing 21 people, mostly shop workers, customers and the passengers of a passing bus
England - despite the rivalry we have always had, the jokes are just for fun and no harm is meant
Youre our sister nation and we are more alike than we would like to believe
You have the best humour, the greatest stoicism and the most humbling generosity of any other people I've known
Wales - we love you, you glorious sheepshagging rogues
You remind us of ourselves
Never met an unfriendly Welshman and doubt that will ever change
France - we love to joke about you, but behind your reputable arrogance there is a true honesty and sincerity that we can truly appreciate
Germany - The friendliest and most welcoming people I've ever met (but not in Berlin), I've always made German friends on holiday
The most approachable and easy going people around in my experience
England: err
Thanks for forcing the Irish to learn English so they gave the world James Joyce
You’ve had some great writers yourselves
Well in
Also I liked playing rugby before I got so beaten up I couldn’t play anymore
I really liked visiting Bristol and Ludlow
I think we’re cool with the rest of Europe
Love youse all
England; I love it when you play football at major tournaments
Isn't the rivalry between Serbia and Croatia just as bad as Croatia-Bosnia or am I imagining that
Yep, and it definitely does the job
No I do not
Is that long enough for the automod
* The back of beyond
* Arse end of nowhere
* Timbuktoo
* Outer Mongolia
* Utter Hebrides (a pun on the Outer Hebrides archipelago)
* *MAMBA* (miles and miles of bugger all)
In English we say “We had to by China” if a long diversion is required
Also "dove ha perso le scarpe il signore" (Where the Lord lost his shoes)
England gets a lot of shit for being full of bigots but truth be told we're a lot less tolerent than a lot of people want to pretend
Well tbf the SNP currently hold 47 out of 59 Scottish seats in Westminster (something like 79% or 80%) when the country had been dyed-in-the-wool Labour for close to 100 years before that
Gaining one seat is nowhere near the level of gains that the SNP have made in Scotland
Jeez we’re even bigoted towards each other
There is mate
They're called Unionists
Yeah in Scotland people from Aberdeen often get called sheep shaggers
Especially the football team
Why do American cities have so few medieval castles and churches
I just can't figure it out
>Here in Dublin in the 1960s some very nice buildings were knocked down and replaced with buildings that could only be described as eyesores and completely out of character with the buildings around them
The same thing happened in Glasgow
Beautiful tenement flats where bulldozed and replaced with these ugly cheep high rises that are to this day seen as a symbol of poverty
It’s horrible driving through the city, seeing all the beautiful Georgian architecture (which admittedly would look better if the sun ever bothered to show up), only to be blindsided by the towering-yet-pathetic image of these ugly high rises
Very common with English - so many countries have variants
The obvious being the USA, but there's also very strong localisation in place like India, Barbados and other (former) commonwealth countries
It doesn't bother me that a visitor uses their version of English, especially as they may not be away that certain words aren't understood in our version of English
We even see it within the UK - for example, here in Scotland, "outwith" is used regularly, but is unheard of in much of England (although it should be obvious in context)
I would expect that if someone chooses to live in the UK that they start using UK spellings eventually
But it's not a big deal
English is such a mess of a language and is customised by so many countries and even regions within countries that it would be a bit silly to get upset over it
It depends entirely on how it's done
If it's done to avoid misunderstandings and ease communications, that's great
If it's done to mock us, it'll be received badly
That'd be *really* weird if that were to happen
Obviously if they've lived here for loads of years and just start doing it naturally then it's no bother, but if they come here and actively try then they're just gonna make themselves look stupid and weird
It depends who it is, I love Australian slang and the Caribbean dialects basically every English adaptation is cool with me
Unless it’s Americans (specifically Californians)
I just find a lot of what they say really cringe
Messages = Groceries is the only familiar one to me
> Their habit of dropping ‘and’ after the word ‘go’ is annoying too
Americans always ‘Go do’, ‘Go make’, ‘Go visit’ etc
It always sounds really illiterate (‘me go visit man’)
This, and saying things like "Last week I wrote her" instead of "Last week I wrote *to* her"
And don't even get me started on what they've done to adverbs
Weren't flipflops 'thongs'?
I've only heard it pronounced that way, remember cause it sounds like the ladies garment, not the kitchen utensil
France
They eat frogs
And Germany oh Germany, 3 words: failed conquest, TWICE
I guess this is why on average you Portuguese have better with English - since you only have subtitles in Portuguese with the original English voice
I've got to be completely fair and say that England is constantly shat on so it's somewhat fair for them to chuck it back in some way
On the other hand, getting out of bed in winter must be difficult for you guys - sunrise must be at like 9 am
>Why the rest of the UK seem to hate us but we like them
What
That's just not true, we don't. And it doesn't help that the media likes to portray it that way
But it was invented in Scotland and we're unlikely to win even in 100 years haha
> You say you don't hate England but in all honesty it feels like you do, some of the time
I feel a lot of this is Scottish/Welsh/NI people criticising the UK govt or institutions, and English people taking it as an attack on them
Hoover is what pretty much everyone I know calls a vacuum cleaner
Get the Hoovering done etc
Nutella in the uk is just the word we use for any kind of chocolaty spread
Doesn’t matter what brand actually made it
It’s always just referred to as Nutella
"Wheres the castle
They asked in Edinburgh city centre, in full view of the castle
I think the tourists cracking open a six pack at the summit of Ben Nevis and loudly asking if the small, emergency shelter at the summit was a bar
No it is not
No one is going to go up our tallest mountain to sell you lot beer before you decide to drunkenly nosedive off a precipice
That is not what is going to happen
I can understand maybe a tiny thing to celebrate the summit, but getting hammered up there just seemed so enormously stupid
I live in Edinburgh so its amplified a bit
I've been on arthur seat (the main hill in Central Edinburgh) and people have asked me, where is Arthur Seat
Right up there ya donut
Ask a bus driver if they go to a specific hotel
Ask if they can pay in euros
Ask why the castle is so far away from the railway station
And best of all, asking people what clan they are part of and how they are looking for clan whatever that they grandfathers aunties dog was allegedly part of in 1339
I've told it before here but the short version is Chinese tourist threatens me (bouncer) with knife, gets knocked out, spends several days in hospital, may or may not have lost sight in one eye and got arrested
&#x200B;
For something I haven't said here before I've seen Chinese tourists drive on the wrong side of the road before
In Edinburgh and American said how convenient it was that they built the (1000+year old castle) next to the train station
Wait for a solid 10 minutes at a cross road waiting for the red light to go green even though there is not a car in sight
Did it break both arms, or just one
I believe we that's just the international cunt
Had some Americans say the same thing to me a couple of times as well
How they don't see how amazingly insulting that is to say is beyond me
Apparently there is a lot of interchange in Spanish, Italian, and Potruguese and it's possible to have conversations if you keep to very basic words
But due to French having different noises they get left out
I thoight the general rule in museums was no flash, anyway
Oh god, reminded me of how they swarm onto the main road of this little village, fucking up traffic and oblivious to the rather generously large pavements they could use and not obstruct the roads
I'd almost wish they would be patient enough to wait a bit in the station, since they end up complaining about lack of things to do in a place they've just doubled the population of on arrival
"Yeah you know that massive fucking hill with a castle on it visible for miles and miles, its there"
Also love 'have a bad day'. Legitimately made me laugh :)
It's not far at all
But if you don't know how to get there it can be confusing
Also Americans don't really walk anywhere
Either that guy was very fucking stupid or he knew where he was and what he was doing
You don't scream Heil Hitler in St Pauli and not get punched in the face there
Did you enjoy your trip
I think I know the one you mean, Crammond right
People outside of glasgow get called teuchters(chook-ters)
\*Teuchterland\* - a \*teuchter\* is a countryside dweller
It's not a capital city affectation, instead you're more likely to encounter the attitude from our biggest city, Glasgow, where anything not-Glasgow is seen as "teuchter" (including Scotland's 6 other cities)
Depends where you live
Where I live
unless your job pays you to jump about, you don't, and not abroad
Given the capital of Scotland is a nice 4hrs drive/6hrs train away, it's just not really common to jump abroad (or even to England) on the regular
Border regions are likely different cases from places on the periphery like where I live, but it varies greatly
Certainly would be wrong to think every European is constantly border hopping, I'd be surprised if a majority does it very frequently
But then, that might just be the perspective from my location and economic class
Edit: this is all seperate from holidays, which are often international, though holidays with the same country are not uncommon
Visited a friend working there
Glad she allowed me to stay at her flat, cause just paying for a small amount of food and some trains made that country to most expensive trip I've had
Felt like eveything was x3-x5 more expensive for no discernible reason
How is travel different in America
It’s a 43 hour drive, it’s like driving from Paris to Moscow
Yeah schools are a bit different for it but as an individual you could in theory just get up one day and drive around Europe just cause you want to
Yah
For example, the school trip for my small highschool in the Scottish Highlands was to London, with a few other things in England (believe Alton Parks was part of it, wherever they are in southern(?) England)
Location and budget likely matters (although saying that, that school trip was way too expensive, cost about twice the cost for me to go on it than my whole families trip to Morocco, France or Spain)
My favourite is Spanglish
Sounds like a bouncing fish
*chorey* meaning to steal, and *gadgie* meaning young man both come from Romany, which is surprising, as Romany people have not otherwise had a big cultural impact on Scotland
> "Vigéc" is a very old-fashioned word for travelling salesmen
It comes from German "Wie geht’s Ihnen
" (How are you
), because that is how Austrian travelling salesmen introduced themselves back in the 19th century
This has made my day
If you are a 17th century Jew fleeing religious persecution, where are you going to go: Catholic Brussels, or Protestant-Secular Amsterdam
We also use dram in Scots (for whisky, not snaps)
If you define Scots as a language, it's that
If not, probably Scots Gaelic
Depends
If we are talking native languages to the country, Scots (if it’s counted as one) is easily the biggest
If not Gaelic is
If we are talking all languages, either Polish or Urdu for immigrants
If we are talking L2, then we usually do French in schools and also Spanish but we are a fairly monolingual country (if you don’t count Scots as a language)
Most people don’t know how to use basic computer programs but have Admin and IT as a class for the first two years of high school so normally pick up some basic ability
I've noticed that with some graduates who have recently started at my work, in their early to mid-20s.
I do IT support, and I think a lot of the younger generation now are geared towards point and click wizards for doing everything on tablets, so there's definitely diminished basic IT skills when it comes to a desktop operating system for a lot of them
> I found in secondary school people lacked basic skills for computers and people needed to be taught basics like MS word
Creating and organising folders
Can attest to this, I work IT Support and we have uni graduates in their early to mid 20's who have no idea how to connect a Windows laptop to their home WiFi, despite having a printed reference guide in front of them with images showing exactly how to do it
I think a lot of the younger generation, outside those like yourself with an active interest in computers, who are used to mobile OS' with very simplified GUIs and they don't know how to do a lot of things that are considered the basics on a proper OS
I’m disappointed because at the time of posting this comment, this thread was sitting on 423 comments
Rather popular
But a lot of us like cocaine or ketamine
(Not me though, I’m not a junkie I swear
The one that gets me is Hamish, because Hamish is literally a gaelicisation of James in the vocative case
I have also seen "Itzan" - which looks more Basque to me, but might also just be a version of Ethan
Shawn is worse to me
I will instinctively spell it Sean unless corrected
‘Chrzaszcz’ (I don’t have the correct ‘a’ on my keyboard :( )remains my favourite polish word
It looks like nonsense, but when you learn the sounds and break it down it makes sense suddenly why it’s pronounced that way
There are often a few specific mistakes like pluralising things that shouldn't be pluralised but other than these few specific things it's really very good
I probably make more mistakes by just typing fast
I never really find myself reading posts here and thinking to myself "yep, that's a non native english speaker", so I'd say it's at a fairly high level
Wish I had the balls to do something like at least for some period of time but I'm.settling down with my partner so I think the time has passed
Besides Scotlands no bad
But if did it would be maybe Canada or Germany
I'm still gutted
Ours is Rèile which due to us being lazy, literally just translates to rail
There is very little "unspoiled" areas in Scotland - even the remote wilderness areas were deforested for sheep grazing or deer stalking
Areas like the Cairngorm plateau and the Knoydart peninsula are almost empty though, and you could travel for miles without seeing another person
[According to Atlas Obscura] the most remote place in Britain is only 5
7 miles from a road
I imagine it is closer to other evidence of human habitation, like trails
But the north of Scotland has been inhabited for a good 10,000 years, so there is sure to be evidence of human activity around wherever you go
I'm sure someone could write a script using the OpenStreetMap API to find the point in a country furthest from all roads, could be interesting
Completely untouched pure wilderness
Not really, the highlands of Scotland are mostly an artificial habitat created by bronze age tree felling and modern sheep farming
But it's still pretty wild and you can go up there and not see another person for days if you're remote enough
You might not see a lot of people, but there’s a shit ton of sheep
The southern uplands are reasonably untouched tbh
They're pretty empty, but they're not untouched
Almost all the open moorland is used for sheep, and most of the forest there is planted timber forest
Unfortunately climate change is making the midges worse
> well it's difficult to translate because there's no English word for it, but "Finland is [like someone who lives in and off the forest]"
"Woodsman" can be used in English in this context for a skilled person, or "Forrester", if it's a profession
Ah, fair enough
Languages can be interesting in that way
Head of State I doubt any fucker would care especially given they're A) parasites with no actual power and B) German already
Head of Government however I could see being an issue with people
Regardless of which government Im talking about
I think if the Scottish first minister was foreign (rUK included), nobody would really give a fuck, as long as they live here they’d be fine
If they had an English accent it might be a problem to some, but not really a big deal
Boris Johnson was born in America and I actually only found out a couple of months ago, so not that controversial
I only ever hear about it with other points being made against him but I don't think the fact itself is worrying that many people, it's just when it's grouped up with him being not that great
I don't know about all of that, but it still fits in with the question
None of them, journalism is dead as is the politics it comments on
I think we'd have to say France
Auld alliance and hundred of years of mutual hate of the bloody Sassanachs
Sad Scotland noises
Scotland hates everybody, even Scotland
Sorry pals x
Until we went bankrupt trying trying to build a Panama cannel, funded by selling woollen jumpers to the natives
And for some reason only England bailed us out
And didn't attack us
The Auld Alliance is 3 times older than the USA
> You can take the piss out of someone and it shows how much you like them
The better you know someone, the more you can take the piss out of them
This is also true of Scotland, I think
I don't think that there's been a breakdown on air in Scotland from a politician but I will say that our First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has been looking distressed at times due to the current Pandemic, announcing the Daily Updates she has admitted at times she has been crying due to the fact that announcing the amount of people who have died
She has also had to deal with The Scottish Labour Party trying to stop The Daily Updates on Television because they claim that they are (I still can't believe that they had the gall to do this) "Political Broadcasts" which is baffling because at no point in them has Nicola Sturgeon clearly promoted her party through them, The SNP
At one point in the summer they actually got them stopped on BBC Scotland which annoyed her to say the least as for some people in Scotland the Daily Updates where their way of keeping up to date with the changes in circumstances to the current Pandemic
A statue in Glasgow had a traffic cone put on its head by someone drunk and every time it gets removed someone else puts it back
When the government said they where going to remove the statue a petition was made to keep it
It is a statue of the duke of wellington
D I S G U S T A N G (I still hear people saying it in the street on nights out and it still cracks me up
"Am gonny sing Cher Lloyd by Cher Lloyd" comes from the same video)
Also putting a traffic cone (and other seasonal accessories) on the statue in front of the GOMA in Glasgow so much so few can remember the name of the statue other than the Traffic Cone Statue
If anyone's curious it's the Duke of Wellington
Whenever the police take it down, a Weegie will risk it to put another up so for the majority of the time the police don't do anything anymore
Another runner up is whenever a tourist from South of the border is visiting and you're either showing them around or telling them about the area, sometimes throw in a wee fact about the elusive haggis animal
It isn't true and most people get that you're teasing them, but sometimes you'll get Mr and Mrs Gullible you can have a field day with
The British Parliament
Yer da sells Avon
Boris Johnson
Any quote from still game really
Too right and sometimes it evolves
Oh fuck yeah I didn't even think to say that, I went with the fact we all use and recognise patter from still game or chewing the fat
I lived together with two french dudes during my Erasmus Semester
One from the north and one from the south
There were heated discussions
Also - "TRAMPOLINE
My entire school independently decided that we’d get my Syrian mate with that when he moved here
No one planed it
I just remember telling him about haggis and him already knowing about it
The fact we're still part of the UK
u/forkingandcountryx your comment was so brave and heroic
Was there a point in that or was it an invite for a jab at how many Westminster MPs have been a bit fond of kids
Our parliament isn't run entirely by people who weren't voted for by even a slim minority of the population of the country at least which the British government is
Sadly our government does have to however it is frequently protested by members being sworn in, from different parties, not just the SNP
Only reason they have to do it up here as well is because we're still joined at the hip to the UK gov
Because in Scotland we don't recognise Parliamentary Supremacy which allows Westminster to have theoretically complete power over the UK, acting with the full power of the monarch
PS isn't found anywhere in Scots Law, we even have case law saying PS has never and never will be recognised in Scotland, and its not like its even law in England
Its just a tradition made before the Union that the English kept
Instead in Scotland we have legally binding Popular Supremacy
The monarch is our sovereign but is not our political leader, it is instead the people who are supreme
Kings and Queens of Scots never had complete dominance like the Kings of England, they instead were a High Chief that had to find the respect of "lower" Chiefs if they wanted them to do something, and this relationship transferred when the Scottish Parliament was formed
This does tend to complicate things in the Union, and its a question no Judge in their right mind will ever want to figure out the answer
In England, the UK Parliament is supreme over all power with no authority that can question it without its permission
In Scotland, Parliamentary Supremacy does not legally exist, and the people are supreme over the country and as they directly elect the modern Scottish Parliament, Scots Law technically says the Scottish Parliament is supreme over all power and only the Scottish people can question it
Apologies if my wording isn't great, what I'm trying to say is; the British government is mostly comprised of seats/members whose party was not voted for in Scotland by a country mile
Long&short: we're run by Tories, Tories are vastly unpopular up here and no matter what way we vote our votes are essentially null and void Vs England
Take the last GE or Brexit as examples
45% referendum support was 6 years ago and a lot has changed since then
Lib Dems are Tory turncoats who happily accept Tories that have crossed the floor and Scottish Labour is a mere shadow of what British Labour are (and with JC going from BL I don't see that getting better, nevermind SL) so they will likely never see a return to the forefront in Scotland, at least not for British Government
For the reasons I mentioned above I don't consider Scottish Labour to be the same as British Labour so I couldn't say that the majority voted for British parties, Scottish Greens included as they're separate from English Greens
I'll be very interested to see the results here next year, hopefully we can see more in terms of IndyRef2 before then though
Not really, there's plenty of people who dislike the SNP but want independence, frankly the SNP are shit but I'll vote for them if it's a step on the road to independence, others don't quite think the same
There is more support for independence now than there was 6 years ago and the British gov/Tories can't/don't want to see that
SNP vote =/= lack of indy support
Also hoping you're Scottish because an Englishman/Welshman/Irishman (all walk into a bar) should have no say in this
I get your point and I'm not trying to exclude you for that, I'm saying you should be excluded if you don't live here or are not from here
>Excluded from what
Nobody is stopping you from saying facts but I'm saying you shouldn't have a voice with any weight in this debate
>I don't see the point in any of it
Then don't take part
Nobody asked you to, your ancestry is of no relevance and the breakup of an old af imperialist nonsense "union" is a step forward if the nation states that are a part of it are being held back by said union
Do you live in Scotland
Or are you from here
Then why should you have a voice in *Scottish* independence
I follow the international geopolitics, and keep an eye on big events
I don't really follow the internal politics of other countries that closely, although I keep more of an eye on Germany because I used to live there
Yes I follow European politics quite closely, my interest peaks around election season in each respective country but I think I could tell you at least a bit about most European countries politics but more about,
UK, Spain, Portugal, Poland, Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, Greece than the others
> I actually used to care about the US politics way more than my country's.
I find this is relatively common
In Uni, I knew plenty of people who followed American politics so closely that they forgot who their own MP here in the UK was
I find it a bit sad
People will be outraged at something an American Congressman said on the other side of the Atlantic, yet they know absolutely nothing about Ireland's politics even though they are our direct neighbours and used to be a part of the UK
Reddit, as a mostly English speaking website, probably attracts the type of people who follow American domestic politics

We've a lot of abandoned castles throughout the country, including *Slains Castle*, supposedly the inspiration for Bram Stoker
Personally, though, trying to walk back from Ibrox to the city centre after Aberdeen have beaten rangers, and the natives aren't happy is the place that's shit me up a few times
When I went to Mary Kings close in Edinburgh (when I was like 7) I thought it was the scariest place I’d ever been
That's a good shout, actually
I've not been myself, but I've heard it's put the willies up a few folk
Right now, my scariest place is Hampden, having just watched Aberdeen make an arse of it in yet another semi-final
Nice of Aberdeen to do the yearly rollover for us, was worried yous were gonny put in a shift after last week
But tbh Torry and Tillydrone at night is probably one of the sketchiest places to be in Scotland
We limited our rollover to a 20 minute period in the first half
As ever, though, any hint of a rollover to a team like celtic - even in their current, stuttering form - only ever ends one way
Torry's improved massively these days; the influx of ambitious young Polish immigrants has lifted the area (in contrast to the common stereotype of immigration), but Tilly's still rough as fuck
>We limited our rollover to a 20 minute period in the first half
We obliged by limiting our creative attacking play to a 20 minute window as well, sporting integrity at its finest
Yeah tbf I've worked in Torry and it wasn't *that* bad during the day, there was the odd scrap outside our shop but nothing mental, still wouldn't fancy wandering alone at night haha
My ex gf was from Tilly, we used to visit her family there on occasion
what a shithole haha, could never get away quick enough
The thing is, though, unless you're looking for trouble, there's generally no reason to visit Tilly
It's not even on the way to anywhere, as it's tucked away inside the bend in the river
It had a bad reputation because the local "adventurous types" would prey on the easy pickings from the students at Hillhead
Us Scots are the masters of it
Regarding teenage drinking, drunk experiences and parties well before the legal drinking age, very common, although apparently it's dropped in the past decade
Scotland has a pretty severe problem with alcohol  (you may have heard about our introduction of minimum unit pricing last year; first country in the world to do so apparently
kind of a dubious honour
) so punishments for selling to underagers are severe
Back when I was working McJobs 10 years ago, you, the pleb behind the counter could get both fined AND a prison sentence, up to £5000 and five years if I remember correctly
So yeah, *most* people in shops are pretty strict seeing as their own arse is on the line but not everyone
Also kids will always have older friends, brothers, sisters, cousins and so on so if they want booze they can usually get it
It’s apart of our identity as a people
Hmm I wonder why
We definitely can't. Our laws on alcohol are different from the rest of the UK and are significantly more severe as a result of our nation's issues with alcohol
We still have 10am to 10pm hours for shops
We were the first country in the world to introduce minimum unit pricing
Any poor sod that sells to an underager or to someone they have reason to believe is buying on behalf of an underager can face *both* a £5000 fine and a five year prison sentence
Those figures may have changed since I last worked in shops but if they have they'll have gone up not down
Ouch man
u/dani3l_554 has a good writeup on the UK as a whole
In Scotland, we have 3 left-leaning parties: the SNP, Greens and Labour
One centre party, the Lib Dems, and one right-wing party, the Conservatives
Despite having a proportional system we only have 5 parties, mainly because 3 of them (Labour, Lib, Conservatives) answer to their UK counterparts so can't really split up
Of course many people vote solely on their constitutional preferences, so even centre-right people who want independence will vote SNP
There's no real centre-right parties, but I can't imagine there will be unless we become independent
In our system we have a system called the additional member system (AMS, sometimes also called Mixed Member Proportional) which works as a balance between PR and FPTP
We tend to have more representative elections
Our current parliament is
SNP Centre-Left - 63
Conservatives, Liberal-Conservative, Centre - 31
Labour, Left wing - 24
Green, Left Wing - 6
Liberal Democrats, Centre - 5
Whole parliament is 129 MP's, although apart from once we haven't had a majority party elected as the system is designed to prevent majorities
Great comment, I just wanna add a little about the SNP cause I think saying “they tend to do well in Scotland” doesn’t quite make clear how dominant they are
The SNP have been in power in Scotland for 15 years now (they’ve only lost one national election) and they are predicted to win next years by a pretty substantial margin
They’ve also done better than every other party in UK elections for the last few elections (I’m not sure about the elections before 2010), and actually won almost every seat in 2015
It’s honestly hard to imagine any other party coming close to beating them atm
>  I don't understand how the Brits and Americans can stand it
For the UK, it's mostly because lots of people are simply not invested in politics at all
There's no big public rallying to change the system, people just sort of shrug and go "oh well".
> the Liberal Democrats are the 3rd largest but have no chance of winning
Not in term of representation in Parliament or party membership, they're not
Yeah mainly because the other parties just follow whatever the English counterpart says which leads to a lot of u-turns
Makes them seem extremely weak compared to SNP
Hey now, Canada uses it too
That’s very very simplistic tho
It’s a bit more complicated when you get into it
Yeah that’s exactly it tho
You’re an outsider comparing the UKs political parties alignments to your countries
News flash, different nations have different views
In the UK Labour and Tory are left and right
I have a subscription to The Guardian and I also financially support The National
I don't agree with every aspect of their editorial stances, but I am glad they exist in a UK/Scottish media market otherwise dominated by right-wing pro-Brexit Tories and British nationalists
The Coronavirus has done some serious damage to the English established church, because the tourist revenue has dried up
>The school had relied upon income from York Minster, however the Minster's budget for 2020 had been based on expected tourist income in the coming year
When the COVID-19 pandemic put paid to this the Minster was unable to continue assisting the school
[16] Therefore the school had to announce that it would be closing for good at the end of the Summer Term 2020
This school, although technically founded in 1903, supposedly traces its heritage back to the 7th century
It's quite sad to see it close down
In your language, is there an equivalent phrase for "fair enough
In English, this is such a useful and commonly used phrase to indicate when you accept something that someone has just said or done
You don't necessarily agree with what they have said or done (depending on the context), but you accept it - it doesn't massively bother you
Now, the spelling may be off (its been a while) but it's 'ceart gu leor' in Gaelic, which I take as correct'
/right (for 'ceart') enough ('gu leor')
It also means 'alright', but I've heard it used in the same vein as 'fair enough', so eh
>I'm not sure if I fully agree with you definition of "fair enough".
Fair enough
I thought something with "vale" would be the closest, since it's more like "okay". At least in the way that I would use it, though Spanish definitely has much more colourful and effective ways of getting points across haha
Unos amigos españoles me han dicho que no existe ninguna traducción literal

I wouldn't even have existed at any point, my grandmother would have likely died in childbirth so my mother wouldn't have survived either
Even if she did we both would have definitely died when she gave birth to me, so yes thank you very much modern medicine and c-sections
Probably a farmer, or murdered/abandoned by my parents for being too annoying
Or starved to death, or in an asylum (I loved lighting fires as a kid) or a murderer
Luckily I was born completely healthy and had no life threatening problems as a child
I've traced my family tree back to the 1750s. My ancestors around 1819 would have been weavers or slaters

He actually did hang out in Hell for a bit
>the Harrowing of Hell (Latin: Descensus Christi ad Inferos, "the descent of Christ into Hell") is the triumphant descent of Christ into Hell (or Hades) between the time of his Crucifixion and his Resurrection when he brought salvation to all of the righteous who had died since the beginning of the world
[1] After his death, Jesus descended into the realm of the dead
I recently learned that the iconic Carol of the Bells is Ukrainian too
They make some fantastic carols there
There’s a common rumour that Scottish people eat deep fried mars bars
I’m pretty sure it started out as just a fun little joke about how unhealthily we tend to eat, but it’s actually taken route as a somewhat commonly believed myth
The thing is, a lot of English tourists go out of their way to hunt for these famous mars bars, so a lot of cafes in the really touristy parts of the country actually decided to sell them
So then these tourist return home now fully believing that deep fried mars bars are a staple Scottish snack because they saw them on the menu at a cafe, and proceed to spread the rumour further
Yeah, something similar but with whiskey
Working in a grocery store and continually asked whats the best whiskey and
err, I don't drink it personally man
Don't like the stuff
>That we're Scotland
There's plenty of similar stories related to Scotland being part of Ireland too
There's a TV trope in the US about mixing up Scotland and Ireland which definitely doesnt help
They are quite good though, especially with ice cream
Grew up in a seaside town in south west england that relied on tourism, a LOT of chippies
Almost all of them sold deep fried mars bars
Tbf they taste really good (also taste like diabetes ngl)
But I never understood why it was associated with scotland when it seems like they do it because the english wanted them when they go
Id say a more scottish thing is definitely IRNBRU  my gran was scottish and for the most part favourite alcohoic drink was IRNBRU and vodka (she loved a good ol' baileys on the rocks before she passed)

Driver: 'Yes - Scotland, very nice, Dublin, Guinness
Me: 'No, that's Ireland
I'm from Scotland
Different country
Driver: 'Is same thing
In my taxi I have many Irish peoples
The stereotype that Scottish people are almost universally addicted to Irn bru is probably more common, but I wouldn’t put it on this post because it’s more or less true
Thats a very valid point

So the club 'Nachtisch' that I used to go to in Bonn, would be called dessert in English

Hahaha I spent most of my time in irish bars tbh, always a great time  ''The dubliner" or "James Joyce" took up most of my time, every Thursday there was a beer pong tournament at the Dubliner, the Germans normally crushed me tbh but it was good craic

Behold a Library, Sports Hall, Cafe and Catholic Church
All in one building
It’s had a bit of a glow up recently but back when I used to cut about there it was fucking ugly
[Cumbernauld] could also take the cake but
There is a wee chapel but it’s too small so it’s used for children’s liturgy while the sports hall is used for mass
I actually had a bit of a weird one in this regard
So state schools in Scotland teach religious studies, ie learning about a specific religions traditions, beliefs, and in some cases history
Throughout my school career I learned about Islam, Sikhism, Islam, Judaism, Islam, and Buddhism (I think a lot of teachers want to teach Islam because they wanna teach people from a young age that “no actually, Muslims are not all bloodthirsty savage terrorists”)
This is where it gets a little iffy
The headteacher  of my primary school for the first few years was an extremely religious woman
She had the local whatever-the-guy-who-stands-at-the-front-of-a-Protestant-church-and-talks-about-Jesus-is-called come in and give talks on being a good Christian every week
When we did music it we would have to sing hymns or, like, fun Christian songs about god, and we went to the local church at pretty much every available opportunity, sometimes even for a sermon
The Anyway, she moved to a different school, then years later I found out that whole thing was arguably illegal
TLDR: you’re supposed to just get a loose summary of a bunch of different religions, but due to racists most of that ended up having to be about Islam, and also my teacher tried to indoctrinate me
Yes although the one true religion isn't taught, it's an outrage if you ask me
We have RMPS/RME which is religious moral philosophical studies and religious moral education respectfully but that’s about learning about religion, not teaching it
However in my primary school they really did try make us Christian despite being a secular public school
We were made to pray, sing hymns, go to church on Easter etc and when we were taught about other religions they used a them and us language, saying ‘them’ to describe any other religion and ‘us’ to describe Christianity which was pretty gross
In my school we are taught RMPS (religious, moral and philosophical studies) so we can broaden our knowledge on different religions and such
Currently we are learning about Judaism, and we were leaning about Hinduism last year
I think it's really great that we're taught this, as before this I had no idea about all these other religions
Our school's population (idk what other word to use) is mainly Christian or Athiest, so it's brilliant to inform others about other things that they might not know about
Same
There's an elective I think, but my school didn't run it (too wee for that sort of spread pf subjects), but there was some core Religious Education that did as you said
Teach you about various religions, particularly important if you aren't in a city I expect, means even if you haven't met anyone of such faiths yet, you will know about them, and hopefully decrease the 'unfamiliar as strange and frightening' reaction that fuels so many poor interactions
Sets you up for better later on, essentially
We didn't really have prayers or the hymns in mine
Did, towards Christmas, go down to the local churches (alternating between the Catholic church and the Protestant Kirk every year) around Christmas for that, but it was opt out and I think mostly just a way to have people experience and see both of the major faiths in the area, so just an extension of RE familiarising you with other faiths in my view
But aside from that, it was pretty much just the basics of each religion and some of their holy days, etc
Tell him that the Dutch eat chocolate sprinkles for breakfast
I remember first visiting the USA and getting very confused as to why they had these horribly worn dollar bills and all of these vending machines that accepted paper money
which were rejected by most of the vending machines due to the condition of most of the dollar bills

Glasgow
It’s Scotland’s largest city and Edinburgh’s rival
Every other city is either to small or to out if I he way
You could make an argument for Stirling since it used to be the capital and is a bit more central than any other city, but it’s barely more than a large town
Inverness/northern area so the government would be forced to give money to places other than the central belt
Glasgow because it’s the biggest city in Scotland and probably the most important
In Scotland it would probably be Glasgow since it’s the only other “big” city
You could maybe put it in Sterling just to have it close to the centre of the country
There's a case for keeping Westminster as the capital of England and as the site of the English Parliament and English Government, but moving the capital of the UK, and the UK Parliament & Government, to another (preferably northern) city
However, present constitutional arrangements don't allow that, because there are no separate English-only institutions
Inverness
For either the British capital, the Scottish capital, or both
Mostly just to confuse things, but it might also help inject the area and the Highlands more generally with more people, bringing more services to the Highlands
In Scotland it would probably be Glasgow since it’s the only other “big” city
You could maybe put it in Sterling just to have it close to the centre of the country
I just assumed Copenhagen was on Jutland for the longest time because why would any self-respecting country have its capital on the non-mainland bit

Kirkwall is orkney, but your point still stands

Hmmm it’s complicated
Lots of people like the EU here but I wouldn’t say we are very important
But compare to England we are very divided
You either love the EU or you despise it, the cities tend to love it but a lot of villages especially around where I live that have been devastated by overfishing couldn’t give you one nice word about the EU
We’re the country that reminds everyone else that asking your population to vote for or against something half of them had never heard of and the other half didn’t understand is actually a bad idea
Who could’ve predicted that
We're probably the main reason the EU doesn't just completely disown Britain tbh, even though Scotland is more or less the same as England, but we're more popular because we have less prominent politicians and some mountains and cool geographical shit
We'll have your back when we rejoin
Could you explain it to me from Austria's POV
Yeah, I expect things wanting out of the UK would go Ireland or thr Netherlands tbh
Part of why claims we'd get it if we left the UK seemed
over optimistic
Why wouldn't they go with the two more obvious, proven nation states
And yeah, Ireland is a good source of animal productd
Think you also have a decent tech market for certain products
It really is
From a Scottish anti-brexiter's perspective, it would perhaps make the most sense to do that, but it ignores one crucial thing: national identity
Think about Armenia/Azerbaijan right now and the Balkans conflicts and everything else around national identity
What might make the most sense from an outside point of view may not outweigh what the people inside believe
Crucially, that identity will be strong enough for people to fight for
I have known people from NI that will tell you off for calling them Irish because they identify as British, I have known people that also don't give a fuck or would prefer unity
Remember there were people in Northern Ireland who voted for Brexit
So unification doesn't cater to their wants (although I bet they'd be significantly better off if it could happen peacefully)
Anyway this is just one Scot's perspective, and as someone who lives in the city which has bastardised Irish politics into a reason for football hooligans to stab each other, take my thoughts with a pinch of salt
There are political parties in Ireland for whom unification is a goal - with or without Brexit
Me and the boys going to Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch
Yeah Poland was and is doing a lot of undemocratic things but Hungary blocks any consequence (and vice-versa)
Sorry we left you in this shitshow then
I hope brexit has minimal effect on the EU
Yeah it's a shitshow
Even just knowing that I live in a country that voted against Brexit, yet we are getting dragged out anyway infuriates me
I can't imagine what it is like for the Republic of Ireland having no say whatsoever
You are absolutely right
Don't worry, I'm fully aware of how the vote was counted
I think it just highlights an ongoing political divide that often screws Scottish people over
Eg, we always have widespread yellow constituencies (for foreigners, the voting areas are almost all won by the left, pro indy Scottish National Party), yet we get Tory government in Westminster
I understand that that is how the system works, but in many ways its not working for us
Its crazy to vote for things, knowing a majority of your country will also vote your way, then still lose
Very true
I am thankful for devolution, especially given how we have education and health under our control
I think most Scots who are well versed on this topic will fully sympathise with all the English people having those feelings
I think the last decade has been significant for Scots, who've realised there may be better systems than what Westminster currently offers
Which would have been put to rest had Brexit - one of the BIGGEST reasons people voted against independence - not occurred
You're welcome to join us if it does ever happen
Perhaps I've just been really lucky but my experience with the NHS has been nothing but positive
I will say though that the mental health services here leave much to be desired
The NHS is so popular in the UK that the debates during elections are about which party is going to protect it best
A huge number of people voted for brexit because they were told "we send 350 million a week to the EU, let's give that money to the NHS instead".
The Conservative party want to dismantle the NHS and are currently in the process of doing it, but to get into power they have to say the complete opposite to the public
I totally agree the reasons for brexit are myriad and complex, I was just highlighting how all movements in the UK claim to be champions of the NHS to gain popularity because it's so universally seen as a good thing
In my opinion reducing funding to breaking point, adding more and more systems whereby the NHS must pay the private sector and has reduced bargaining power is the process by which you stealthily dismantle the NHS when you don't have the political capital to do it blatantly
I suppose they might be doing it by indifference rather than premeditation but the end result is the same
They fundamentally don't believe the state should provide people with services and act to reduce the instances of that happening wherever possible (except for nuclear weapons and aircraft carriers)
Irish
And probably Gaelic as well
Hungary tbh
I'm fairly certain for things like "knife" and "knight" the k was actually pronounced until it wasn't
Yeah, nothing wrong with it, just very confusing from my perspective
Yeah, the spelling, sentence structure and other grammar stuff
It's just pretty different from other European languages
I mean, Irish spelling still makes more sense than English, but I've gotten used to that one
The rise of Mussolini in Italy
Closer to home probably all (pre-1980s) wars involving Britain except WWI, WWII and the Scottish Wars of Independence
And Bonnie Prince Charlie’s Jacobites I suppose
For example I know next to nothing about the English Civil War, and how Scotland got involved
I'm really shocked no one from the UK has said the Irish famine and British-Irish relations in general
It's a completely whitewashed part of our history
The **only** thing I remember being told was that Ireland ran out of potatoes which caused people to starve, as if it was their fault (or as if that was anywhere close to the truth)
I'd say that in this area, it borders on the education system just lying to school pupils
Go to a pub in Glasgow, you’ll find plenty of Northern Irish history experts there
I suspect when they were using British and English interchangably, American-style
> Literally anything to do with Ireland - one of our closest neighbours and yet I don't think I learnt one thing about Ireland in school
I took history right to fourth year (so 15/16)
The only time Ireland was even mentioned for us was briefly mentioning that Ireland was exempt from concscription in the First World War
No mention as to why or anything
Thank you for this interesting write up
I definitely need to learn more about this
We did Hitler’s rise to power in high school but nothing about Italy
Yeah that’s how it was presented here
Rich central belt landowners kicking out poor highland tenants in favour of sheep farms
I suppose it makes sense that you learn it in NZ as that’s how so many Scots ended up down there
I don’t know much about the English education system I’m afraid
Scotland has its own independent system
Part of the terms of the 1707 Act of Union IIRC, along with keeping our own banknotes and courts/legal system
We don’t do GCSE’s up here, it’s Nat4/Nat5 (although I did Standard Grades under the old system) and Highers/Advanced Highers instead of A-levels
But we’re not taught anything about the Empire either
As a nation we like to paint ourselves as an imperial victim, which I think is shameful
Wear your orange Dutch national team shirt for the full effect
I’m not much better, most of my Irish history is from Ireland Simpsons Fans on Facebook and The Wind That Shakes the Barley
I can see how indoctrinating kids early would cause problems for a few generations at least
I don’t know much about the modern far-right in Italy beyond some Lazio fans and Mussolini’s granddaughter getting bullied by Celtic fans on twitter
Was much done to de-fascistify Italy after the war
Calling it the “Agricultural Revolution” is a bit annoying tbh
It’s known here as the Highland Clearances
Massive areas of Scotland were cleansed at the whim of a few rich landlords
To this day their descendants own much of the highland land
It was a destruction of highland culture as much as it was a financial decision
Even today Scotland is in dire need of land reform
We’re very proud of our ‘right to roam’ laws here, but they only exist because of our backwards land ownership rules
I could be talking shite, but I’m sure it was included in the act of union
I’m not sure how the current Scottish system teaches our imperial history (I left school in 2015) but we’re finally having a national conversation about our role in the slave trade, which is encouraging and long overdue
No need to skip mate, thank you for educating me
It varies a bit from place to place, but here's mine:
7 fifty minute periods a day on Mondays and Tuesdays, and 6 on Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays
We don't get any time to get to our classes, even though it can take up to 7 minutes to get from one side to another
We just sprint, haha
Try and make it to registration at 8:45 (my bus is always late lmao) and classes start at 9:00
1st period is 9:00-9:50, 2nd is 9:50-10:40, then 20 minutes for break
3rd period is 11:00-11:50, 4th is 11:50-12:40
On mon and tues, we would have 5th period after this, at 12:40-13:30, however during the rest of the week, lunch starts at that time
Lunch on mon and tues is 13:30-14:20
5th period is 13:30-14:20 (wed, thurs, fri), 6th is at 14:20-15:10
School ends on wed, thurs, fri, at 15:10, however we have a 7th period on mon and tues, at 15:10-16:00, meaning school ends at 16:00 then
As for actual classes, we can have double and triple periods
S1-3 have to have:
3 periods of PE (physical education),
1 of RMPS (religious, moral, philosophical studies),
2 french,
1 PSE (personal, social education)
S3s also have to pick a subject from each area of the curriculum
In S4, you're free to choose whatever
S4-5 have to have 3 PE, but nothing else
In S6, you don't have to take PE
You can drop out at the end of S4 or later
For high school:
Starts at 08:30
On Monday and Tuesday, There is 7 classes
On Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, There is 6 classes
Each class is 40 mins
Break is 15 mins
Lunch is 30 mins
Ends at 3:20 on Monday and Tuesday
Ends at 2:30 on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday
So my day started when I woke up at 7:30, bus (which went straight to school) at 8:05
Get into school for 8:35 start
Then registration (or regi) apart from on Mondays when we had assembly
Class would start at 9 and each period would be 40 minutes
Most classes would be doubles (1hr 20 mins) but some classes would be singles
Only in fifth and sixth year could you get triples and that was normally in very few circumstances
First three periods would run (9:00-9:40, 9:40-10:20, 10:20-11) then break would be 20 minutes till 11:20
Then there would be two more periods 11:20-11:55 and 11:55-12:35 which would be lunch
Then 40 minutes from 12:35-13:15 for lunch
Then triple period again running 13:15-13:55,13:55-14:35,14:35-15:15) finish meaning school ended at three 15
One day a week would be games day, (Tuesday) and Thursdays was extra games and Saturdays
Some clubs would also run like the cadets and debating society after school
Home for 4
Most days which I would walk home because I was less pressed for time unlike in the mornings
That fact was my highlight of my big green bus tour
In Scotland it has to be Hogmanay (our word for New Year’s Eve)
I know that every country has their own New Year traditions but for us it’s a whole different kettle of fish with wild public parties and where even house parties tend to spill into the general local environment
*Example of a note to neighbours when throwing such a party my family write:*.
*“On Hogmanay I am throwing a party at my flat upstairs
If the people and music are too loud and keeping you up, you are welcome to join us instead”. *
Then there’s the traditions of bringing people coal and exchanging gifts when you enter one another’s houses for the first time after midnight and the day of family dinners to the same extent as Christmas
I didn't even know what the queens jubilee was so I had to google it and I still don't even get it, I'm not so sure about that answer for the whole of the uk
In Scotland, that day happened yesterday
ohh, so that's what it's referring to
I thought it was on about a specific milestone for the amount of years she's been a queen, like once every 10 years or something
but yeah, if it's on about her birthday then this answer really doesn't fit here, I'd say only a very tiny population really cares at all about the queen or her birthday
are you sure
I really don't know anyone at all who celebrates it or even knows when this jubilee's meant to be, maybe it's just something that's very regional, but I find it really hard to think that it's celebrated by the majority
I lived in Gibraltar when I was a teenager and one of the traditions they took from Spain was the Three Kings Parade
I have been whacked in the face by far too many hard candies
I think they enjoy throwing them
[Scottish]
Fleeto
Best trackie wearers in Europe
I think there's something distinctly Scots about the musician Ewan Henderson
I can't quite pin down what it is, it's almost the slight look of surprise
That picture is spot on Spanish lol
I’d say Edinburgh more than anywhere else
Every year we have a giant summer festival that brings in hundreds of thousands of tourists, and even when that’s not on, most of the people you’ll see around the city centre are tourists
Glasgow city centre is often quite touristy too
The highlands are also full of campsites, hikes, rental holiday homes and pretty mountains, so they also tend to get somewhat swamped in the summer, particularly by tourists from England
The highlands (around Inverness and Fort William), Edinburgh and Glasgow
There’s a lot note beautiful areas (islands, further north, Grampians, Cairngorms, etc
), but I get why nobody really ‘explores’ the central belt
It’s just ex-mining towns, council estates and fields
Edinburgh, especially the royal mile
Biggest tourist trap in Scotland
Glasgow around Buchanan and Sauchiehall street too but not to the same degree
Definitely Edinburgh
In fact, during August it is almost impossible to do anything in Edinburgh because the Fringe festival is on
Obviously it's not on this year because of Covid
Was weird when I cycled through to Edinburgh on Saturday just past and it was dead in comparison to how it usually is this time
Glasgow gets nowhere near the level of tourists Edinburgh gets
(I don't have any stats to back that up, I'm just going off of my experiences of living in Glasgow)
Did you grow up in Dublin by any chance
Maybe the Spanish really like alcoves
Is this the right word, alcoves
I know but still more than pretty much anywhere else in the country (not including the places I already mentioned)
Saying that you are from Kent is probably more akin to saying you are from an American county, and most Brits won’t know those
We know our own counties because there are not that many of them and each has its own ‘identity’.
I would say each state is more comparable to a country
I mean perhaps you don’t know every country in Europe but you probably know most of them
Yeah I would say the average person has heard of most of the 50 States
Obviously if you said I'm from Burlington Vermont people might not know exactly where it is but they have heard of the state
That's not weird
I go on pretend road trips all the time
Oh, maybe I'm weird
> But, tbh, people probably already knew you were from the US the moment you spoke, just like they would for any other English-speaking country
Worth noting, quite a lot of people have subtler accents so it's not always a good thing to trust accents, given the number of Irish and Scottish people with subtler accents that foreigners read as English (doesn't get mistaken as much by actually English people) and a fair few Americans have subtle enough accents that I've assumed they were British until they specified otherwise
It's a very imprecise and often misleading using just accents
>British counties can be more difficult as they can usually believably be English, Scottish or Irish
Oh, the poor Welsh
Quick quiz: d'ya know the UK's four home nations
That is true, but many of them are based on historical counties and they have similar names
Yorkshire is not a single county anymore, but most people have an idea where it is and it definitely has an identity
Where I fall down personally is London boroughs, Welsh and Northern Irish counties
I know some but not all
Probably worth specifying, the UK isn't currently federal, there have been pushes to federalise it, but its never happened
There is a weird system due to how it formed from several well developed countries, never really fully integrating them (the Scottish legal system never really merged with the English one, etc), and the idea of being a country of co-equal nations (something similar to, IDK, Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, theoretically an equal partnership)
So it can look like a weird federalisation due to that, continuing national identities (most Scots, Welsh, and Emglish identify as Scots, Welsh, or English, not British in the census), and the devolved parliaments and assemblies
We have a really weird system due to the really weird history of these isles
Correct
Just since that's never a given, despite being you'd think one of the more accessible ones
At least I wouldn't hear you say 'this is such a lovely part of England' on a train in Scotland :D
My pals learning a bit of greek and he's struggling with it a lot lol
I'm not happy I'm getting dragged out
Yes
Although desperately sad that my country (Scotland) is being dragged out of the EU by a neighbour (England)
I miss it already :(</3
Fuck yes
Being dragged out of it, but hopefully Scotland will rejoin
It's almost as if the slow, pragmatic, negotiated, compromising centrism of the EU really does, on the whole, result in decent, acceptable, sensible outcomes
I'd love to, just make a pint much less than £8 and we're sorted
> generally it is hard to track
Surely not
We track who votes already in the UK by having their names marked off a sheet in a polling station when they turn up to vote
The only difference is they'd have much larger lists, and fines would be issued to the names not checked off at the end of the day
Very similar to the typical American ones
Probably some more pro communist ones than America though
The scary one for me is homeopathy as it's achieved a degree of official and royal support
No you haven't
The Scots Wikipedia is a bit of a laughing stock, as it appears the vast majority of it was created by an American teenager who didn't actually speak Scots
It didn't really make a difference as most Scottish people would read and write in English in formal/factual communication and only use Scots informally amongst themselves
(Which is also why the Scots Wikipedia problems went unspoken about until Rian raised it)
Well there was a Scots version of Wikipedia but it was barely comprehensible so I can’t really speak to the information accuracy
this doesn't really fit 100% since (in my opinion) scots isn't a language on its own, but there is a scots wikipedia which some American teen started iirc and he literally just used some online scots dictionary to translate some words, and if he couldn't find a translation he would just type it out in what he thought a scottish accent sounded like
He had been doing this for absolute years, dismissed actual scottish people telling him he was just typing what was basically broken English and edited thousands of articles
[Here's] the reddit post that sort of blew it up if anyone's interested
It is a bit of a shame because people are guessing he has autism, because there's no way your typical person is going to be obsessed with anything to the degree he was
Scotland: tap water is pure quality
You’d only drink bottle water if you were out and about and parched
Scotland’s got surprisingly clean tap water so as a kid I never understood pre-bottled water
Still think it’s a scam
I live in Scotland and in the UK all tap water is 100% potable by design and infrastructure
The quality of said water varies drastically by location
For example:
An old acquaintance of mine from the Highlands and Islands in Scotland came to Edinburgh and found the water difficult to stomach slightly at first, because theirs came literally from the freshest and most beautiful streams
Perfect water
I grew up in Edinburgh and I drink tap water like it’s the nectar of the gods
It’s beautiful, clear, cold and refreshing straight from the tap
It’s extremely hard water and comes from the local hills
That old acquaintance of mine once visited London and threw up when he tasted it
He couldn’t at all
I visited London a year later and while I spent 10 minutes gagging trying to get it down
It was vile
We both ended up drinking bottled during our stays
All the water is drinkable and a lot of people do, and while all water is equal, some waters are more equal than others
Yes, it wasn’t until a few years ago I realised it wasn’t the norm in other countries
It was crazy to me
You get free tap water at restaurants too
Yea, it's very clean here in Scotland
You can get it in restaurants for free, why pay for clean water when we have it straight from the Highlands to our taps
Yep, since we’re up north, our tap water is surprisingly nice
Yeah, I got so into the habit of just asking for a glass of tap water when I’m out that I did the same in Spain and the waiter gave me such a weird look
Correct
I absolutely fucking grudge having to buy water
If I do buy a bottle for the car or motorbike, that bottle gets refilled until it falls to bits haha
Is it hard water
I’m pretty sure all of Scotland has very soft water especially when compared to England
I’ve just got myself a thermal water bottle
Best thing I’ve done in ages
Don’t even uses glasses now
Come back hours later and the waters as cold as if it just came out the babbling brook
For the village that I live in:
&#x200B;
Someone's dog keeps on getting out and scaring another neighbour's chickens, the first neighbour keeps on apologising and giving her food items as an apology but egg production is down
God in heaven whatever shall we do
local council in my area sold a lorry park for like under  £5k that they realised they need and is now paying more than £1k a month for it
probably catholic vs protestant sectarianism
Same here in the UK
Fucking crackpots
I always feel rather self conscious as a 20s British man whenever I visit, well pretty much anywhere in Europe that isn't one of the large rich countries for this reason
Same, but for Scotland, Edinburgh and Glasgow are always visited, but no one visits my random town in the middle of bum fuck nowhere
We have a hill, and some shops, and a hotel somewhere, I think
Yeah I think I probably get treated better than my English friends but still I'm an English speaker
Murcia
I had it in my head it was a region, not a city
Duisburg, Germany
I'm quite pleased I made it that far down to be honest
The next one after that is Szczecin, Poland
\#66 Bochum, Germany
At least it's 9 more than in the US
Kept going and second unknown was #88 Karlsruhe, Germany
Also didn't know #92 Craiova, Romania
The list ended just one after that though
I have a friend who sings it at karaoke, can confirm it is the only reason I have heard of Lodz
A lot of speakers have started using the dative pronouns instead of the genitive ones in many cases, or will rephrase sentences to use dative constructions
The canonical example is:
Wegen des Wetters (Genitive) vs
wegen dem Wetter (Dative)
It's so widespread that there is a book about contentious issues in German grammar, orthography etc
that's entitled (tongue firmly in cheek) "Der Dativ ist dem Genitiv sein Tod" (literally - "the dative is to the genitive its death"), rather than "Der Dativ ist der Tod des Genitivs" ("The dative is the death of the genitive")
>to finally create a large and unique European state
Do most people even want that
The two general things would be the cultural heritage of Roman influence and Christianity but those things are far from unique to Europe
>forgets to shut door

I always got "were you born in a field
In the UK, If you see a Scottish man with a bow and arrow in the city of York
You are legally allowed to shoot them
Oh boy here we go
You are legally allowed to kill a scotsman with a bow in York
Not allowed to hold salmon suspiciously
Gambling is banned in public libraries
Coming into the house of commons with armour is illegal
As an MP you are legally not allowed to resign
Sugar Tax
If someone knocks on your door needing the toilet you must let them use it in Scotland
Irn Bru tastes awful, Pepsi tastes awful, Coke tastes awful and sweeteners are actually suspected that they are worst than sugar
"Lairig Ghru" is pronounced almost like "Larry Groo", so nope for gaelic
Just "the toilet"
Thistle is a great one to test non native English speakers
It gets the tongue moving and lots really struggle the 'th' anyway
"it's a braw nicht but the morns gan tae blaw a hoolie"
Or get them to pronounce "kirkgunzeon" and "Kirkcudbright".
I had friends from poland many years ago, and they really tried their best to get me talking polish
I learned some very basic stuff, and then the entirety of that poem
I’ve been told that my pronunciation is very good, and I am endlessly proud of that
Chrzaszcz remains my favourite word in polish) I have to omit the special a cause iphone keyboard has everything but that apparently
Loch too, though not for any language that has the hard ch sound as well
Place names are great for non-scots
Milngavie trips people up not just for the spelling
Also never met an American who could pronounce Edinburgh straight off the bat
Nope
More names with the same energy: Gloucestershire, Leicestershire
> Also fuck Yorkshire accents
They're my second favourite English (as in, from England) accent, after the West Country accent (also known as "pirate speech", they do the yarrs and arrrrs)
Sauchiehall Street anaw a lot of folk struggle with
Americans also find Glasgow difficult
Always say it Glas-gow instead of just Glas-go
In my experience, Americans from the Northeast manage to pronounce Worcester accurately, because Worcester is also a town in Massachusetts
Tbf the way -shire is pronounced nowadays is also butchering the "proper" (original) pronunciation
Our ancestors would be quite horrified by the way we say it
In Scotland we often use the endearing term of cunt,
"What's up cunts"
Any sort of swear works
Cunt, dickhead, arsehole, fucker, fuck head etc
The list is truly endless
“Mucker” is a slightly outdated word for friend, associated with Londoners but used and understood more widely than that
It’s probably the same word as “Makker”
I was wondering about the exact same thing
Lots of trade/contact between the East coast of England and the Low Countries over the centuries
(I don't recall hearing 'mucker' in Scotland, though
Mucker is common in Glasgow, or it used to be
I always thought it was someone you mucked about with, but maybe the derivation went the other direction, ie makker->mucker->muck about
Darling: ‘If it is true sir, we’ll have to cancel the push’
Melchett: ‘Exactly’
George: ‘damn’
Blackadder: ‘What a nuisance’
Melchett: ‘Exactly what the enemy would expect us to do and therefore exactly what we shan’t do’
Blackadder: ‘Ah now’
That team should never have been at the World Cup ireland should have gone Thierry Henry is a cheating bastard
Also worth mentioning that Ireland left the Commonwealth
In Iraq I met an Italian military captain who said he was a knight of Malta
I don't know whether it was true, but I have no reason not to believe him
He was a good fellow; he kept us supplied with wine
The Commonwealth is a fairly useful organisation
In my work (on democracy and development in the global south) I've had dealings with the Commonwealth Secretariat, the Commonwealth Judges and Magistrates Association and the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association - all of which do good work promoting democratic institutions and norms, the rule of law, human rights etc
The more subtle influences of the Commonwealth include scholarships (when I was working in the South Pacific, I met several people who received university education through Commonwealth funds) and cultural exchanges (there's an association for Commonwealth writers, for example)
Now you mention it, I think there might have been
I've met plenty of Spanish scouts, so there must be some -
I've met Russian scouts, so you must have something similar
In Europe
Where do you think they started :o
I'm really shocked at that
Scouting worldwide has always had a really strong following across Europe
It really shocks me to see people think that the USA scouts are representative when they're *so* different to the rest of the planet
Yeah that page has indicative numbers and they're tiny
The biggest group has fewer members than Scouts Scotland, and as a country we're about a tenth of the size
Yeah, I understand that, it's just a big surprise to me
I would have thought that Spanish people would know more about neighbouring countries I guess
Do you think it changes massively, regionally
There's loads here in central Scotland, parts of the Antonine wall, some bath houses and stuff like that
Areas like Bearsden, Cumbernauld and I think Kilsyth have preserved their roman sites and have plaques up to explain what you're looking at
Schools are named after saints martyred by the Romans (well the catholic ones are), streets have names like Antonine Way and Roman Road
It's not uncommon to find roman items if they're excavating fields for housing development
Yes Hadrian's wall being most famous, then maybe the Antonnine wall
They didn't come up too far because there wasn't much here
The proclaimers - I’m gonna be

So myself and my Polish ex were in creperie in Paris, waitress didn't have English but we persevered and got the food we wanted
Mid meal another waitress came in for a shift change and both her and our previous waitress turned out to be Polish
We all had a good laugh about it
A Ukrainian women started speaking Russian to me in a bar in Berlin
I was very confused and told her I only speak English she said ‘I’m sorry I thought you were Russian, you have a very Russian face’.
It was very strange as I’ve never thought I looked Slavic at all and the only nationalities I’ve been guessed as in the past are English, Irish (both of which are pretty common for Scots) and German
I guess this woman’s East Slav radar is faulty
I have lightish brown hair but this is the most common colour in the UK as well
I have quite high cheekbones but they’re not wide
Also I’m slightly freckled and I thought this was less common in Slavic peoples
Maybe I look more Russian than I’d previously thought though
I think this is pretty much exclusively an American problem
Cumber fucking nauld it's basically a monument to the "brutalist" architecture of the 50s/60s and has won the worst city in Scotland more than 3 times
With one poll in a channel 4 documentary suggesting residents favoured knocking down the whole place
Don't knock it till you see it, you can enter the happiest man in the world and leave depressed as fucking anything
Drumchapel, Scotland
I'm just happy no one is bullying Inverness, if I'm honest
Blandest, most boring, soulless
I'm not sure, I've liked most cities I've been to, they usually have something that makes me interested
The only one I just felt a bit hollow visiting and leaving was Basel, but that was first day in Switzerland and overcast, so it just felt
meh
That said, definitely not a fair evaluation, but it is the city I've actually had a potter about in a felt the most underwhelmed
I wasn't there for long so I can't say fot sure but I couldn't see any soul in Antwerp
Glenrothes
Yous have never been to Arkhangelsk I'm guessing
I did and that was the "yeah I've had enough Russia for a while" moment for me
Stirling
This town is coming like a ghost town
I loved Linz when I visited but it helped that my best mate had already been there for two months on Erasmus so he had time to explore
There was a tiny Irish pub down a lane off the Hauptplatz (the old Dubliner I believe it was called) and it was great
The Christmas Market was also great because it's nowhere near as crowded as the ones in the bigger cities (such as Innsbruck)
The Apfelpunsch was delightful as well
I also enjoyed walking up to the look out on the hill that overlooks the Danube
&nbsp;
It would be nice if Celtic were to draw LASK in the next round of the Europa League as it would give me an excuse to go back to Linz
> and cancel all incoming Ryan Air flights
Good thing that EasyJet still exist ;)
Yeah I agree with you
I got the impression that it was very much a living city but with a lot of amazing landmarks and a beautiful old town
It helped that I got some time to explore the city myself since my mate had classes to go to during the week
I get what you're saying about the Old Dubliner getting crowded, it's tiny
Oh and I forgot to mention that I took the Pöstlingbergbahn up to the Pöstlingberg-Kirche
That was beautiful as well
&nbsp;
You never know, if LASK don't beat Sporting CP in the last group game then there's definitely a chance that we draw each other
Until then, have an apfelpunsch for me at the markets :)
Scotland does for Scottish and EU citizens however we're not EU for long sadly
Depending on the course, it might be worth checking out Malta - one of the two countries in the EU (other than Ireland) where English is an official language
It has a good university for some subjects, less so for others
At 10K a year for "international" students, I doubt it
However as this is Scotland and we're lovers of our EU neighbours, perhaps we'll shimmy a wee gig for them
It's always nice not to take a loan if you dont have to
You're still saving money
Well you're basically saying "I'll make enough after graduation that I can pay this off easily"and that's a completely fair bargain to make but if you can work during uni and do the same then why not
Eh I'm not sure about that
In the UK even Scotland where uni is free and student loans are easy to get most people still have a job  for at least a night or two a week (though most people still get a loan too)
Its completely understandable if that's not what you want though
Empty bottles, they’re just laying around everywhere, broken glass too
Views of the Scottish highlands, they’re pretty cheap if you go from Scotland
Irn Bru is way cheaper as, one it’s sold on mass here
To it’s only really big market is here and 3 it’s made here
One of my favourites is Tattybogle
A useful translation is scarecrow, a literal translation is Potato Ghost
Bawbag = Ballbag which means Ballsack
Gaelic
Damhan-allaidh meaning fierce little stag (spider)
The thing about English is that it's such a mongrel, doggerel language, and so widely spoken as a second language - sometimes by people who don't speak it well well - that you can mangle it almost any way and it still more or less makes sense
Deer perhaps
With their love of randomly crossing roads and getting hit by cars, causing accidents and sometimes biting and chasing people who think it'd be fun to feed them
They're also extremely dangerous to the environment
I was sceptical but it seems deaths by dogs are comparable to cows (which kill 3 a year)
[The British Deer Society claims] that 10 people are killed each year in deer-related traffic accidents, but they seem to be a lobby group for the game industry so aren't exactly a reliable source
[Check out their latest news lmao]
In a basic sense in most republics (those without monarchies) the president is the head of state who does ceremonial things like opening new infrastructure projects or welcoming foreign dignitaries
Whereas the prime minister is the one who leads the executive branch of government that makes decisions
It wasn't common before, but I wouldn't be surprised if some government bodies choose to do it now as a statement of opposition to brexit
Well if I had a garden, I'll be flying it
Cannot wait until we re-join
I think the Scottish government flies it outside government buildings alongside the Scottish flag too
Banning flags would set an ill precedent
The UK government complains about the Scots Government flying the EU flag, but all they do is get pet journalists to write angry newspaper columns
The EU and Council of Europe share a flag, and the UK remains a member of the Council of Europe, so *technically* it's still a valid flag to fly, although any local authority flying it is almost certainly showing support for rejoining the EU
Trainspotting
Trainspotting
For Scotland I'd recommend Filth, Angels' Share, or Neds
I would have also included Trainspotting, but it's more likely people have already seen this, and the others are less likely to have been seen
Restless Natives
The Angel's Share
That sinking feeling
Bill Forsyth Scotland's greatest director
Also local hero
Train spotting
Trainspotting is up there, but for lesser known examples try Walter Wants To Kill Himself or even Slow West which is set in the USA but with Scottish characters and director
Trainspotting
One of the best films ever made to be honest with you
Such a good film
I can vividly remember at least three scenes from that film
The bit with the carp, the plastic glasses and whether halušky are gnocchi

Only to save us from aliens that have been fucking us over fir the last 50 years
Only to find Churchill locked in a closet
The queen is the head of state; PM is the head of government
I think she's better than Boris Johnson in pretty much every way
She has lead Scotland through covid in more decisive and skillful way
The only reason why I wouldn't want her as PM is because of Scottish independence
While I am a supporter of independence I think if we had a competent, more left-wing government I'd be more open to the idea of only having more devolution but there is the risk of a government like the current one being elected again
Which is a risk I wouldn't want to take
Yeah I'd agree to that but I think we'd be best of getting out while we still can and hopefully rejoining the EU
No genders, and one word for ‘the’. How batshit crazy the spellings and rules are without necessarily acknowledging that if you’re a native speaker
The amount of dialect words used for different things
Or how the question ‘Alright
’ isn’t necessarily a question, and not always asking if you are alright
Fair enough is great at ending conversations though
Haggis, mainly because it's got a sheep's heart, liver and lungs in it which I don't think is as weird/disgusting as people make it out to be
It does actually taste good though, especially on a roll imo
It's traditionally served with mashed neeps (turnips) and tatties/totties (potatoes),
Haggis is delicious and if you disgaree you're a cunt
Haggis, I think we all know what that is by now
Or a deep fried mars bar (chocolate bar)
Haggis gets loads of shite but I think it's really good
Haggis - Meat in a sheep bladder (or artificial packaging) along with oats and suet/spices
Square/Lorne Sausage - Minced meat mixed with oats and rusks and some traditional spices
You fry it on a pan with some oil and then put it in a roll (either crispy or morning roll) with lots of butter
Cranachan - A desert with some whisky, some oats, some strawberries and double cream
Pudding, meaning types of sausages comes from the French word boudin
Try living in Western Scotland
We might have some *daylight*, but the vast majority of the time it's an overcast nightmare
Glasgow gets about 1203h of sunshine per year, vs 1821h in Stockholm, 1780h I  Copenhagen, 1660h in Oslo, and even Reykjavik gets more at 1268h.
By choice
It is the cheese sandwich of countries: boring, but predictable
So much of south eastern Europe
Always on the borderlands of empires, but also with it's own unique diverse cultures as well
Scotland has lots of history, but with a singular external protagonist/antagonist; the swirling currents and changes of South Eastern European history are so much more interesting by comparison
Transylvania - so much more to it than vampire legends
Hanseatic League - not one place, but a whole network of autonomous city-republics that have a fascinating but often overlooked role in Northern European history
I know a little history of Latvia it's not great in a lot of bits
The siege of Malta during the Second World War is an incredible story, especially Operation Pedestal and the SS Ohio
*Three Elegies for Kosovo* is one of my favourite books as well, so slim, so few words, and yet so much said
If you haven't read it already, I recommend Kadere's *The Three Arched Bridge*, it has a very similar style and atmosphere to his Kosovo book
Can thank the church for some of the lack of interest too I'd think
There's Ae in Dumfries and Galloway
Not too sure if this counts but I think it might,in Scotland,the Gaelic name for the town iona is 'Ì',however our shortest place name in English is the village of Ae in Dumfries and Galloway
[Iona] is technically the shortest in gaelic as it’s sometimes called ì. The English one with the shortest is [Ae]
[E] a river in the Highlands
Another fun twinning- I grew up in the hamlet (population 81) of Dull in Scotland
When my mum’s friend was driving across the West of the US, she came across the town of Boring in Oregon
My mum brought the idea of twinning to the community council, and long story short, Dull and Boring are now twinned
She really had her 15 minutes of fame with that one lmao, she was getting constant requests for interview from news stations from all over the world for a week or so
People from both places have journeyed over to the other and it’s a proper twinning now
The town of Bland in Australia has also asked if they can take part
Yea so I guess technically there’s two
My Spanish wife and Italian neighbour could do the same - although occasionally they would both lapse into English
In the brazilian portuguese Harry Potter translation, all the given names with a clear equivalent were translated into their portuguese version, except the main 3 characters
But pretty much everyone else did (James = Tiago, Lily = Lílian, Remus = Remo, Bill = Gui, Oliver = Olívio)
So you get a lot of weird sounding phrases with a bunch of portuguese names being used for characters in a series full of british culture, town names and etc
I feel huge sympathy with the people of Paris for their cultural loss, as well as a sadness at the destruction of a famous and beautiful building, but no personal sense of losing anything
I used to play football with a guy who had posted in an Instagram pic with his girlfriend yesterday afternoon outside the Notre Dame, literally just a few hours before it went of fire
We'll sometimes use a sarcastic comment to someone meant in a friendly, mild rebuke, which seems to offend - or just generally confuse - folk from other cultures
For example, if you came in late to work, your boss might say, "the clocks changed weeks ago, min".
Howdy neighbourino
Or neighbourinalainen I guess
Bilingual people, do you feel you "change" or "adapt" parts of your personality when speaking different languages
I've lived in Brazil for over a decade and recently a brazilian friend of mine told me that my whole body language changes when he saw me speaking english with my dad
It's not the first time I was told something like that, and I've noticed my wife does it as well when she speaks japanese with her family
I do think that ESL people quite often swear a bit more than native English speakers, not all the time or in or places but I think it is a thing
I "toned down" my accent when speaking english with brazilians or americans since most people in my experience didn't understand me at all if I went full Glasgow while talking to them
But every time I visited Scotland while living overseas it would always come back pretty quickly
In fairness, I sometimes don't understand Glasweigins when they go full Glasgow in the Highlands
The look of visible relief when my Maltese friend discovered I didn't speak Glasgow is something that will stick with me for a while
Good on you man for not doubling down and trying to help people understand ya
Interesting, fiance is Creole-Cajun and is pathologically opposed to swearing
Would have assumed Canadian French were the same
someone's edited that clip to make it sound like absolute garble, but it's still funny as fuck
I find Germans and the Dutch to be very direct sometimes - I used to work for a company with a lot of management from both countries, it made for some very unambiguous communication which I really appreciated
Some people found it a little abrasive though
Edinburgh certainly is hated by Glaswegians, Dundonians, Aberdonians, Invernesians and indeed everyone else
But fuck them we're the capital
Edinburgh is sort of liked
Maybe a bit of rivalry between them and Glasgow, but aside from that its mostly liked, from my experience
Joked and mocked as being poshos, but it's generally a nice city to most
Dundee (Scumdee
) and Glasgow are ripped into more
Probably impossible to have a capital that is universally liked by all portions of the country, though
But I can't think of any intense hatred towards Edinburgh
> Edinburgh
Salt and sauce wankers, they can get tae fuck

Scottish independence is VERY different to Irish unification, which could not happen without a lot of bloodshed
The paramilitaries which fought in the troubles are still armed
It's not really that common to speak a second language here but I don't think anyone really cares
Then again Scots is considered a language to some people (I'd say more so a dialect) but there's still people who put it down as lower class slang
That's a bit harsh lol
> Anyway, if you want to come here for a year or so, english is all you need
If you want to live here for the rest of your life, we appriciate you learning Dutch
This the Catch-22 of the Netherlands: You can live here for x years speaking only English, but if you want to live here for x+1 years, you are suddenly expected to speak fluent Dutch, which you are supposed to have learned automatically without ever being able to practice it
England's contributions to modern music
The Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Queen, etc
Though it's a mostly joint effort by Irish/UK television but Father Ted is by far one of Ireland's greatest exports
It’s a difficult decision between Katie Hopkins and Nigel Farage
Honestly one of the people who spreads vile hatred on twitter
Maybe like Katie Hopkins because she's not even clever she's just daft
Scotland - Katie Hopkins
The UK - Shawn Mendes (just to annoy my pal)
If the Americans would like keep that odious little scrote Nigel Farage confined to their country now that's he fucked off over there again that'd be great
Aye I imagine it's fucking back breaking to whip out a wave to the peasants from her ***literal palace*** every now and then
Slightly different in Scotland
If you want to change your name in Scotland, you can just do it, providing it's not for the purposes of deceit or fraud
No paperwork required
If you want to have it recorded officially you do this by statutory declaration, which can be done by a notary public or a justice of the peace
Note that this only applies to people who were born or adopted in Scotland
If you were born elsewhere you have to go through the process of the country you were born in

>tfw I now remember that the HMS Warspite was scrapped instead of being preserved as a museum ship
>cry
The Royal Navy was the pride of the UK for centuries, our sword and shield, and we didn't preserve a single battleship from World War II :(
It’s an occasional pub quiz question
eh doesnt really bother me
there doing there best
No annoying
If am in my own city and someone walks up to me trying to speak English al be able to help them and obviously wouldn’t be annoyed at them trying
Majority of the time the persons English will be better than my knowledge of their language
Probably difficulty to answer for English speakers given how widely spoken English is in Europe
Which is huge luck given how poor and lazy British people are with languages in general
But anyone getting annoyed by something like that is a wee tadger
I speak a bit of French (or I used to), but my listening comprehension is poor at normal speeds
I haven’t had much success at getting French people to speak v e r y   s l o w l y  to give me a chance to understand them
We always end up speaking English, and I’m always disappointed
When the roles are reversed and I’m at my work speaking to foreign tourists or workers I adjust my accent and vocabulary and speak slowly
Even competent speakers would struggle otherwise
Most definitely whiskey and haggis maybe a bit of shortbread too
Reddit loves weed which makes it biased
Yeah but there should be limits to it so you can't smoke it all day every day
Yes though it's a lot more dangerous than what a lot of the current culture likes to admit
Also it shouldn't be taxed, that's just a bad idea
It makes the state partially dependent on drug sales
Yeah, as long as it's regulated it's safe
> IIRC there was a study in Colorado like a year after they legalized it and the use had gone down, so maybe legalizing it would take down the amount of addicts
Don't have a source so don't quote me on it though

Used to think I lived about 10 mins away from the English border when infact I live about 2 hours away if theres minimal traffic
That's not that much of a stretch
Sinai was occupied by Israel for 15 years, and Chechnya was de facto independent as well for most of the 90s.
Exactly what I'd expect from Prussians
In fairness, for quite a while it essentially was, iirc, due to fortified border with Francoist Spain
It's also a British Overseas Territory, so not a terrible assumption, even if inaccurate
Don't worry about it
I'm lucky enough to live across the street from a coffee roaster, but if I really like Marcilla (Spanish brand) and Delta coffee from Portugal
This looks good, and for a coffee machine it's really cheap
I've dated girls from Spain, Italy and Poland
With the Spanish and Italian girls, there was definitely quite a large humour disconnect
I found I had to make jokes really obvious and clownish to make it known I was telling a joke; the Polish girl was a lot more comfortable with the Scots way of trying to be funny
> In the Uk it’s really not all that special to have a threesome or even open up your relationship when it’s long distance
Isn't it
You'd have to have a sense of humour if you came from Paisley
Well, it sure as hell wasn't my looks
I never found quite the same issue with Germans or Scandinavians, sometimes they didn't get it, but I also found that they were very good at pretending they didn't get it in order to turn a deadpan joke back on you (and I fell for it multiple times
With Spanish folk, it was almost like having to pick up a megaphone and shout "this is a joke
YOU WILL NOW LAUGH, BECAUSE THIS IS A JOKE". I'm maybe being a bit judgemental, but it meant the Spanish sense of humour came across as quite childish to me
> .i think they also find it harder to laugh at themselves on the continent
I think this is broadly true, but I think northern Europeans are generally better at laughing at themselves than southern Europeans
Ach, maybe I'm just conservative
I can imagine the threesomes being more common than I thought, but opening-up in a long-distance relationship surprises me a lot, to be honest
Someone from Paisley absolutely does *not* sound Doric
(Sorry, I'm from the north east, where we do speak Doric, and to us, Paisley folk sound very different, much closer to Glaswegian in dialect)
> He used to wear his kilt to school occasionally as well as a Liverpool jersey
Call him a traitor and ask why it wasn't a St

:-p
We're quite self-depricating, we like to mock arrogance and people that take themselves too seriously, and a lot of the humour comes from quick, witty comments and mocking each other
The jokes tend to be quite deadpan, and the humour can tend towards the dark (we're slowly moving away from the old "be racist and homophobic and just pretend it's dark humour" pish)
The sketch-show *Burnistoun* is probably good "starter-pack" to get an idea of what Scots find funny
I think you're right, language makes a huge difference, but I do also think there's a cultural element as well
>I think not
We have a good bunch of sad humor jokes about italy
I always pictured brits or other ex colonial countries as less good in self deprecation humor because they still felt their colonial past, that “we are superior”, that “fallen noble” thing
I wasn't talking about the country, rather the individual
And, in my experience, the worst ex-colonial country for the "fallen noble" thing is definitely Spain
I just find Northern Europeans are more likely to mock themselves, whereas Southern Europeans are much more likely to take themselves seriously as an individual
It's not even an arrogance thing - once your ear is tuned to it, you realise that brits can demonstrate arrogance through self-deprecation - e.g., I mind a really posh english person telling me, "I didn't go anywhere special for university, just a nothing-little-backwater town on the road from London to Birmingham".  That was their way of boasting they'd been to Oxford University
They were absolutely trying to show-off, but making sure to be seen to be using self-deprecation as they did it
I'm Scottish, so not my "language", but I learned Castillian Spanish quite well during my teens and ended up sharing a flat with an Argentinian girl once
She was always horrified when I used the verb "coger" in everyday language chatting with her
Eventually she had to tell me to stop as in her dialect it meant "to fuck" instead of "to take" and I was effectively going around talking about fucking her and other mundane things
Generational focus is just America's way of not allowing people to talk about class and economic inequality
But I'll tell you one thing: millenials in the 1% are not spending all their money on avocado toast, failing to get on the property ladder, or struggling to pay student debts while underemployed in the gig economy
Yep
It's a load of fucking shite
Everyone blaming the generation up/down for things that were ultimately caused by rich people, hurting us all
Thank god it doesn't seem to be a thing here
Yeah, and everyone born between 1980 and 1996 has the same beliefs, ethics, philosophies, interests, tastes, behaviours etc
The Battlefield at Culloden (near Inverness) has a really creepy reputation
The last battle on British soil was fought there in 1746, concluding the jacobite rebellions
Rebel troops were massacred as they attempted to charge across marshland to reach the government troops
Many more were killed as they tried to escape
The battlefield is eerie, the birds dont sing there and people are always reporting paranormal happenings
Hartwood Hospital
Opened in 1895 and was once the largest psychiatric asylum in Europe and the first place in Scotland to perform a lobotomy, among many other controversial therapies and procedures
It's been abandoned for years now, but people often make it past the guards
Hermitage castle is one of the creepiest places I have ever been to, its in the middle of nowhere and the whole place gives off a weird vibe
It has a lot of bad history with people starving each other to death and torturing people
Although there are absolutely dozens of creepy/haunted places in Scotland
[Hermitage Castle]
[Haunted Places in Scotland]
In Scotland, it’s practically used as punctuation
Generally not a massive deal
Don't say around kids, etc
That said, remember it is a swear
Which sounds obvious, but you do occasionally see people who are non-native speakers here and abroad just throw the word 'fuck' around like it's an 'um' or something, to fill space, and that is going to be looked down upon or at least grate upon people (even if those people are ok with curses)
Really, be like using your own swears: context is key and just remember that they can be offensive, so don't throw them out with every other breath
If you swear in front of a child/school teacher/parents yes and if you use it directed at someone "fuck you," fuck off" yeah
Otherwise nah ya silly cunt
Dunno about England but noone in Scotland gives a fuck
From my experience in England they are more partial to words lik ‘bloody’ ‘bleeding’ or ‘heck’ etc etc
British =/= English
Very location dependant
England is more uptight overall than the rest of the UK but you'll find your areas it's much more okay than others
Nah fuck that   ^
"Cheers cunt, this shits fucking sick" is a perfectly acceptable parting phrase once you've picked up something nice off Oxford Street
Northern Americans are touchy about swearing or "cursing" haha
bleeding commonly heard in bath, bristol and outer london
heck in the south west and south
but yes i imagine it is a geographic thing
also a generational thing
a lot of older folk tend to avoid swearing i find
Truth
Also the
... The South
Shit in English is your excrement
So if something is shit, shitty or shite (last one is British English, particularly Scottish) then you're giving it the attribute of or being like what you flushed down the toilet earlier that morning
By itself however it's just another curse word but that's what your shit is
London and some of the area around it you're maybe alright but the rest of the South
I repeat:
>I do reckon Glasgow wins though
And with that I'll take my leave, cheers cunts
No, with "poop" people are gonna look at you like your mental age is a bit
Behind
Whereas "shit" is a swear word here and over in NA so you'll be looked at like you've just said a curse word in public
a burn
English (kind of) does it too
It's just we disguise it by putting spaces in the middle of our compound words
I think it's a bit of a generational divide here: I've been able to have fairly open conversations with people around my age (20-40) however it becomes a less open field at ages above that
It's almost like you were never to talk about it before for whatever reason but it helps you to gauge what people make in whatever the job is that they do so you have an idea what's out there
Bragging obviously isn't cool but that's going to be the person, not the money
I think the real question here is who has conversations around water fountains
I've seen a mostly equal mix between black and green olives here
Yeah kids walked or cycled too and from school by them self or in a group of kids from about age 9 or 10
Depends on how far away it is and how young they were
I was walking to school without my parents when I was 5, but I lived quite close to the school
Yes especially teens they walk around like they own the place
This is actually a really interesting question from a Scottish perspective, because much of our slang and dialect is taken from old Scots, rather than old English
History lesson since most of you are probably very unfamiliar with Scots: Scots is a splinter of old English that diverged from its cousin around the 12th century, and became the dominant language in the lowlands and, to a lesser extent, the highlands (before this both regions where largely dominated by Gaelic, with the odd pocket of Norse remaining in the at-the-time Norwegian territories)
Over the years, Scots and English kind of merged to create what I’ll call Modern Scots, which is what’s spoken in the majority of Scotland today, but there are still many areas where the dialect people speak borrows a hell of a lot more from Scots than English
What’s curious about Scots is that it hasn’t really changed that much over the centuries, particularly in the last 250 years or so in which the works of Rabbie Burns have been extremely popular
A modern Scots speaker could have never heard of Burns (unlikely as it is), and yet would probably be able to read *Tae a Moose* perfectly
‘The best-laid schemes o’ Mice an’ Men
Gang aft agley,
An’ lea’e us nought but grief an’ pain,
For promis’d joy
Love that line from Tae a Moose
Also where the book ‘Of Mice and Men’ gets its name
I love comparing Scots to Norse languages, so many similarities
Bairn, Kirk, flit, mucke, braw, etc
Even that weird inhaling way teuchters (beautiful Scots word) say yes/aye they do in Sweden
Sometimes I forget just how *old* Greece is
Most of the comments on here are talking about languages going back 500-1000 years, but here you guys are talking about languages 3 times older than that
Makes more sense than 'a shoot'. English sucks
No we don't have one
But our drivers license has kinda become the defacto ID card for people here
We don't really have one although people have been debating one for the last 20 years
The closest I can think of is a young scot card which you can use to get discounts on things as a young person which just has your DOB, face etc but nothing national
Stirling, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Glasgow and Glasgow again
Edinburgh probably was the biggest city in Scotland, until the 19th century when Glasgow began to boom and turned into a massive centre of trade and industry
IIRC Glasgow built half of the world's metal ships at one point, and it was the world capital for Tobacco trade
I wouldn’t have expected Stirling to be on there
1801 (the census year) Edinburgh was still more populous than Glasgow by about 20,000 people (77k to 95k ish)
Thats interesting, wouldn't have expected that
I did six months at a village with a uni near Frankfurt - some of the city boy types hated it, I liked it, and it was a (sometimes delightfully) strange place
It drew a fuck-tonne of Canadians for whatever reason, the uni itself consisted of a castle ruin and despite being in the German countryside, the Wifi was pretty good
Presumably Malta is a good choice if you want an English-speaking university in a Mediterranean climate
Was it Germersheim (University of Mainz) by any chance
Nah, it was EBS
I can usually tell if someone's from the British isles or not but beyond that it can get a bit tricky
I guess Slavic people do have a distinct look to them but I won't be able to tell exactly which country they're from
Something I like to do though is go on ancestrydna and see my dna matches and guess if they're even from Scotland or not and usually I'm right, so it's not as much to do about their genetic ancestry and more to do with I guess how your looks or overall style is shaped by your culture and surroundings
I'm pretty proud that I was even able to guess from a mile away that a guy was English even though he had mostly Scottish ancestry
Exactly there’s too much variation
The most common features in Scotland are brown hair, blue eyes and pale complexion
However there’s also loads of people with ginger hair, blonde hair, dark hair, more tanned skin or brown eyes
all germans are anime characters
If you're not already vegan that's the easiest one that has a huge impact
If you live in a city there might be zero-waste shops near you that let you bring your own packaging to buy food
"we're all jock tamson's bairns"
meaning: we're all born equal
I like "da wird ja der Hund in der Pfanne verrückt" which literally translates to "that makes the dog in the pan go crazy" and is used to show surprise or disbelief
We have Bòrd na Gàidhlig which is for "securing the status of the Gaelic language as an official language of Scotland commanding equal respect to the English language
But its terribly incompetent at its job with terrible funding priorities
some of the ones in the highlands and islands are amazing but absolutely baltic
Yeah, the [Isle of Harris] ) has some beautiful beaches
depends, of late we've been getting scarily warm summers so between 15-30 degrees but the winds are quite cold
But I suppose if your from Finland that'll be not too bad lol
Kyle Falconer and the View deserve more international recognition
Kyles Music with the View or solo is incredible
Peatbog faeries
An amazing blend of electronic music mixed with traditional Scottish stuff
Really worth a listen
Really underrated imo
This is Paolo Nutini
He's the only artist that I listen to when I listen to music, which isn't that much
These are some songs from him that I love (Live versions) [Here] [Here] [Here] [Here]
[oh you know it]
>I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically -- any woman
I was a hitter
I couldn't express myself and I hit
More shoe gaze style, but I also love creature with the atom brain
Saw them at pukkelpop and they were fantastic
A love Gerry but I dunno how well known he is outwith the UK and Ireland
But like I say Kyles leagues above
Glasgow and Edinburgh
Edinburgh is the capital, home of the Scottish government
It's got the national rugby stadium, which is also the biggest stadium in Scotland
Architecturally it's far nicer, the Old and New Towns are UNESCO World Heritage sites and it's near the Forth Bridge, another UNESCO site
Glasgow is the bigger, more populated city
It's been referred to in the past with terms like "Second City of the [British] Empire", "Workshop of the Empire". It's got the national football stadium and the two most popular teams are in Glasgow
99% of the time if a noteworthy band plays in Scotland it'll be in Glasgow
They've got a few things in common: the two main airports, both are quite bit arty centres
I like how Glasgow and Edinburgh each claim it's *not* a rivalry, but can't resist piling in with the usual chippy comments the instant the other city is mentioned
> It is however mostly notable in football, nowadays there isnt thát much of a rivalry
When do you think away fans will be allowed to return to that fixture
That would be absolutely wild
And then there Dundee chilling in rampant unemployment, abuse and one of the highest teenage pregnancy rates in the country
But hey at least they have a multi billion pound museum that looks cool
Half of Glasgow either think it's the capital or will tell foreigners that it is anyway
I wouldn't worry about it, I thought Waltzing Matilda was the Australian national anthem until a couple of years ago
Glasgow is to Scotland what Toronto is to Canada
Not the capital, but still "the city" that everyone thinks of first
I was at a Fortuna Dusseldorf match this time last year and the Fortuna fans were signing "Cologne, Colgone die scheiße vom dom" and there were plenty of anti-Köln stickers in and around the stadium and around the old-town
I then went to an FC Köln game the next day and there was nothing about Dusseldorf
But then again in footballing terms FC Köln's biggest rivals are Borussia Monchengladbach
>Half of Glasgow either think it's the capital or will tell foreigners that it is anyway
Uhhhh what
I have never heard anyone in Glasgow proclaim the city to be the capital
In fact, most people here are fairly happy with Edinburgh being the capital
I'm not entirely sure that's the case
I'm pretty sure Edinburgh is better known abroad because of tourism, the castle, etc
Lol it’s definitely nowhere near that
Edinburgh and Glasgow are probably on par internationally with Edinburgh probably being most widely known if you had to pick one
Glasgow is more dominant domestically because of the larger population and because it is the media centre of Scotland
It’s a banger
I guess, I am wrong about many things lol
I just assumed Glasgow was more famous abroad because 90% of the time when people say "Scottish accent" they refer to Glasgow's accent
That's a fair point, but I wonder how many folk actually know it's a Glasgow accent
I suppose football fans are more likely to be aware of Glasgow too
The German movie *Das Boot* had an ensemble cast speaking various dialects of German, in a wide variety of accents
The movie was dubbed into English by the original cast, and it is clear that they still have varied accents
In the Pixar movie *Brave* a couple of characters were voiced by Kevin McKidd in his native Doric dialect (of the Scots language)
This is pretty much unintelligible to most English speakers
I wonder how it was handled in other language versions
Depends what you mean by dialect - accents, there's hundreds
Distinct dialects with a different vocabulary and grammar
Probably 8/9
Scots and Scottish English, Northern Ireland, Newcastle, Liverpool have their own, Yorkshire too
The Southwest probably counts as distinct, then there's a lot of people in the big cities who count - some very clearly, like the West Indian community, then Bangladeshi, Pakistani, Indian
But they all exist on a sliding scale - not everyone with the associated accent speaks in the dialect, and people might use some aspects (like -dem pluralisation in West Indian patois or the contracted definite article in Yorkshire) without any of the other signifiers
Then there's the huge amount of linguistic borrowing that goes on
One thing that is certain is that people have very strong opinions on the matter
Some will no doubt feel there are waaaay more, but these are the ones that leapt to mind
In scotland the scots “language” has different dialects depending on what part of scotland you’re in e.g. Doric in the north east, south west in the south west, etc
But there is also the debate if scots is a language or a dialect of english which means that if you class scots as a language, it has quite a few dialects and if you don’t class scots as a language then english gains a few more dialects
So yeah, we have a few dialects
Honestly it can feel like a few dialects per 1km
And within Scotland we have Gaelic (entire language, not just a dialect), Doric, Glaswegian, whatever Shetlanders speak, same for Orkney and ... Edinburgh
Not comparable to Hitler, but
The "evil" British Empire taking over the world
In Scotland we fought for centuries to remain independent but got sucked into a union using royals after England couldn't take us by force
We're still trying to get out of it after slowly getting more devolved powers in the last 50 years
We just wanted to be left alone with our warring clans and our sheep and our bagpipes
Ex colonies all have independence from the empire celebrations and we're still stuck being the bad guy because were stuck as a part of the UK
Spanish flu was named I think because Spain did the most work and research on it
Does *anyone* in Europe call them French fries
Scotland has 'Modern Studies', which is a sort of mix of politics, sociology, economics, civics etc
In Scotland we have Country Dancing
From primary 1 every child is taught the traditional dances you'd dance at a traditional Scottish Ceilidh
It usually happens around Christmas time, you paid off boy/girl and start off with the easy dances in primary school
By high school it is expected that you can dance all the dances fairly competently and the high school dances all have a Ceilidh element to them
It comes in handy at fundraisers and weddings
We have home economics compulsory up until we choose our subjects for ourselves at around 13
Mostly just basic knife skills and cooking skills (I already knew how to cook and hated it - I got marks off all the time for adding things I knew would make the bland school recipe taste better) but you could choose it as a subject after and it was more expansive with sewing and stuff and household management
I was so happy that I didn't need to do it anymore
I’m impressed by the level of detail in other countries for Home Economics
In Scotland, we learned how to make beans on toast
We have it, but as far as I can tell there really aren’t very many actual home ec teachers, so a lot of schools substitute it for something similar that another teacher is qualified to run
Yeah, our school actually uses RE to try to dissuade religious discrimination
We learned way more about Islam than any other religion, and the teachers went out of their way to point out all the various stereotypes and harmful beliefs that are either exaggerated by the media or certain political parties, or just flat out not true
On the border between Scotland and England we have a town called Gretna
Famous for young English couples crossing the border to get married without their parents permission
Since it's on the border, it means that driving after drinking a pint is legal in one side of the town but illegal on the other
I've been able to discuss the British Empire with people from various countries, including India, Burma/Myanmar, Kenya, Sri Lanka, the Caribbean Iraq, Malta, Tuvalu, Fiji
Many people have very mixed reactions to the British Empire
On the one hand, they are anti-imperialists, to the extent that they are very glad the British left, and proud of their independence
On the other hand, they also recognise that the British kept order in difficult circumstances, laid the basis for working democratic institutions, established legal and administrative structures, founded educational institutions, and built infrastructure from sewers to railways
They are still glad the British left, but also glad they were colonised by the British and not by someone else
One old guy in Burma/Myanmar told me, 'We used to say that the British Empire was bad, but I was educated at a mission school and they were good to us
The Chinese Empire will be much much worse
One dude in Iraq told me, 'The only time Iraq had justice and order was under the British mandate
A former senior judge in Malta said, 'My first passport was British
We wanted independence but had no animosity
Relations between the British and the Maltese were very good during the war
A member of Parliament in a South Pacific island said, 'When a ship came into the lagoon we would raise the British flag
If they were friendly they would come in and trade with us
If not, they stayed away
No one would threaten us, because we were under protection of the British
Worst year of my life, in fact
I understand Dutch and German to a reasonae degree
English one too
Others I haven't a goddamn clue
I can understand the German page but I think that's only because I can speak German
I hate Dutch, it looks like English drunk and i never know if it's Dutch or I've finally forgotten how to read
it if makes you feel better I also hate English
I struggle to pronoucne R and th sounds
it also NEVER spells how it sounds even though everyone says it does
Joggies and etc aye
The nice old worn clothes for the house, the ones that aren't in a great state useful for dirty jobs that might stain them
'Comf' isn't a prefix though, 'con'/'com' is
Flower of Scotland is pretty anti English
The only one I can think of is flower of Scotland which is Scotland's national anthem, but it doesn't really have any lines I'd say which are "offensive" or anything, it's just about Scotland beating England
It is a pretty good song regardless though, I like the calm tone to it
Aye we have those same songs in certain parts of Scotland, and not only would they offend some other countries but they offend a lot of people here
And on the other side of the spectrum we have songs like "billy boys" and "the sash".
As a neutral party hearing songs about the troubles makes me cringe
Aside from them I can't think of any really
Scotlands national anthem is singing about fighting the English
A few Scotland v England Rugby games the English have complained about it
Here is the start of the song:
O Flower of Scotland,
When will we see
Your like again,
That fought and died for,
Your wee bit Hill and Glen,
And stood against him (against who
Proud Edward’s Army,
And sent him homeward,
To think again
In Scotland a lot of our traditional songs are anti-English
Eg:
•Our unofficial national anthem (O Flower Of Scotland) is about fighting the English
•A lot of traditional songs are from the Jacobite Rebellion - eg "Hey Jonny Cope", "Skye Boat Song", "Charlie is my darling", etc - and therefore are anti-English
I mean flower of Scotland is literally about Scotland beating the English so it all evens out
Not really, the song doesn't mention the English in general, just "Proud Edward's army".
O Flower of Scotland,
When will we see
Your like again,
That fought and died for,
Your wee bit Hill and Glen,
And stood against him (against who
Proud Edward’s Army,
And sent him homeward,
To think again
I find it's much better to sing "*Tae* think again" even if you don't do the rest in Scots
It is a very good song
I would totally support an English national anthem, gives you something different to sing for sport at the least
God Save the Queen can stick around as the British anthem just fine though I think most of us would agree it's a bit boring
I don't think they were suggesting we all sing that
Just the English
We have perfectly serviceable national anthems of our own
> and stood against him
> *'gainst who
> Proud Edwards army
> *'bastards
> And sent them homewards
> Tae think again
It's still not talking about the English in general, even with the add-ons
Just how most Scots sing it after a few too many wee drams
I wish we could use Rule Britannia as it really does instill true pride, shame about all that empiring we did I suppose
[Uhhh]
Oh nothing at all my good friend
CKII:
Used to mostly play as Castille in Spain, partially cause most of my family is from Spain, partially because it used to be a very cushy starting place, you could rapidly expand by assassinating the Galician King and inheriting that Kingdom before pushing into Leon and hence race Navarra and Aragon to conquest the neighbouring Emirates, usually by trying to cut east towards the med as fast as possible so only you neighboured them
Though I think that start has got less simple with the updates
Also liked the various Viking starts
The Western Isles start again a favourite for being close to where I live, and being the forebearer to the Lordship of the Isles, and simply for being a romp to tear down Great Britain and Ireland
HOI4:
I've not played that much, but so far I think I've largely just down Japan, the UK, and Mexico, without too much rhyme or reason
Japan and the UK are fun obviously for the expansionist possibilities, while Mexico was just cause I wanted to get the achievement for reclaiming the old Mexican empire, which was a lot of fun
I thought it would be Székesfehérvár!
I was hoping to take a trip to Plovdiv (Bulgaria) to visit my friend there, see the sights and get better at my Bulgarian
guess I'll have to wait a wee bit longer :(
Not a city but a town
Ayr on the west coast of Scotland
I just love getting the train down for the day and walking down to the beach from the train station
Getting an ice cream on the way and then playing with my son in the park
Really miss that
Edinburgh New Town
The houses the architecture, the people
You just look at pictures of it and you know it was built for, and lived in by wealthy people
Most of the houses have basement flats that were made for staff to live in
Here in a rural scenic part on the west coast of Scotland, I have seen Portuguese, Slovakian and some weird green Norwegian plates which is as foreign as it gets for us
Seen a blacked out Mercedes-Benz on Russian diplomatic plates on the Autoroute du Soleil just outside Paris
Seen a parade of Romanian mazdas - in Stirling city centre
Generally goes:
* Northern Ireland
* Ireland
* Wales
* Anyone playing against England (Come on you Croats
We need to qualify for international tournaments first before we can do that
For football, In the likely event that Scotland doesn't qualify I usually pick another team to back
Usually France or Germany but after their last World Cup performance I am going to back Croatia next time
For Rugby I'd back Ireland in lieu of Scotland
Whoever is playing England lol
I generally go for Germany
Also whoever's playing England, and whoever's playing Ireland
Im Scottish btw
Same
Also cheer on Sweden cos my grandfather was Swedish
> I hope Scotland don’t qualify for Euro 2020
Mate don’t need to hope for something we both know won’t happen
You didn't put England out
Simple as that
We appreciate all the alliances but we have to follow the results on this one, sorry friend
Having lived in several European countries, what surprised me was the extent to which doing things across borders is, even within the EU, still surprisingly difficult
Stuff like trying to get a doctor's appointment in one EU country when your mobile phone is from another (just moved, no local sim yet; foreign number completely confused medical receptionist), or trying to get official documents from one EU country to be accepted by another (even though this should happen)
Trying to get insurance on a house you rent out in one EU country when your address is in a different EU country
All that kind of thing
Most of it was do-able, in the end, but none of it was easy or straightforward
Scotland isn't a monolith - Glaswegians tend to be a lot more chatty than folk from the east coast cities, in general
londoners be like
England is an odd place - places with 80,000 people can still have a very "rural" mindset
Especially when it can be summed up with one word most of the time: shite
They are very interesting
There's a book written by two British chaps in the 1950s who visited Andorra, San Marino, Liechtenstein and Monaco
I can't remember the name of the book or the authors, sadly,  but it really sparked my interest in micro states
San Marino is particularly interesting: the last in the line of Italian city-republics
A constitutional relic of medieval democracy
Two 'captains-regent'. Very cool
I'm not sure whether Malta counts as a micro-state - perhaps a 'mini-state'? - but it's one of my favourite countries
I've visited several times, including doing some of my PhD field research there
Iran/Syria/Iraq, none of these countries are the enemy
Iran hasn't declared war on any country since its inception, the USA has given munitions to Saddam to kill Iranians
They have shot down civilian aircraft and refused to apologise and have openly said that Iran is part of the "Axis of Evil
" No wonder Iranians feel so hostile to the USA, of course because of this they are going to work to push their interests through proxies across the middle east to prevent a brutal attack like the Iran-Iraq war from a state which would be sympathetic to the USA
If Iran killed the V.P or any other high ranking official inside the USA the USA would have declared war pretty quickly
Its a crazy thing to do and as Mossad realised they could kill these people like Soleimani or the Ayatollah but there isn't much point
All it does is aggravate tensions and hostility towards the west and create a power vaccum which would likely be filled by Islamic terror (as seen in Libya/Iraq/Afghanistan, who have suffered terribly
It's even weirder as although people say he was a crazy terrorist most of his work was against Daesh and Al-Qaeda
Although Iran is no model country by any means its nothing that the USA and CTJF-OIR wasn't doing
He was just doing it with support of Shia militias to protect against Sunni militias
As far as I have read I am yet to read of any warcrimes in Iraq or Syria that would make him worthy of a drone strike apart from the obvious power play by the USA
On the whole it seems a very silly imperialistic thing to do which will destabilise and hurt relations with the Iran even more
I am interested to see what Iran will do next
However I think talk of a third world war is inherently unlikely, although it depends on how fast Iran can enrich its uranium to create nuclear weapons which I'm sure they will increase the production dramatically
This is between the US and Iran
The whole region is a nest of vipers that the west doesn't understand and doesn't *want* to understand
Successive western interventions have only made things worse
Time to cut loose, and redirect military sending on the region into humanitarian spending to help the innocent caught up in this mess
Not as bad as Instagram comments, some of them were horrendous
>Would serbia react with an assassination
Now why did an Austrian pick Serbia of all countries for this example
About 25% of Iraq is Sunni, Sunni Muslims (Saudi/Egypt/Pakistan) are massively at odds with Shia Muslims (Iran) and will always support the Sunni Muslim side in the geopolitical argument
So yes they will be happy
However as seen with the recent elections in 2018 (where the 3 biggest parties were Shia) and the fact that 70% of Iraq is Shia they are more likely to be sympathic to Iran
So although some Iraqis will be happy most will not be
That would be incorrect too, given the Iranian seizure of a European\* tanker in the Strait of Hormuz
\**Stena Impero -* British flagged, owned by a Swedish shipping line with a multinational crew
The ship was targeted in a specifically anti-British move, but that doesn't mean that consequences won't be felt in broader European circles
As I said they are more likely to be pro Iranian
This is all a mess of Trump's making, also love that username mate
That is true, but doesn't negate the point that Iran does operate against Europe
Whether they would operate against Europe if Europe left them alone is a different question, but one that anyone forming future policy with regards to Iran should be thinking through very carefully
The English
The English again
The Irish do occasionally semi accidentally invade our territorial waters though, got a bit heated a couple months back
England
England's only past time is invading
England
As if it's the first time
Germany
Third time's the charm
Don’t even fecking think about it
We will set you on fire and boot you in the nuts
The English
England
England if we ask for another independence referendum
It's always the English
Invaded England failing to invade Germany/France
We have only one land border and the neighbours to the south have a history of crossing it
Just along the coast from here, a town still celebrates the [Battle of Largs in 1263] where we saw off an invasion attempt by some Norwegian Vikings
There's monuments, a Viking museum, a massive metal Viking on the sea front, and a yearly Viking festival with a re-enactment of the battle
Which is hilarious
Oof sorry dude
Doesn't help that I games where I can play as Scotland I always Invade England
> The day we all hear bagpipes playing from the north we know we’ve gone fucked up
It's probably not a military invasion - they're just buskers coming to take over the tube
Which, thinking about it, might be worse
We appreciate the specificity
England
Will you stop embarrassing us in public
Nice to see you stepping up and being honest about the past there brother, that's the first step to recovery
Uh oh
It was mate, you used the phrase correctly and in its common usage
Make that a happy face
No, but I wish we did
Those are similar dishes sure but they're not the same
Toasties are specifically made in a Breville or Breville style machine, so they're more like pockets than a sandwich and a croque ~~monster~~ monsieur isn't just cheese, it's bechamel/mornay sauce and ham
It's not really a  different *language*, but [ye cannae shove yer granny aff the bus] is a pretty catchy kids song imo
Dj fucking bad boy [Friday Nite]
That song only sounds right coming from the back of a bus played from a phone
I haven't even read the French version and I'll hear nothing against it just because Voldemort's middle name is Elvis
In Primary we had trays to put stuff in like our snack and pencil cases and all actual school things like jotters and books and stuff were kept by the school
In secondary we had lockers but not everyone got them and if you wanted to have one you'd have to give the school a pound to get one
Alot of people didnt get one as it cost money and teachers would let you leave stuff like jackets and sports kits in their rooms while you went to other classes
In our school we had a few lockers, but they were reserved for older students (15 to 18 year olds) and you had to put a deposit down you got when you gave up the locker/left school
No lockers in primary but my high school had them for s1 to s5 and in s6 folk just cut about with their bags on their backs
only for S5/6s (last two years of school) but there's not enough for everyone so it's first come first served
We did but only for certain years
So for our secondary it was pupils in first and second year who were allowed them as they were seen as more likely to be disorganised
But they were in a terrible place in the corner of campus which was more hassle than it was worth and I just found it too much of a pain to go back and forth after lessons or before going home
So they were seldom used
My high school in Scotland only had lockers for S5-S6 (last 2 years of high school)
Yes, the Edinburgh vaults are thought to be one of the most haunted locations in the world (if you believe in such things)
They were built
under Edinburghs South Bridge originally as storerooms for businesses in the 17th century, but were quickly filled with the poor and disreputable people
It witnessed murders, kidnappings and all the other grizzly stuff
Very spooky
dDrrRUgGSss
It’s an island
Are national animal is a unicorn
Do i even need to say
i mean we have other nice things
The illegal kind
I think the main difference is that in the UK as well as other countries the bus exit is normally next to the drivers console in the front meaning you naturally walk past them when you get off the bus
Whereas in Europe its more likely to be in the middle which makes it much hard to say thanks
Yea it is
Everyone that leaves the bus passes the driver and thanks them
Ive noticed the same when leaving a plane, we all thank the staff
Yep, always thank the driver and if you don't you're a wanker
Takes 2 seconds, showing gratityde to working class heroes
It's nae England, that's all
I love that the Scotland-England border follows the sereval hundred million year old split from when Great Britain was 2 islands
We've got a funky pointy hat (if you were to ignore our rather large number of islands)
&#x200B;
Others I enjoy include Iceland looking like an odd fish, India with its bottom spike and Russia because **chonk**
I always look at norway and finland or sweden and finland as a big ol penis
Or all together for a penis split at the tip
On the west coast of Scotland there is a penis and ball at Campbeltown
Hey what the actual fuck, you told us Scotland  was special and now this
Both you and Finland used to come visit us, now you're eyeing up Poland
Now I just feel used
You said that's what you liked about us
you know what just you go we'll be fine, we can find someone else to rape us easily you know
I knew it, you were thinking about England the entire time
You're just like the French
Well I have news for you we were thinking about Ireland
Oh nothing wrong with the French apart from like you they can't get over the English
We get it they had a thing for 100 years moe on
Well that's true we did entertain you
The Danish were right about you
Fine then, it's not like I enjoyed it anyway
and yes Finland was better
I'm not at all surprised but it's just abhorrent
I think the UK should try and kick Turkey out of NATO but I don't know if that's possible, it certainly isn't likely though
Trumps decision on this was a disgusting betrayal of an already oppressed people who need all the help they can get and they bloody deserve it for what they have sacrificed
Not that they should be abandoned regardless
Such a shit situation
Kurds deserve their own country
Full stop
Sturgeon must condemn
Fuck Erdogan man, what an absolute piece of shit
So will we give yous back to the Russians then
Given that Estonians having their own country took pieces out of them
Or would you prefer the Swedes
Yup
Some people can become indistinguishable for the most part, maybe with the occasionally lilt
My mother's Spanish, most people locally seem to forget that she is and tourists often think she's a native of this Scottish village because her accent doesn't usually reveal it
And I've met young non-native speakers from Spain, Greece, Germany, Pakistan who had accents that were either subtle and didn't draw much attention (in a similar way to say, Highland accents, there is some tinge but often not enough for people not familiar with it to place) or they can have a surprisingly faithful regional accent (met a few with quite convincing Northern or Glasweigin accents because those are the people they met and spoke with most often)
It's a lot more difficult to place a lot of non-natives that I think people give credit, especially given the large number of English accents they can fall  into for defence
Honestly, the easiest ones to spot are usually those determined to shoot for RP instead of a more natural accent
People also probably just don't notice the ones who pass because, you know, they pass and aren't obvious
To a non-native speaker I can totally understand where they're coming from so I'm pleasantly surprised when a non-native speaker can pick me out as Scottish
Norwegians and Icelanders seem to be particularly good at it
French Canadians on the other hand seem to struggle to place my accent though
The thing is, English is so broken that these spellings are still surprisingly legible to native speakers like myself
That's fair enough, especially if you aren't constantly surrounded by English speech like those living in English speaking countries
That said, the whole accent thing is obviously not super important in English anyway since there isn't a singular 'correct' accent, so even if you speak quickly and have a little Italian lilt or cadence, doesn't matter so long as the other party understands
I sometimes feel like we don't make that clear enough, sadly, and some people pursue a 'perfect' accent that doesn't exist (usually RP, which
isn't an accent well liked by a lot of Scots and Northerners) when honestly you just need to be understandable
Hell, quite often a little bit of a different accent helps and sounds a lot more genuine and sincere than RP
But now I'm rambling, lol
What if my Irish friend and I were both speaking standard English
I imagine that would be an absolute shitemare to tell apart then
Ha, I've always found our accents to sound more "jaggy" than "curly" but there you go
I can pick out some Canadian accents from Americans but not all (Newfoundland is cheating obviously
do you know what juropijan means
I thought that was the subreddit at play in the title but I really can't figure out what juropijan can be
edit: just realised it might be european, where the hell are people saying european like juropijan
Ah, I was meaning using standard English words and actually enunciating my Ts
My attempts at English and American accents are very poor to say the least
I've actually heard most of these
I find it quite funny how Dutch people tend to translate their Euphemisms and phrases into English
I know, It's great
I sometimes hear people speaking Dutch and shoving English words in or vice versa
I've heard there are some problems in Dutch schools with classes taught in poor English though
I honestly think you're doing a disservice to your kids by trying to keep an "adults only language" lol
If my parents were bilingual or trilingual and hid a language from me instead of teaching me when my brain was still a sponge I'd be quite annoyed with them
There are lots of people from rural America who are barely literate so it wouldn't surprise me that the average Dutch person has better English skills than the average yank
Universal English is quite an interesting concept but I have to admit that it hurts a little to hear continental Europeans trying to speak English with an American accent
That makes sense actually, might be a good way of doing it if/when I decide to learn a foreign language myself
(if I ever decide I want kids
I actually started Polish on Duolingo a little while ago so I'm planning on starting that up again, was using music to help there as I had a hard time finding Polish TV shows and movies with good actors and directors
I've actually heard of dark, and I've heard lots of good things about it
If I wasn't planning on moving to Poland at some point I would probably be learning Dutch
As with every other country, we share a lot in common with our neighbours
Our national celebration being about a poet rather than a revolution or battle is pretty unique though
My brain
wtf Denmark
A brilliant idea and I'm super happy we adopted it, great job Finland
I'd have said the GAA is Ireland's most unique feature
Fuck the gays right, Poland
Source: I'm queer and would like to fuck some gays
Yup
I mean, look at all the stuff we invented
Burn's Night
we also threw in a bit of base 20
Ever heard "Four score and seven years ago

And proud of it

I've always found French people to be quite politically minded which I've always admired, you certainly don't always see that here
The steam engine, penicillin, the rubber tyre

Now what does my flair say
Horses have more teeth
Don't forget [James Maxwell] who took the first colour photograph and brought about The Second Great Unification in Physics through theory of electromagnetic radiation
Got a link
Interested to see \^.^
Aye, usually depends on if you're in Govanhill or Milngavie though
At the moment Gerry Cinnamon is pretty popular so something like Belter or Canter, maybe
If we’re talking Scottish Gaelic Runrig pretty much have everyone beat
Proclaimers 500 miles, every Scottish cunt hates it but for some reason we are still forced to listen to it
Aye they did but there’s really nobody who can replace them
That being said Skipinnish are apparently well popular with the teuchters, though don’t know if they sing in Gaelic cos am no a teuchter
Glasgow - other Scottish people struggle to understand them because of their thick accent
They also talk really quick and aggressively
Aberdeen because they shag sheep
Orkney and Shetland
They feel much closer to Norway than Scotland
probably shetland and the other islands, they seem to be forgotten about sometimes
Scotland is probably divided into 3-5 very distinct regions with two good candidates for the odd one out
Either the north east around Aberdeen where Scots is spoken to a significant degree and they have a whole bunch of oil money or the Western Islands which are very christian, still engage in a bit of subsistence agriculture and Gaelic is spoken to a significant degree
Shetland; they live in a box
Let me guess are you fae Glasgow or Edinburgh
I think part of what makes it weird is that the population of London is a couple million more than Scotland, so it really does just become it's own dominant entity in the UK
Glaswegians don't really talk Scots
It's very different to English dialects, but it's also very different to other dialects in Scotland
I'm from the north east, and I can often understand Ayrshire and D+G folk better than weegies, despite having to go past Glasgow to get to Ayrshire and the South West from Aberdeen
Just come back from York and they lot were much easier to understand than Glaswegians
They have this tendency to exaggerate their accents around non-Scottish people too, desperate to be misunderstood so they can complain about it
I live only half an hour from Glasgow and no one outside of their city speaks remotely like them, it's so strange
Edinburgh, where bout are you lad
We would, bit the Tory twats down south want their oil
Yeah, the thick accents of Glasgow and to a lesser extent Dundee are something of an anomaly
Also really annoying to have people come to the Highlands and moan we don't sound 'Scottish'. Aye, we don't sound lime your stereotypical Weegie up here, funny that
Glasgow is also a wee bit funny (sad funny) with the whole sectarianism in football
It's a weird city
Aberdeeenshire
A real teuchter
Tbf I go to uni in Edinburgh and you could easily have been describing my experience
yikes
If a majority of people in Orkney and Shetland want it, then yes
What's more important, democracy or profit
Having stayed in Edinburgh for uni, I also find it weird the (primarily Glasweigin) claims that Edinburgh doesn't have a Scottish accemt but a posh, essentially English accent
Which seems to be entirely based on setting Glasgow as the norm
It's weird and stupid
This is based on them thinking everyone in Edinburgh is posh
Working class Edinburgh accents don’t sound English at all
Alright then, they don't leave
Democracy
Theres pretty much no awful mainstream music coming out of Scotland just now
Im sure if you look at the unknown theres some pish but the big acts are all at the very least tolerable
Looking more widely at Britain however; Ed Sheeran and Sam Smith are shite of the highest order
I hate the word Chav so much man
Be the Holy Roman Emperor one, so I think likely, the HRE did like reasserting control of Italy
Gotta love a bit of Flower of Scotland
Flower of Scotland is just about beating the English
I like it
Bagpipes are never getting old
I like ours but I'm not sure if it's an official "national anthem" or just something we sing at rugby
[O' Flower of Scotland] is decent if a little slow paced
Scotland the Brave is way better though
[Here] is the lyrical version and [here] is the bagpipe version
Funeral dirge is about right
I've never liked GSTQ and not just because of the fact it sounds boring
It'd be nice to have an anthem that talks up the country or the people (like a lot of others do) rather than showing deference to an individual
I do like Flower of Scotland but surprisingly I've seen folk calling that a dirge as well
It's quite something hearing it at Murrayfield, especially when the music cuts out for the second verse
Love hearing it during the 6 Nations Rugby
Northern Ireland should have "We're not brazil we're nothern Ireland" haha
Or just select  a random Queen song every year and cycle through then as anthems
Just to cause maximum confusion
Tbh, I kinda like that Spain has no lyrics for the anthem
Seems more inclusive than lyrics, which sort of funnel you towards some idea, while a lyricless anthem opens it up
It at least stops the squabbles that surround every other anthem
We have it in Austria and the UK too
Another one that is really widespread in CH and A is Schwedentropfen or Schwedenbitter (herbal remedy)
I think it's popular in southern Germany as well
Is this actually a thing or is it like one of those Gaelic words or phrases made up to annoy learners
Neither does Gaelic but they're still known to be a big mischievous
Mixing the very formal and the informal
"Sir please may I have a carton of fags and these bevvies
" sort of thing
&#x200B;
Quite a lot of people get the word order mixed up in a whole number of ways too
Often when dealing with Indian colleagues at work they will ask me to "kindly do the needful" which is something we would never say here in the UK
I remember in German class when my German teacher told us the German for mobile phone was a "handy" me and my friend and then others burst out laughing and then others when they realised what we were laughing at
It was typical teenage immaturity but here in Scotland a handy is a slang term for a hand job so I would be very apprehensive about mixing up the terms
Whom has a purpose when using more formal English especially when writing a letter but yeah if you use it down the local pub you look like a bampot
Incredibly formal and I can honestly say the only time I ever use it is in formal letter writing: "To whom it may concern".
Even then it seems overly formal and awkward but I prefer it to some alternatives
I'm pretty guilty of this tbh from living in the US for a bit and spending a little too much time on the internet I've screwed up my speech a bit
Imagine a slightly Irishy Scottish accent saying Americanisms
It's a way of asking you to action something, it comes across a bit condescending and passive aggressive alot of the time
I understand its not meant like that and used to it now
So doesn't get my back up anymore
It is not uncivilised
Some commentators are comparing it to Ukraine, but that's very inaccurate
We have rules and standards and will uphold and enforce them
Brawling is unheard of
But what we do have is a very robust, cut-n-thrust, adversarial style of debating
The booing, shouting, heckling etc rarely gets out of hand
What you are watching is not chaos, it is a highly scripted, traditional, formulaic type of adversarial exchange
If you want an analogy, it is closer to fencing than to a street brawl
They are fighting, and it can be vicious, but it is an organised type of fighting
It's embarrassing as fuck
Have sex, make love
Polish isn't a romance language, but it's very romantic
You cultivate it, like roses in a garden
Lovely
I would say that "fare" is better translated as "do"
do sex
do love
So what you are really saying is that you like to plow (plough) your furrows
Got it
In Scotland we have the 'tartan noir' for the crime/dark stuff
Same root as most of the other folks using black for that
In journalism, the 'red tops' are the gossipy/trashy papers, because of the colour of their mastheads
'blue' means a bit ruder
No idea where that comes from
We had something similar to your "Bird" languag where I grew up in Scotland
It was called "gibberish", or in the actual language of gibberish it was called "Juruguberegeririgish" (the only "irregular" word in the language, interestingly)
Unlike egg language and pig latin it had *a lot* more syllables, and like all these kid languages kids could pick it up in a matter of minutes from one another, but adults never seemed to manage to, even when it was explained to them
It's a bit like this:
"Rule 7
No low effort questions
At all
"R*^(urrug)*ule S*^(erreg)*ev*^(erreg)*en
N^(orrog)o l^(orrog)o e^(rrege)ff^(orrog)ort q^(uerreg)esti^(orrogo)ns
^(Arrag)at ^(Orrog)oll"
After a while we could speaking it shockingly fast and it came in so useful avoiding others hearing our conversations unless they were peers and or paying attention
That would have been shocking to behold
Our teachers never mastered ours, even though they tried to ban it and then get us to teach them how it worked hah
Where else would you store a sewing kit
Would be nice if Scotland never tried colonialism as it drew us into the UK when the colony failed
I don't know much at all about history in general so I'm fairly limited, but I'd say the independence vote in 2014
One of the arguments against independence was the fact that we'd be pulled out of the EU but that's happening anyway, so why not
Probably find a way to avoid the Highland Clearances
There would be a much bigger Gaelic population and native speakers aswell as maybe having a bigger population as a whole
Would've been nice if the Darien scheme wasn't a total failure
All of our wars with England, yes I like the rivalry but King Edward (I, II), just leave us alone
I notice you switch between England, GB and the UK in your comment
But this is hundreds of years before either of the latter two existed as political concepts
Would the UK even exist
Would the UK exist as an entity if this had happened
I think we do, I was concious I got into more pavement and corridor bother after coming back from the states than before I went
It's not like a concrete rule or anything though there are all sorts of reasons why you would walk on the other side
We do, in schools anyway
I naturally walk on the right having been taught to do so on roads (so you can see oncoming traffic and jump out the way if need be) and growing up in a rural enough area that I've spent a significant amount of time walking on country roads
It always irks me when people implement walk on the left rules for this reason (escalators are a different thing, I get why it's stand on the right for them)
Surprised me, never was a thing in my school but a lot of others agree with you
Apparently mine opted for sheer open anarchy instead
Malta, Ireland and the various Crown Dependencies also go the same side
Not sure if Iceland does, beong the other independent European island nation
Most annoying is one person walking dead center of a thin part of pavement, arms thrust out to the side as if they hope the next gust of wind will make them airborne
I just want to get past you you git, stop jumping back to the middle of the pavement, you ambling overgrown penguin and let me overtake
to be fair the schooling system is different in scotland than it is in england
Aye, but I saw a Scot say it as well
That said, my school was rural, so might explain
Little need when their schools are likely same population as the biggest vilage here
Border reivers
A collection of rebellious families in the border regions that resented both English and Scots authority, and lived by cattle theft, playing one side off against the other and the odd bit of mercenary fighting
Queen Elizabeth 1 said "with ten thousand such men, James VI could shake any throne in Europe
" Which is pretty high praise of any army
Assuming, of course, he could bend them to his will and get them all to fight on the same side
"Oh the Norrlänningar and the Sami should be friends
From the musical 'Norrbotten
', in an alternative universe where Rodgers and Hammerstein's ancestors, instead of emigrating to the United States, went to Sweden instead

The only mandatory pricing law that comes to mind is minimum unit pricing for alcohol
Any alcohol sold must cost at least £0
50 per unit, so a standard 70cl bottle of vodka must be at least £13
13 and 1l is I think £18
It was more aimed at high-strength cider which teenagers used to drink at the park because it was so cheap
For a few years now we have had minimum unit pricing on alcohol in Scotland, which means if you're buying alcohol it has to cost at least 50p per unit
White lightning was the way to go tbf
We don't get taught about it too much despite it having been pivotal to WWII and the Cold War, which are covered in school history
For those who know about it, most view it as the unescapable consequence of the geopolitical game that every major power had been playing at the time and would continue to play after the war - as usual, much to the detriment of ordinary people
I know Churchill "betrayed" Poland during the conference but I genuinely believe after the Warsaw uprising failed there was nothing he could do
Curious as to your thoughts on how Poland could have come out of the conference independent or not as a soviet puppet
Doing so would likely have met compromises elsewhere as possibly Greece or Italy may have gone to the Eastern bloc to accommodate for this loss of territory
The Yalta conference is also not taught here at all in the curriculum
I don't think the average person would know much about it apart from it was a peace conference where post WW2 boundaries were drawn up in the Crimea
I think the fall of Czechoslovakia at the time was more to do with the failure of Edvard Beneš to counter act the soft coup of Klement Gottwald
I don't think our coverage of WW2 went into this level of detail
The only reason I've even heard of the Yalta conference (and the others) is because it's a subject of interest to me and I've read countless books on the subject
Your average punter in the street won't know what the hell the Yalta Conference is, never mind have an opinion on it
Pace of life that you see in places like Spain and Italy

Whisky, without the 'e'.
Some of our whiskies are very smoky - there are whiskies produced on the Scottish islands which still use peat within the malting process, giving this flavour
The smoky whiskies are much more of an acquired taste I would say, the non-smoky ones are easier to drink
Whisky, or as Americans call it "Scotch". It depends on what casks they're matured in, but they usually taste like heaven
Whisky hands down
How does it taste
I don’t know how to describe
But I love it
For Scotland, obviously Whisky is top
Got a good distillery in my town, and I do like it sometimes, but not a huge drinker
After that, there has been a huge boom in both Beer breweries and Gin distilleries
Personally I like Gin but do think it is a bit of a scam, basically put in industrial alcohol and a few berries, with some fancy branding and then sell it for £40 a bottle
The Gin industry has gone so crazy, I can imagine the Gin bubble May burst at some point
Rum is now also on the up
People love alcohol :)
I find people see smokier whiskies as more prestigious but the smoother whiskies are much easier to drink and much more flavourful I find
Bunnahbhan 12 and Deanston Virgin Oak are the nicer ones in my opinion, smooth with vanilla hints
I fucking *love* Beirão. It's even fun to say
In simple terms, 'whisky' is the Scottish spelling whereas 'whiskey' is the Irish spelling
Also worth noting that they aren't the same obviously - just like not all Scottish whiskies are the same
>When you say they "still" use peat, it sounds like it's out of necessity
Because it is out of necessity; the use of peat is absolutely necessary because that's the way they have always produced it, in order to give it the same flavour that it has always had traditionally
Not a chance, the -ão is impossible
But I will always try hahaha
No, I agree with you
But when I said that they *still* use peat I wasn't referring to a lack of alternative methods, but that they continued to use peat in the process in order to follow tradition and maintain its flavour
Whereas many Lowland and Speyside whiskies converted from peat to coke
Ah yes, the false friends, have a mate working in a German speaking country and she keeps meeting Germans using works like that thinking they are English
There's one for projector which I have completely forgotten already because it was so unintuitive
'Beamer' or something
I remember it made me think of car headlamps, anyway
It also works both ways, 'trinkt' keeps tripping me up, it's 'to drink' or something, but naturally I keep instinctively thinking 'drinked'.
Don't mind the accent, mate
It's not like we have a proper one, a few dozen on this island alone before you even talk about Ireland, North America, Australasia, Malta
not like most English speakers give a damn about accents anyway, so long as you can be understood
Not a European language, but one of the hardest parts of reading Korean is Konglish - English words written in Korea , which are 'forced' to use Korean phonetics, and I then have to work out what English word they correspond to, e.g. 트럭 'teu-rok' is truck, 화이팅 'hwa-ee-ting' is fighting (used as an encouragement)
When people say this it's like "calling captain obvious

Not my language as I'm not a native Gaelic speaker but one that stands out is Fort William - *An Gearasdan* ("The Garrison")
A lot of the time Gaelic and English place names are fairly similar but this one is particularly different
It also seems to particularly bother the anti-Gaelic roadsign mob so that's a plus
We used to say Peking but changed to saying Beijing a while back

We pronounce it Bay - jing where the j is quite soft (a voiced version of sh I think)
So as you say quite removed from the Chinese pronunciation
Personally use MAPS

If I'm talking to somebody from within the UK, I'll say I'm from Scotland but talking to any foreign people then I'm from the UK
I know a guy who's little sister is Chinese, grew up in Scotland any time someone asked her were she was from she would say Scotland
If they said yeah but were are you really from she would say "paisely is still part of Scotland fucking bawbag" if it was was someone from the east coast of Scotland talking to her they would say she was from Glasgow then and the response can only be described as *angry paisely noises*
When someone needs to refer England and Wales together (it happens quite a lot in legislation), the term is England and Wales
Britain is often used as shorthand for Great Britain

No thanks : ) i like free healthcare and paid holidays way too much
A lot of people have mentioned other reasons that I agree with so I’ll give my specific reason
I’m a teacher, the salary i’d get in the states might be slightly better but on average it’s the basically the same
But my contract would be far more insecure
Teachers are often on yearly review, and can be let go on a whim
By comparison, I got a permanent contract after 1 year and that’s not unusual - the unions here would go apeshit if they thought schools were using 1 year contracts as probation
I’d also have much larger classes to deal with; legally mine are capped at 20, American teachers have to contend with twice that number (if not more)
Combined with longer hours (seriously, starting at 7am
), and the sheer amount of marking and assessment they need to do
Then there’s the usual cost of living; i make a good wage here
You see a lot of teachers (not just in expensive areas) complaining that they are making peanuts or have to work over the summer to pay bills
More work, less job security, less financial security
No thanks
For the sake of national healthcare, decent short and long distance public transport,  a well respected leader and a school system without a fear of assault rifles, I'll stick to visiting

Well I can think of a poet from Scotland but not a poem, the poet is Robert Burns
Not very

I see foxes all the time and also have seen deer running behind my house
Seen a stoat once when I was having dinner in a restaurant with my wife and had no idea what it was so had to google it
Foxes are the only ones I see regularly, but they're practically urban animals these days
Deer sometimes wander in to the outer suburbs of cities
Can confirm
I grew up in the countryside of the south west (right next to Exmoor in Devon)
Would always have cows, sheep, horse etc, that have got out of their fields and just gone for a little stroll
One time there was a cow swimming in the harbour, just chilling and cooling off  It was a tough place to live due to low average wage and high living costs, but I miss it there a lot
Great sceanic place
Not great due to the human rights abuse in the country there's only one good thing about it and that a woman actually designed one of the stadiums that is being built for it but even that feels hollow because of their human rights record

I think we're at a cultural point in the west where we're emphasising exoticism in our cuisine (again), it'll shift back again soon
I don't really think there's anything particularly more or less complex about traditional British cooking than traditional Italian cooking, it just doesn't fit into the cultural norm so well
Just looking for different things in their meals
North has heartier, filling winter meals, they have different kinds of meals and favour them

That said, overfishing definitely was an issue in parts of the UK
Iirc, my villages economy and quite a few others got badly hurt by overfishing export fish like herring
Not discounting your criticism of the other comment, especially since overfishing tended to be basically our version of a cash crop for export, limiting its use locally
'An Ìmpireachd Naomh na Ròimhe' in Gàidhlig

> 19 years old married and having kids
High school sweethearts is another peculiarly American thing
I know 1 person under 60 that married their high school boyfriend/girlfriend
It just does not happen here
But you constantly see Americans talk about their husbands/wives and how they’ve been dating since HS
Wonder if it’s because of the whole “no sex before marriage” puritanical attitude
You get married super young because you want to get it on and that’s the only way you’re ‘allowed’.
I'd like to think most Americans also find r/relationships culturally alienating
Mainly because it's full of complete zoomers
Yeah; it pops up in the relationship subs pretty frequently, it’s a common trope in American TV, etc
You don’t see the same trope in the UK - even when people did marry someone they knew in high school (which is really rare) it’s never referred to in those terms
Jesus
This person sounds like she’s never stepped foot outside of the US before
Does she not know that the UK (especially London and the southern areas of the country) is incredibly diverse

Edinburgh: beauty and castle
Glasgow: drugs
Aberdeen: oil
Dundee: Weird boat art gallery thing
Edinburgh: Scotland’s capital, architecture, history, posh people, students, fringe festival, Hogmanay, Scottish Parliament
Glasgow: rough, working class, post industrial, modern and dynamic, strong accent, big population
Aberdeen: buildings all made of granite, oil wealth, ferry links to Shetland and Orkney
Dundee: up and coming with the new V&A museum, computer game design, universities, post industrial
Inverness: gateway to the highlands of Scotland, backpackers and tourists
Ah c’mon, Glasgow’s got more going for it than drugs these days
How do Finnish people feel about Swedish speaking fins
I’m guessing The Netherlands
Pretty much everywhere in Scotland is SNP, not just Glasgow
Glasgow is actually known as the drugs Capital of Europe
It's the 4th largest city in Scotland, pop about 150k (tiny in US terms I know)
You're not missing much tbh
Dundee is famous for Jute Jam and journalism since back in the Victorian days it was the Jute Production capital of the probably the whole world
It also had a huge jam sector or as Americans call it Jelly, Dundee is where Orange jam or marmalade was invent as well
And how could we forget journalism, Dundee at the time was a huge Whaling city so ships were built to withstand the ice of the artic
When the UK decided to explore Antarctica Dundee was the place that built the Ship ‘RRS discovery’  (royal research ship)
In fact NASA names the Discovery space shuttle after the ship
Dundee is also the Birthplace of the company Rockstar and is where Grand Theft Auto was invented, Dundee also is home to the company 4J Studios that is responsible for all the Minecraft console updates
Lemmings was also created in Dundee and has a statue dedicated to it
Nah, no implication
It’s just a strong accent
Now now, no need for that
Edinburgh and Glasgow always get compared but it’s silly because they’re very different cities with different attributes
Oh that’s interesting
I presumed there might be some animosity but didn’t realise there were political differences
Why do they tend to be wealthier
Look at the way the different counties vote, almost all are SNP
It’s still the majority even if not over 50% of the population votes one way, it’s still a majority since no other party got even close to what the SNP did
Read it
It just says cocaine capital
Europe
Haha yes they do speak very quickly as well
There was a reality series here called The Scheme years ago about really rough people on an estate outside of Glasgow
When they showed it in England they had to subtitle it
Haha
Oooooh
Ok, that’s helpful thanks
A bit like Anglo Irish people
More people in Scotland still voted for SNP than any other party, and the SNP hold 80 odd percent of the seats, which is no small amount
Probably political stagnation, some central-western EU countries will try and for a united country but the South and East will likely tell them to calm down
Scotland will join
Hello I would like to join please
Yeah leave a light on for us
We will be coming home soon
I can't really see unifying into one state really working tbh
I mean, even the smaller member states have several regions trying to break away from them due to cultural, political and social reasons, I find it very optimistic to believe that a truly unified EU would survive the test of time and not rip itself apart with such wildly different cultures, politics and not even a unifying language or religion
There isn't really anything there to make you feel like you are connected to a citizen from elsewhere, that you share the same country
And I say that as someone who likes the EU, wants it to succeed, but unifying, trying to become some large nation like Russia, China or the US will kill it
Hell, large continental nations aren't exactly brilliant entities to begin with
A more loose collection as is the case now seems the best way for the EU to survive
I'm not even totally convinced of that, sadly
It would require every part to possess and keep trust, which can evaporate, especially when it inevitable some parts are going to do something the rest disapproves of
Especially when the union is already prone to accusations of being dominated by Germany and to a lesser degree France, whatever federal system exists above the different nations is likely to cause divisions
I really don't see it unless people start identifying as European first instead of their own nations nationality
As it stands, it does not look like the necessary connections are there to allow it to survive, especially as integrating as far as we have already spawned a wave of far-right politics to hit EU member states
>Yet all of them want to stay in the EU
For now
If the new master becomes like the old, it isn't difficult to imagine how they will react
A supranational organisation and another large state/empire spanning to continent are very different beasts, and unification may cause more cracks than it solves
Easier living in a central power house than a peripheral nation to believe everyone will be happy
The centre always believes the periphery will follow
I'm all for linguistic diversity, at no point did I say it should go away
I was pointing out that it does run counter to unifying peoples, as shared language is a major boost for creating a sense of shared nationhood
On the flipside, differing languages, even when they aren't really used, are so often symbols of difference and a banner under which nationalisms rally: the Irish used and use the Irish language to differentiate themselves from their former colonising neighbours, the Scottish Gaelic is increasingly associated with Scottish nationalism
Basques, Catalans, etc, language is part of what defines peoples and their borders and often aids in nationalist urges to seperate from other cultures
Lack of shared language is among other things what will impede people from feeling united, and won't help create a shared European citizenship when certain languages will naturally beat out others at the top most levels
>On this topic, can you lot start speaking Gaelic more often
It's such a beautiful language
It's a language that is basically only spoken in the Highlands and Islands, and which was devestasted by the Clearances, suppression following the Jacobite Rebellions, and general indifference from other parts of Scotland
There isn't really any way to use it day to day unless you live in a particularly Gaelic part of the islands and being absolutely honest, it'll probably never be used like Catalan or other regional languages are, given it isn't even *the* language of Scotland, but of the rural, sparsely populated periphery
I've lost my Gaelic due to lack of any sphere to speak it in
There are attempts to help it, but no one wants to fund rural teuchters language, so no, we can't speak more of it, because it isn't as easy as that
More or less my point
There is a reason language tends to be a unifying aspect of a state: if you can't communicatw with your fellow citizens, you don't feel connected
It's one of the things that bind people together
I think most people just don't think about it
Most of the time it's brought up is as a joke ie person says they're going to go to India and then someone makes a joke about not staying for 150 years this time
&#x200B;
When it's talked about seriously the emotions of older people range from cautiously positive to very negative (with some outliers) and the emotions of younger people range from neutral to negative with more around the sort of neutral point (again with some outliers)
Recently Personally I’ve see more and more young people being pro empire something I thought was long gone from the average brits life
But even just out in the street I’ve noticed a lot more young people that are proud to be ‘British’ and are proud about the empire
I still think they are a minority but I just find it odd that it’s still something people care about
Also when I mean young people I’m talking older teens not 20s as I’m more than certain that many people who are in there 20s are the most anti empire generation to date
I'd say the split is actually pretty consistent, over all ages
lots of people will disagree with me but being 22, the social media generation, it is quite common to presume everyone your age has the same opinion as you
That is just how social media seems to function, but there are plenty of youths who feel the world is better because of imperialism, and maybe even some more who yearn for a return to imperialism
I think it depends on your politics, I would say if your left you recognize empire was a terrible time for the people that were colonized, where as some on the right would like to see those days back again
Im 16
I despise having to acknowledge the atrocities we committed in the name of the empire
Like it's utterly disgusting
Scottish first names like Angus, Hamish and Morag would be a give away, alongside Gaelic names like Eilidh and Seoridh
Scottish surnames, of course, typically start with Mc or Mac like the infamous McDonalds
Not specifically, as there's been a lot of internal migration, but thanks to Scottish clans, some surnames are still distinctly associated with certain parts of the country
- MacLeod - the Hebrides, especially Skye
- McNeill - the Hebrides, especially Lewis and Harris
- Gordon - the North East, especially Huntley
- MacRae - the Kintail area (the Kinlochshiel shinty team is always about 70% MacRae)
Names ending "-bister" are local to Orkney and Shetland
There's countless others, but it's worth noting that Scotland is a heavily urbanised country now, and you'll find folk in the cities with these names that have no known connection to that area
In terms of first names, Gaelic names - especially with Gaelic spelling - Ruaridh, Eilidh, Sine, were traditionally associated with the north west Highlands and Islands, but now there's something of a fashion for middle-class parents to give their children a traditional name
Nordic names - Rognvald, Thorfinn etc
are still almost exclusive to Orkney and Shetland, and even there, standard Scots names are more common
Most of our surnames are pretty obvious, since where the Scottish clans were based is mostly public knowledge
Off the top of my head - people with the surnames Sutherland, Mackay, Sinclair and Gunn are mostly from Caithness (very top of Scotland)
MacDonald, McLeod, Campbell, MacKenzie are usually west coast/Hebrides
Grieve, Flett, Moar, Balfour, Linklater, Tait, Rendall, Drever, Leask, Isbister, Clouston, Harcus - all Orcadian names (Orkney Islands)
Fraser, Gordon and Douglas are from the borders
Taylor and Stewart/Stuart is everywhere
There's your typical Gaelic first names as well, pretty common here
Names like Nairn and Isla too
If your first name is Senga, you are likely a middle aged Weegie (Glasgow) woman
Probably a bit of a chav
Not so much nowadays, but having a surname for a first name used to be a sure-fire signifier that you were from a Presbyterian background
Similarly, in Glasgow anyway, Irish-sounding or Saints’ names implied you were a Catholic
Examples:
Chalmers Paton = Past Grand Master of the Orange Order
Francis McAvennie = Former City Councillor and Celtic Fan
Oh gosh, what have I done
...probably shouldn’t mention my surname is actually English
Yes, there’s certainly some truth in that
I imagine less true of Gaelic names though
I think if you were to combine a common Scottish first and second name, you’d certainly infer at least Scottish ancestry though
That’s very interesting
I didn’t know that
Wonder if it’s somewhat more prevalent in the west as I’m in Edinburgh and don’t feel as though I can think of many examples amongst friends and colleagues
I’d say it’s much more prevalent in Glasgow, and I don’t think parents think much about preserving traditional family names any longer
But my father has one of these “Protestant names” despite his family later converting to Catholicism (leading to some surprise and suspicion) and my uncle had to pretend his name wasn’t Patrick when he started working in the 1960s.
The sectarianism in Glasgow was so strong when I was young that I’ve heard family members assert that they can spot a Catholic or Protestant from the shape of their face
Trevor Francis is an Englishman
He’s beyond the trivially small world of West of Scotland Sectarianism

No because of 3 main reasons:

- It makes the government not feel the need to support members of the armed forces since we are donating our own money
Personally I don't (but I'm also not a fan of the peer pressured public perfomance of the minutes silence either)
I'm not particularly interested in public perfomances for these events, nor the weight some sections of the public place on it
Not upset by them or would disrupt anyone doing it, but
I don't need a minute set aside or a badge to remember what my family did or the many people from my village who died in the world wars, whose names sit on the arch to the local cemetery

I feel like Czech Republic sounds too long winded and formal and harks back to their communist history
If you consider surrounding countries like Austria and Slovakia too, it’s a good fit
Idk, most people here in Scotland say Czech Republic
Usually changing a country's name (or shortening it) doesn't really get to most places
Most people will probably still call it by its current name
Obviously this isn't the case for everywhere though
It sounds better, saying "Czech Republic" makes it sound like some sort of group
I've had that same thought lmao
Reminds me of a joke I heard ages ago
The Scottish are Jocks, the Irish are Paddies, the Welsh are Taffies and the English are wankers

In the case of Scots language I believe we're divided into about 10 dialect groups, but with differences within them too i.e. Shetlandic and Orcadian are lumped under "Insular Scots" but the two of them are still fairly different (but much closer than, say, Southern Scots or Ulster Scots)
Doric is very different to glaswegian
Is it quite easy for Turks to communicate with people from Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan etc
Some schools cover some Scots nowadays, generally around Burns Night
Gaelic is taught in some areas but it wasn’t an option for me growing up
The number of schools offering it is increasing though, the main problem is a lack of teachers
I was taught Doric (a dialect from the North East) in school however it was never an official class, just something my primary teacher tried to instill in us
Gaelic is an option in some secondary schools but not many, if it is then it tends to be schools on the west coast
It is officially a language
It's as much to English is as Norwegian is to Swedish
yeah, exactly
they're official languages
the opinion of linguists matters more than the opinion of laypeople on the internet
and the decision to treat scots as a dialect was made by unionist politicians
Within Scotland:
Dundee = tech, Aberdeen = Oil, Everywhere = tourism, Edinburgh = everything else
Within the UK:
Everything = London,
Everything else = London,
Seriously, can anywhere else in the country please get something
= no, London
Glasgow = Drug dealing
No, there's no drug dealing in Glasgow
Just a very active ice cream van market
Yes, but Scotland is a relatively small country and so by just focussing on that I can actually highlight some stuff
By talking about the entire UK, everything just gets eclipsed by London
I think the point is that there is a certain amount of patriotism around the OXFORD/AstraZeneca vaccine, such that the OXFORD element is stressed whereas the equivalent (e.g. BioNTech) is mostly dropped for other vaccines
Just the 3, English (because obvious reasons), Gàidhlig (I'm from that end of Scotland) and Polish (last long-term serious partner was Polish and started learning the language for her family)
Edit: 5
Forgot French and German
Edit 2: 7
Forgot Spanish and Italian like an eejit
Could stretch it to an 8 and be able to recognise Irish because of how similar our languages are but I can't say I know it
I think 11: English, Spanish (Castilian), French, Italian, Dutch, German, Polish, Slovak, Swedish, Russian, Turkish
I try to learn thanks etc when going to another country I could be wrong with some of these
French-merci
Spanish-gracias
German danke
Dutch - dank je
Danish - tak
Sweden - tak
English,French,German,Polish,Hungarian,Italian and Spanish so that’s 7
I’ll guess English too
Tapadh leat for the list
Huh, that's a lot more different from 'tapadh leat' than I expected
Though the Irish one makes sense enough to me
Interesting
Okay I do know them XD Spanish ex-flatmate and Italian cousins
It's less on the point of death as you may think with the recent progress in the past decade to re-educate the youth Scottish culture like what happened in Ireland (but not to the same extent due to our lack of independence)
But to answer your question, on the West Coast of Scotland you'll have a higher chance of someone who knows "tapadh" as "thank you" due to the Highland and Hebridean diaspora focusing on Glasgow and surrounding areas
On the East Coast
You'd be lucky for someone to know "tapadh" outside of vaguely recognising the word exists in the world
Thank you is actually "tapadh leat" or "tapadh leubh" depending on the context :-)
To confirm, I'm from the east coast, didn't know of tapadh leat/leibh until this year when I tried the new Duolingo course and I'm in my thirties
Moved the Edinburgh about a year ago for uni, would you say East Coast is more Scots with Doric being around in Aberdeen
Yep, definitely
Gaelic speakers existed all over but in more recent (last 300 - 400 years or so) times it was more due to immigration rather than it being a native language in the East and central belt (plenty of Gaelic speakers in Glasgow but most had moved there rather than being natives)
Doric is the Aberdeen/Aberdeenshire dialect, reaching as far as Nairn to a greater or lesser extent
Scots itself has multiple other dialects though, the difference between Glasgow and Edinburgh is quite clear at times (bairn vs wean for example)
That's one way of putting it
> I had no idea it refered to "The Troubles"
It doesn't. It refers to the Anglo-Irish War in the early 1920s.

Contrary to popular belief, the Scots/Gaelic word “loch” actually isn’t a direct translation of the English word “lake”. While it can mean lake, it’s definition is actually slightly broader than that, as it can also mean a geographical feature found in Scotland that is similar to a Norwegian fjord
In modern English, these are sometimes referred to as “sea lochs”, but in the original Scots/Gaelic there is no distinction between them
Also (this one is probably more well know), it’s not actually supposed to be pronounced like the English word “lock”, but instead the “-ch” sound is supposed to be pronounced like it would be in German
That sound doesn’t exist in English, so most people outside of Scotland simply pronounce it as “lock”
Oh this is really cool
Just before the Scottish wars of independence we were actually going to have a Norwegian queen, but she died on the trip over so England took control instead
Penalty shootouts
Not the preceding 120 minutes of football, mind, just the penalties

Lived in Germany for half a year or so, can absolutely confirm
Weekly shop went through so fast it got home before I did
Germany have a perfect record in penalty shootouts
Scotland have a perfect record of *penalties* in penalty shootouts

Norway, Sweden and Finland = small in population, but big in landmass, resources, wealth and technology
The UK isn't that big
There plenty countries in Europe that are bigger
But It feels big
I think it's because it's an island which always means that it's clearly defined
It's like medium sized at best
Not exactly a city, but I love Kirkwall in the Orkney Islands
It's beautiful and the people are very friendly
I went on holiday there a couple of years ago and I loved it
It was sunny for once and we got to go swimming in the middle of the city
Tbh I can't think of a single city in Italy that wouldn't qualify as a nice city (for visitors at least, I'm sure locals grappling with local politics and infrastructure problems disagree)
Italians are blessed to live in such a spectacular country
I'd really recommend Galway if you ever get to go
Also I'm biased by Scotland is pretty great - Highlands, Edinburgh, Glasgow
Don't forget places like Aberdeen, Fort William, or Inverness
r/scottishpeopletwitter is pretty fucking legendary
No cunt can understand it either which makes it better
I don't really look at r/all or the popular stream, just the subs I'm subscribed too
Anytime I venture into parts unknown I've stumbled across alt right or incel twerps and that doesn't do a great deal for my mental health
So basically, I usually just see content on things I am interested in
I enjoy the fact reddit is international as I've learned a lot about other cultures, particularly the minutae and day to day stuff you don't normally read about, often largely due to this sub, but also from our American brothers and sisters and elsewhere
Primary 1 and 2 education is more learn about your body and stuff not really sex education since it’s the ages of 4-7
Primary 3 and 4 and 5 you start to learn more about ‘other’ parts but not really in depth as your still kinda young
Primary 6 and 7 is when you start to learn about puberty
In primary school normally it’s just taught by your class teacher which makes for awkward times when I this lady was just talking about dicks then goes onto doing algebra in the next lesson
In secondary school
S1-2 is just looking at puberty but more in depth
I remember also getting some speakers come and talk to us about underage sex since my area had a very high teenage pregnancy rate
S3 we learnt about STDs had to put condoms them on various fruit
S4 we had to learn about sex and what will happen if you get an STD and how to get help we also ‘learnt’ about rape but it was more just how to speak out about it and get help
This is all done by our Guidance teacher so it was a little less awkward then primary school since they were actually trained to talk about this
S5 and S6 your legally and adult so health class is wasn’t really a thing anymore
Parents, and also teachers at school
We get it at like primary 6-7 (I think) here but I think it might be earlier now because my little cousin is learning it and he's in primary 4
I've never gotten anything like "the talk" either, I probably actually learned most things from watching movies and all that
During the Second World War the Polish Army in the West was stationed in Scotland
Many of the soldiers married Scottish women, and didn't want to return to a Poland under Stalinist rule
As a gesture of thanks for the welcome they received, some of the Polish soldiers created the *Great Polish Map of Scotland*, a large 3D concrete map of Scotland
One of the other soldiers of the Polish Army in the West who settled in Scotland was an artillery corporal called Wojciech
Wojciech was unusual for a Gunner, because he was an Iranian Brown Bear
After the Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939, the Polish soldiers that had managed to avoid being murdered by the NKVD were incarcerated in the Soviet prison camp system
The Western powers and Polish government in exile were eventually able to negotiate their release and enlistment into the Polish Army in the West; on their transit through Iran, the Polish soldiers adopted a bearcub, who accompanied them through the North African and Italian campaigns
Wojciech was fond of a cigarette and beer, and was trained by the Polish gunners to carry ammunition forward
After the war, he was rehomed in Edinburgh Zoo, where it was not unknown for former Polish soldiers to enter his enclosure and share cigarettes and play with him
Wojciech - and the Polish Army in the West - are commemorated with a statue in the centre of Edinburgh
On another Edinburgh Zoo related note, the Colonel-in-Chief of the Norwegian Royal Guard is a penguin at Edinburgh Zoo called Nils Olav
The Norwegians were visiting Edinburgh to perform at the Royal Military Tattoo in the 1970s, when they heard that the penguins in Edinburgh Zoo were originally donated by Roald Amundsen, following his successful South Polar Expedition
To commemorate this achievement and celebrate the links between Norway and Scotland, a penguin was selected, given the name Nils Olav, and enlisted in the Norwegian Royal Guard
Apparently Hungarians have a stereotype about Scottish people that we're tight with our money
Not really much of a relation but your average Scottish person will most likely know absolutely nothing about Hungary, probably unable to point it out on a map, so it's weird to think they're sitting over there joking about us
I was actually gonna comment this, but I did some research first to get the facts right and turns out it’s just a myth
The war declaration and peace treaty both use the term “United Kingdom”, which regardless of the Anglo-Scottish border, includes Berwick
Primarily see myself as British/Scottish, but where it makes sense to specify, I'll note being half-Spanish/Catalan (given that is where the bulk of my family is from and lives)
I don't speak Spanish but my brother and sister have learned it to some extent, I just struggle with learning languages badly
I have generally good feelings about Spain/Catalonia, but obviously I disagree with certain things both do, just as I disagree with parts of British and Scottish culture and politics
One half of my family is from Scotland the other half from Ireland, well things seem similar in both so think I'd be ok
Two apocrifal tales involving Robert the Bruce and spiders:
After one of his (many) failed attempts at kicking the English out he was hiding in a cave contemplating giving up and moving to France when he saw a spider trying to make a web
The spider failed time and time again but didn't give up until it eventually succeeded, inspiring Robert to try war again which he won resulting in another 400 years of independence
Same circumstances as the first one, he was being chased by English soldiers and hid in a cave
A spider built a web over the entrance and the English seeing that moved on allowing him to escape and fight again
As the understand it
He was more paid too little money to leave her alone
Scotland isn't a part of England though, what
Not necessarily phrases but the *phrasing* of Spanish we were taught
When I went to Madrid during my gap year, my otherwise fairly fluent Spanish got me funny looks all the time
I didn’t really understand what was wrong until my friend Maria explained that I was basically being *too polite* and “too full” in the things I was saying
I was continually using conditionals for questions, laden with “if possible”s and thank yous unnecessarily where only a couple of words could do
She also told me that I was using “Usted/es” too often and should stop asking people our age if we can “tutearnos”.
It was a hard habit to break since using politer structures was required to get the necessary grades in school
Kind of depends on the social class/age of your audience :)
We got taught the “baiser” kiss thing too
I dated a French guy at uni for a while and while trying to conjure up my rusty French I used it
Turns out that that was totally acceptable for us to do in the end anyway
We used to, but its died out now that most folk use mobiles
My parents (now in their 80s) did it when they first got a landline
I don't, nor any of the younger generations
Mustn't grumble :)
There's one area in Scotland with a couple of small towns I know of that sometimes refer to their town centre as the "precinct". The rest of us think it's a bit weird to be honest
>'Supper' when referring to dinner, I have only seen people referring to 'fish supper' (fish and chips)
What about if you're having a light meal after dinner but before bed
I'd call that supper too
You can also use 'shut up
' to express disbelief
'I won the lottery today'
'Shut up
Very informal though
My pal's mam went to uni in her forties and subsequently became posh
By that point she insisted that her bairns answered the phone "[number], how my I help you
". We used to rip the piss out of him for it, he claimed she periodically phoned the house to check that he was still doing it
Honestly, even the "may I" part is weird enough in Scotland
My grandma used to do it and insist we answer that way
I was surprised to find out other people *didn’t*.
Same in Scottish Gaelic
No word for yes or no, you reflect back the verb in the question
It's quite common in technical writing in general
There's a class element to it
For the upper middle-class supper is an informal evening meal eaten with the family, whereas dinner is a much more formal evening meal
To lower middle-class and working class people, supper is a snack before you go to bed and dinner can be either your midday or evening meal, depending on where you're from
Not that that helps you much ;)  Native speakers from the UK are very attuned to class markers in speech, whether they're aware of it or not
Current slang would be 'You don't like pizza, innit' :)
"Cheers, thanks, ta, thanks".
Really
Do you live near Eton
'Should' has an implication of 'ought to, but don't worry if you can't'.  Shall is more 'you must do it this way'.
Might be more of an English thing, I actually can't remember the last time I heard someone say "shall" to be honest
I do see it in technical documents fairly often though
That's what supper is in my part of Scotland too
(Along with the aforementioned fish supper, sausage supper etc
from the chippie)
Pupils go to primary or secondary school (mandatory education), students go to college or university
Fair enough
We'd go breakfast, lunch, tea/dinner (main meal after work/school, both words used), maybe supper before bed

There's a place very similar not far from you
*Pssst* (It's called Scotland)
People seem to just stay around where they've always lived and where their family is, at least from my experience
Either staying roughly where they're from provided they can afford it (second homes are killing the Highlands and Islands) or often from small to big
Remote working due to the Rona has made some people start look the other way though
Usually, although I personally moved from a larger place to smaller
This wasn’t on a sign, but in a local newspaper advising on how to be a responsible dog owner in a rural community:
“Always keep a tight hold of your dog’s lead around farm animals
Common sense one would think, but it went on:
“Unless you are being chased by cattle, in which case, let go”
Fortunately we don’t have a dog, so if any cattle end up chasing us we should be fine
>At the time, England was hosting the Euro '96 football championships and a Russia vs

Well, Russia vs Germany is always an explosive event
From all the stories I've heard from American Park rangers, it seems they have a chronic problem of incredibly stupid tourists who always manage to kill themselves
Apparently a lot of people think that "National Park = Theme Park" and forget that it's a genuine wilderness
When my friend visited Yellowstone, he saw signs and pamphlets telling people to not try and ride Bisons, not to feed the Grizzly Bears, and not to try and pet or give belly rubs to any wolves
I was being sarcastic, but thank you for the warning
The 6 Nations is huge, and a lot of non-rugby fans will take an interest when Scotland are playing
We only have two professional rugby clubs, Glasgow and Edinburgh, and in terms of popularity, both pale in comparison with the professional football clubs they share their cities with
Club rugby has a small but consistent playing population throughout the country, except in the Borders, where rugby is the most popular sport and football and afterthought
Rugby League exists, but is very niche, and largely played by people that have moved up from its heartlands in the north of England
3rd biggest sport besides from football and drinking
More football than anything else here
I never really hear anything about rugby at all to be honest
I know my neighbour used to play it but that's about as far as it goes
It’s probably the third most popular sport, though it’s kind of seen as a posh sport (definitely posher than Shinty football or golf)
Football is of course miles ahead in popularity, and in terms of people playing it golf is too, although more people watch rugby than golf I’d say
Course in the Highlands it’s Football and Shinty, rugby is not an option
All we got in high school was rugby and "cross country running" which was really the PE teacher telling us to fuck off into the woods so we'd go buy sweets and cigarettes, lazy bastard would just sit in his office for an hour
Oh and in the first year they awkwardly made you dance with girls and called it PE
I think it’s another way of saying American football but I could be missing it completely
yeah, I don't know if you could even keep milk out the fridge without it going bad but I could see how eggs are able to sit out of the fridge
Either way we just keep them in the fridge
I’m the UK yes we do refrigerate our milk and eggs
if you buy room-temperature eggs, you really shouldn't refrigerate them
It can cause moisture to build in the layers of stuff under the shell, and allow bacteria to grow & things to penetrate the egg
If it has been washed and refrigerated before you buy it, then it's fine
> so why not
Because then for many cooking things you have to let them warm up to room temperature to use them
For eggs it seems to be personal preference
I refrigerate mine because I don't have a cool basket thing for them to go in and I'm not leaving the box sitting out
I think most restaurants actually prefer that nowadays
If Irish law is anything like Scots law, you wouldn't have been able to retroactively prosecute anyone who bought, sold, or used during the 24 hours
If you possessed it after the 24 hours when the loophole was plugged then that would've been illegal
However, if any damages were caused during this period by people under the influence, the state would be liable to pay out the compensation due to negligence so long as the damage were physical
But then again, I know Jack Squat about Irish law
In Scots law, damages are only payable so long as they're physical
With rare exceptions, purely economic damage will never be recoverable
If any damages to anyone's property were caused by people under the influence of the drugs (whether true or argued well) then the state would be liable (rather than the actual individual) as it was their negligence in accidentally causing the loophole that directly led to the damages occurring
Because this is purely hypothetical with nothing in my mind similar enough to set relevant precedent, take what I say with a pinch of salt
Disclaimer that I am just a student, and while Ive received my merit pass in delict (Scots law equivalent of tort), I'm in no way an expert
In my opinion it could go a few different ways depending on the Sheriff at first instance
1 - The Sheriff is a traditional fuckwad and outright refuses the claim on the grounds that they made a claim against the wrong party
Without a doubt the pursuers (I believe the word in English law is plaintiff) would appeal upwards, and then it would either be "well, you made a mistake in sueing the wrong party it's your fault you can't claim back" or "we'll say the state is liable and push the case up to ensure you get compensation for damages from them".
2 - The Sheriff is uncomfortable with making a clear decision and pumps it upwards to the Sheriff Principal
A SP would be able to have the authority to direct the claims against the Crown unless the higher court (Court of Session) steps in and tells them to fuck off (which wouldn't happen because the state are the liable ones here)
3 - The Sheriff themselves I doubt would hold at first instance the state is guilty and should pay because they're not mentioned at all in this original hypothetical case
Of course, they ***could*** but they would seriously be risking their position as a Sheriff and destroying any chances to advance up the ladder if they were wrong in any way
I think he works at the actual office and not a bank branch
Office workers in banks tend to work long hours and a lot of the time on Saturday
How would you compliment your S/O in your native language
My missus can speak over 15 languages and last night she dropped the "love you" for the first time and i only found out this morning with googles aid
Why do you think she said that in the first place mate lol
Im pinching that one
Aye cheers pussyblaster im sure you're a credible source of flirtatious material  lol
Doing my nut in lol
I actually couldn't say for certain but it's over 15
She started young and had a love of language (and learning
the lassies a million times smarter than me) but it's funny i only know english/scots and she is terrible at Scots so i one up her there
No in my accent mate it would gie her the boke
She kens how i feel I'm just looking to shock the shit outta her by responding one day
It's not really the done thing here either as it can be seen as cheesey or soppy
I'll say stuff to her like "your no too bad i might keep you" or "when your in this kinda mood your almost tolerable"
Added to my list

Much similar but drunk by the bottle
Made you fuckfast though right
Lie to our people
Theres a lot of cunts on that list, and Ive no idea on who's authority they were placed there
He was basically preached against at my school
He was pissed at the Scots for being the wrong sort of Protestant and killed rather a few of us as a result
No, a lot academy/high school girl looks exactly the same because they all get the same shitty orange tan from the same place
Scotland isn't a Northern country but we do have the gloomist city in Europe, it is Glasgow
People here see tans as healthy and yet most of us are pale
Never heard anyone say anything bad from a tan unless it's mega dark from being in sun all the time
Not at all
Many people here enjoy going to places like Southern Spain and Southern Portugal purely to lie by the hotel pool/beach and sunbathe
And people use tanning salons
The Scottish accent makes us sound angry when we pronounce it
I don't know how anyone else in the world views Scottish accents in regards to being uneducated or whatnot other than "haha funny hard to understand lolol" but there certainly are accents here that are viewed on as lower class and upper class, but it's probably more to do with how many Scots words you use other than the accent itself even though that will play a part in it
Upper class people tend to use less Scots words or "slang" and lower class people tend to use more
I've also noticed that upper class people tend to use a flat r (the type you hear in an American accent) other than a tapped r which sometimes really doesn't sit well on my ears hearing it with a Scottish accent
People here are giving very reddit appropriate answers
Sure people on reddit wouldn't consider it weird and most people probably wouldn't care enough to even notice if you were sat down in a restaurant but yeah people who notice are often going to think it's a bit weird
I eat out alone often
I've never felt judged for it, although some restaurants are clearly geared-up for quick individual workday lunches (small tables, perhaps a counter, quick service), while others are expecting larger groups to be there for a while (large tables, slow service, proper table-cloths)
I always take a book with me; if you dine with a book, you are never alone
I used to eat alone in restaurants when I travelled for work
I did get a few odd looks, but mostly no-one seemed to care
It beat eating a sandwich in my hotel room
I don't find it weird, you eat in subway / Kfc along so why not a restaurant
Nope
It's one of those very interesting if slightly mental aspects of the USA in my opinion
Just crazy that it goes on out there and when you read the news articles about bounty hunters busting in guns blazing, even killing innocent people etc
mental
No we don't have bounty hunters
The closest we have in Scotland are [Sheriff Officers] but they are only allowed to operate on the orders of the court and don't have the power to arrest anyone
Today they only legally exist in the US and the Philippines though I'm sure bits of Africa have them in function
The complete reign of the market, unfettered and untamed, is itself a form of totalitarianism
I think a less known Scottish dish that deserves some attention is Cullen Skink- basically a soup made with smoked fish, cream and potatoes
It has a lightly smoky flavour and is delicious
Slice (square sausage) and tattie scone on a roll
Gorgeous
My dad makes that on special occasions, definitely my favourite German dish
> Different stews with lentils, beans, chickpeas and many others
My wife (who is Spanish) calls it 'cocido de no sé qué con cosas' and it's always delicious
I'd also suggest white pudding (oatmeal (prefereably pinhead), onions and pork fat in a skin) and for dessert crannachan (cream, toasted oatmeal and fresh raspberries)
I have always thought Italy has the best cuisine
If I could only eat one for the rest of my life, there would be no contest
Scotland has 6:
[St Kilda]
[Edinburgh Old Town] and [New Town]
[The Heart of Neolithic Orkney]
[New Lanark]
[The Antonine Wall]
[The Forth Bridge]
Edit: I screwed up the link for Antonine Wall
My bad
Fixed it now
Always a debate in the uk about how to pronounce scone, either rhyming with gone or bone
I’m never really sure but scone rhyming with gone is more common in Scotland
We also have all sorts of debates over what to call a bread roll which depends by region eg cobb, bap etc
There is the eternal debate about whether this thing is a *rowie* or a *buttery*.  Generally, wise, cultured toonsers from Aberdeen call it a rowie, teuchters from the shire with neeps for brains call it a buttery
Folk that call it a cookie shouldn't be allowed outside unsupervised, frankly
One set of my grandparents were Polish and staunch raisin in enthusiasts
They passed whilst I was still young but my aunt to this day ruins her cheesecakes with raisins
No, no I’d say most people in England say it like bone
Degenerates, that's who
Cream on one side, Jam on the other; avoids the debate entirely
Scone like cone may make sense but English doesn’t follow simple phonetic rules and in the UK there are so many geographic variations of pronunciation muddying the waters
Official name: The rebuplic of Scotland
Common name: Scotland
(Subtext is that we're independent)
Change Scotland to the Gaelic name, Alba
caledonia, sounds way cooler imo
Change it to just "Britain". The whole "United Kingdom" thing is a bit meh, it's not really much of a name
If that happened an embarrassingly large portion of Scotland's population would think you renamed the country after a football team in the SPFL
Also fuck the Hibs
I wouldn't be surprised if Poland used to become polenland  but got shortened at some point
But surely that wouldn't make sense
The term "Great Britain" is a purely geographical term, and as the full UK includes other places (NI) it wouldn't fit properly
A country without a monarchy
I know that but a lot of people Ive spoken to don't know that Hibernian means "Irish". We're well educated folk, but that doesn't mean there arenae fannys ;)
And whats wrong with Hibs
I support the Heart of Midlothian, we all have our crosses to bare
Love Ireland and the Irish just hate they smell hibs bastards (all in good fun of course)
You'll hear no arguments from me on that one
Whilst we're at it, fancy taking us with them
We could pull the rug for underneath them and dissolve the UK entirely
Aye my Mothers family have Irish roots but my name was mainly chosen because they like Gàidhlig names
I really like Irish names as well and luckily no one will bat an eyelid at an Irish name in Scotland
Edit: to elaborate, their might be the odd bit of clarification required on pronunciation when someone sees it written down but some names like Saoirse, Aisling, Roisin, Niamh, Sorcha (mainly female names I guess) are, if not common, definitely not considered weird or anything
Leith, as in the port in Edinburgh
Or is there a different reason you like it
I don't know if it's shallow or not, but it's cool you've found a name you've liked
Although they may get the odd funny look in Scotland
Absolute nonsense
All the usual popular labels like Nike, Adidas, North Face etc are commonly seen in Europe
In fact, plenty of them are European
Do you mean like fashion brand logos
I'd say your room mate is talking nonsense
Certainly for the UK anyway
- [These kind of North face jackets] are popular with the 'spice boys'.
- Fred Perry is a brand most commonly associated with indie kids and mods, as well some followers of the punk scene
- Adidas Gazelles are also pretty popular with indie kids and mods, as are other styles like München's, Spezial's etc
- [Pretty Green] is another huge brand here in the UK particularly with indie kids
- Stone Island and Barbour are the brands of choice amongst the wannabe football hooligans
- [Napajiri half zips] [K-way] and [this style of black North Face] are some of the popular brands I've noticed amongst the European ultras scene (soccer fan groups)
I could go on
But I need to get home from work
Aye we wear Nikes’ trackies, school bags, shoes and everything else you can think of
You fucking take that back
Not that common in Scotland but some people have it
North Face, Mountain Warehouse, Trespass, Jack Wolfskin are more popular
Maybe even Patagonia
This comment will probably get buried but fuck it, this post is bumming me out so I’m gonna list some compliments about every European country
England: you guys are a laugh and make great panel shows
Wales: cool ass flag and fantastic history and language
The Irelands: great language (not biased) and have contributed so much cool shit to Celtic culture I probably couldn’t list it all if I tried
Also good alcohol
France: fantastic food and a beautiful capital city (I haven’t been outside Paris but I’m sure that’s great too)
We all meme on you a lot, but it’s only because we love you :)
Belgium: best beer in the world, and Tin-Tin was a lot more importantly my childhood than I care to admit
The Netherlands: you have the distinction of being the only country in Europe to conquer *the  ocean itself*, which is objectively awesome
Spain: Brutal as it may be, I have to respect a people who looked at a raging, testosterone fulled bull and thought “I’m gonna fight that thing
with a blanket
”. Also, I’ve spent I surprising amount of time listening to Spanish folk music, and it’s just so fun and uplifting
Portugal: I know very little about Portugal, but your language sounds really cool
I don’t know a single word in it, but it is very pleasing to the ear
Italy: through the Roman Empire, you guys have probably done more to shape Western and Southern European culture, language, and history than any other nation by far
Also, you’ve given us all so many fantastic foods, your general architecture is magnificent
Germany: yours was the first language I ever heard that I loved so much I went out of my way to learn a bit of it
Also, if you guys hadn’t lost WWI, I wouldn’t be here today so thank you for
well, failing at that :)
Denmark: vikings are cool af, and you provided us all with some much needed levity recently by releasing that giant penis children’s show at roughly the same time that the Americans where trying to invade themselves
Norway: y’know what’s cooler than Viking’s? Vikings with mountains
Also your incredibly detailed documentation of your prison system made writing my Adv Higher sociology dissertation so much easier, so thanks for that
Iceland: you have the coolest flag in Northern Europe, your language basically just being Norse is awesome, and the fact that you once grounded all of Europe’s air traffic by lighting up a freaking volcano is metal as fuck
Sweden: IKEA is a godsend, and your meatballs are delicious
Finland: your language is wonderful and I fully intend on learning as much of it as I can as soon as I get bored of German
Estonia: you have the best flag colour scheme in the world and your accent is cool
Latvia: I gotta be honest with you, I know nothing about Latvia, but Riga looks like a very pretty city
Lithuania: the video of one of your politicians being carried away by the police in a plastic bag is honestly one of the funniest things I have ever seen
Poland: you gave me loads of great friends, your food is wonderful, and you gave us polandball which is *mostly* a good thing
Czechia: I know this is probably gonna sound generic, but Prague really is a beautiful city with a hard earned proud history of beer and incidents involving windows
Austria: your mountains are cool, and from the many times I’ve ended up there in geoguessr, Vienna looks really pretty
Switzerland: definitely the country in the mainland I’ve spent the most time in, and for good reason
You’re country is beautiful, and every aspect of Swiss society just seems to fit together like gears in a clock
You’re just so punctual and orderly, you put the rest of us to shame
Croatia: the fact that maps make it look like you just refuse to give Bosnia and Herzegovina any coastline is consistently way funnier to me than it should be
Greece: your history is awesome, your culture and language are just so old and fantastic, and Crete has given me some of my favourite holidays in my life
Also I really wanna visit Thessaloniki at some point cause it looks really nice
Turkey: Istanbul is beautiful, and Turkish food is some of the best in Europe
Romania: my roommate is from Romania and she is one of the sweetest, kindest people I’ve ever met
Also she gave me some Romanian soup spices a while ago and they where great, so I’m definitely gonna try to pick up more of them from somewhere
Ukraine: one of my best friends is from Ukraine so thank you for that
Also your language is really cool, and Kyiv is very high on my places to visit list even though I know nothing about it
Russia: fantastic language, several apparently great cities, and a fascinating history to boot, but please get rid of your current government and stop threatening Ukraine so I can appreciate you more
If you somehow managed to find this at the bottom of this thread, and your country isn’t on here then I’m sorry; it’s not because I don’t like you, it’s because I’m too stupid to know anything about you so please tell me cool and interesting facts about your country
I'd heard all my life that Germany was all about their precision
Then I had to get a train across the whole of germany
Both trains were late, and the 2nd one looked like it was from the 80s and hadn't been updated since
This was on a train trip from Hungary to the Netherlands, and I live in the UK and I'm used to bad trains, but in my limited experience their trains are just the worst
A lot of 'white settlers' in the Scottish Highlands have the same experience
Move there, buy a B&B, sell it after 3 years and move back to Dorset
The weather/bleakness/isolation is not for everyone
I think when people think of Austria they just think of cool mountains and a pretty capital city
And you guys have cool mountains and a pretty capital city, so everyone enjoys themselves and no one gets disappointed
Germany also has a large following for 'alternative' beliefs, e.g. Steiner schools/anthroposophy
Britain
*Modern*? Huh
I thought we where just living up to everyone’s expectations when all that dumb shit went down
>image which Swedes themselves never believed in
You and I must have interacted with different Swedes then
I gotta be completely honest, I’ve never been to Spain and was more being humorous with part about the bullfighting (which is a practice that I personally dislike tbh)
The part about folk music is genuine, but it was frankly the only aspect of Spanish culture I am even remotely familiar enough with to actually compliment with any sincerity
I did think the bullfighting going in there may end up controversial, and I apologise for any offends caused :(
Edit: I should also add that a huge part of the reason I had so much trouble figuring out what to say about Spain is cause there are a cultural things (like food, for instance) that I associate with Spain, but do not know if it is actually Spanish or if it came from South America originally
I didn’t want to accidentally say to you the equivalent of you saying to me “my favourite thing about Scotland is the cowboys, ice hockey, and kangaroos”, so I just went with what I knew
I'd never heard of this either, in Scotland our traditional style of flat (tenements) don't have space for a laundry room, so everyone just has a washing machine in their kitchen
> Papa**dópoulos**
So that means
son of papa
Same here
When I was in Iraq, the Polish and the Czech officers would speak to each other in English - except when the Americans were around, when they'd carry on their conversation in Polish and Czech
Not really, but maybe a little
mostly not really but hmm
just a little
England: yes
[Let us go
I do, I'm a native Scots speaker and a Gàidhlig learner
Also fluent in english but who's got the time for that
I am trying to learn Gaelic, but I've never heard anyone speak it near me (east coast)
I can speak Scots to some degree, which circa 1
5million Scots can speak and most can understand
A can speak Scots a wee bit, which aboot 1
5million Scots can speak and maist can ken
It’s a shame because it was once the majority language in Scotland
Excellent
You should change your username to DèDèDè
Scots has some but not as much as much as you might imagine
Where as gàidhlig is in a totally separate language family
Scots is very closely related to English and sometimes mutually intelligible and sometimes not
Scots does have loan words from Gaelic such as loch and also from Scandinavian languages like bairn (Scots) and barn (Swedish) meaning child
Yeah, I went camping up there and all the signs had Gaelic on as well as English
Yup, that's why I'm trying to learn it
I think the Highland Clearances had a lot to do with Scotland having next to no Gaelic speakers anymore
Lots of money goes into it but I think I've heard of one school that teaches it, and the only place I've ever seen money go into is for train station signs to have the name in Gaelic under it
Seems like a bit of a lost cause at this point, especially considering how many homeless there are
Apparently one of the big men responsible for the clearances gets a bit of a pass because he was a Jacobite, but I don't think that fixes anything lol
>Lots of money goes into it but I think I've heard of one school that teaches it
I know plenty of schools that teach it, including Gaelic Medium education throughout primary
It's just outside of Glasgow, I think all of them are in the Highlands and the Western Isles
That mixed with how the suppression of the Highlands post-Jacobite wars and the Clearances probably indicates the difficulty though: it's not a national language of Scotland but a regional one, specifically of regions the lowlands have historical had very low opinions of, so the language is handicapped that way
That said, there'a still value in keeping funding it, because it keep opportunities in the language available, which at least gives you scope to practice it,  from things like the Mód, to FilmG, to Gaelic radio and television
We aren't gonna qualify for Euro 2020
That all objective studies of policy preferences Scotland is far far less liberal than we like to portray ourselves as
That, outside of sport, all this hating on England is pretty childish
They are alright, they where even the good guys in the last war
That's a weird statistic for what is a very successful ex communist country
Mate, if we meet you in the final you'll fucking blooter us
The Norse God Ajer and big Juicy Elyounoussi are going to carry you guys to the finals
(can you guess what club team I support
I think you're forgetting somebody
I would say I know a bit about most of the Maghreb,
Algeria I know that you had a lot of protests over Abdelaziz Bouteflika and that your most recent political elections didn't go very well because everyone boycotted it
Not sure what happened with that because it fell out of the news with the coròna-bhìoras
Bloody war of independence with the French, but I know Algeria has a close affinity with France as they were colonial overlords for a long time
Other than that I don't know a lot about Algeria, its probably the least we'll known of any north African countries as people travel to Morocco and Tunisia for Tourism ( before coròna-bhìoras) Libya is well known due to the civil wars and Gaddaffi, Egypt as well as its ancient
I think Algeria is very unknown, I don't know lot about Algiers or what it would be like and apart from Oran I don't think I know any other Algerian cities
The other half of Algeria is pretty much uninhabited as far as I know as its just desert
So yes that's all really
If you set it just after that period, you could have a lot of fun with Edinburgh
You'd have the old, rabbit warren half-underground world of the Old Town, as well as the challenge of moving through the open, elegant New Town undetected
The city was starting to come life intellectually, so historical philosophers and scientists could be woven into the story, and then infiltrating Edinburgh Castle would be a great climactic mission
The voice acting would need improvement though
The Scots voices in AC: Syndicate are
not great
I hate that movie its so shit
Love actually is the big one here, which I don't mind so much
It’s a bit of a tradition but Love Actually is probably a bigger tradition now
Also, I watch Die Hard
Neds
Dress like chavs, drink Buckfast tonic wine or Mad Dog 20/20, and listen to George Bowie, Lewis Capaldi and Gerry Cinnamon
Used to be more stabby than their counterparts to the south, now less stabby thanks to the violence reduction unit
Scotland specifically has neds
Wee bams
Deutsches Fliesentisch Museum FTW
We've got both tbf i usually think of Chavs as Neds with soap
The Neds are dying out, they became fuckbois
I speak Scots Gaelic as well as English and idk I just find it really easy to speak Norwegian and Swedish I think some Norse words got into Gaelic or the Gaelic my area speaks since we were a Viking controlled area for many, many years
On top of that Irish Gaelic is obviously very similar with a few different rules but it’s very close
Welsh sounds like you should be able to understand what they are saying but in reality you have no clue what’s going on
Most native Gaelic speakers live in the Highlands and Islands and some in Argyll, Glasgow also has a large Gaelic speaker population, however everyone that speaks it also speaks English I’ve never met someone who can only speak Gaelic
As of 2020 all Scottish Secondary school are able to have Gaelic online classes to help teach people ages 11-18 to speak the language and apps such as dulingo have had support with more people learning Gaelic in dulingo that’s there is Gaelic speakers
We strip them to their underwear, wrap an English flag round them then make them walk down a "leaver " street
Liver disease
Except during the Indian Mutiny, when they decided tying folk to cannon barrels and firing them sent more of a message
Gaelic-medium education is probably the closest thing we have to truly bi-lingual education
Currently, provision is small, although it's been growing steadily since the 1980s, when it was first implemented
Currently, approximately 3,500 children are in primary GME and 1,000 in secondary
As to how well it works, it's hard to say
Gaelic has been in decline, but that's more to do with an aging population and emigration from Gaelic-speaking areas
That said, more younger people are learning Gaelic and learning in Gaelic, so there are hopes of a revival to come
Personally as a young person I think Gaelic could have a bit of a revival
I live in Glasgow so no one I know is a native Gaelic speaker but loads are interested in learning
Wasn’t there a big row with whether or not to make the Western Isles main language of instruction Gaelic and this Tory came out with a stupid comment or something like that
Aye, that concerns me slightly
The biggest growth in GME has been in Glasgow, where most of the pupils will speak mostly English with their friends, and Gaelic will just be what they use to speak to their parents/granny
I sometimes wonder if the Gaelic language strategy should be focusing on consolidation in the core areas first, but then so many young people from the Highlands move to Glasgow anyway
I wouldn't be surprised, although I don't know for certain
Here in Scotland we have a level of devolution with our own parliament
The Green Party and Scottish National Party are pro full independence for Scotland
The SNP are the largest party in the Scottish Parliament and representing Scottish constituents in Westminster
We had a referendum on independence in 2014
It was close but unsuccessful
Most Scottish people voted against Brexit and so there is a resurgence of interest in independence
Data shows that younger people are more likely to vote for independence and older against
Personally, I’m an SNP voter, anti Brexit and pro independence
I am part of the sepratist movement in Scotia
We'll get there one day
I hope
No we don’t...
I mean, my flair says it all
Well a lot of Scots really want independence
This is probably the most well known independence movement in Europe right now
Aye, but probably not that close to it unfortunately
Bit silly to think of the % increase over 307 years of union imo, especially when support increased by ~10% in the two years immediately prior to the vote and has continued to rise afterwards albeit not as dramatically
But there's many reasons that another vote should be held, not least that a pro independence government is looking like it'll win a majority in the 2021 elections, or that Brexit has completely changed the landscape of politics in the UK
And anyway, people change their minds, that's why we have elections every ~5 years
The once in a generation thing was a figure of speech and it's a bit disingenuous to hold it up as some promise of no more independence votes
Much like how Boris said he'd rather be dead in a ditch than have Brexit later than October 31st
Imo another vote will come soon after the 2021 elections and once the effects of Brexit show themselves after the end of the withdrawal period
Burn= old Scottish word for a stream, and a regular burn
But a rifle isn't a shotgun
How is a single letter 4 different words with completely different meanings
That doesn't tie/segue into the other but to conclude; yes, languages are fried
Edit: spelling
But
I genuinely don't know if you're joking or not because the Latin alphabet has all 4 of them written above
I'm very aware I should learn another language but I think Chinese and Japanese are going to be very much out of my reach
Along with Icelandic apparently
I identify as
Scottish
A cunt fae Edinburgh (that's the technical term)
European
British
In that order
Country (as in Scotland, not the UK)
We don't have provinces here, the counties have chopped and changed over the years so don't mean much to people, and my city isn't that big a deal
I imagine some people in the big cities might feel different
Some islanders would identify with the island first (or group of islands, in the case of Shetland or Orkney) but I'm from the mainland
Scottish and Aberdonian; which feels more prominent depends on the context
I grew up with the notion that the UK and Britishness was the default, but it now feels a very foreign concept
Primarily as Highland, and then both Scottish and British
Easier to identify with the Highlands as it feels quite different from the national lowland identities, and yeah, when your region is one of the ones at the bottom of the list of priorities for both levels above, its a bit more difficilt to feel very attached to them
Scotland > European
I don't identify as British, eventhough legally I am
I honestly don't know anymore
After living abroad and working internationally for years, and then coming back to the UK after Brexit, I don't have a sense of place
I feel an attachment to Europe (the idea or concept of Europe and the European Union), but that has been stolen from me by bloody Brexiters
I did have all sorts of local and regional identities, too, but those have eroded
I feel more at home in Kuala Lumpur airport, or Dubai airport, or Changi airport, or Hong Kong airport, than I do anywhere in the UK now
Put me in any upper-range business hotel from Cairo to Suva and I will feel more at home than I do anywhere in my own country
The UK is not the country it was
It has become a sad, disjointed, distorted place - a parody of itself - and I no longer feel at home here
The Britain I miss is a historical one; I can identify with the memory of the British Commonwealth as it existed in the middle of the 20th century, but not really to Britain today
I sort of residually identify as Scottish, but not really - I've been away too long, and now the place just seems sad, abandoned, neglected, provincial, parochial, poor and mouldy
If there's anything else that makes me feel a connection to place, it's a sort of ghostly connection: a connection  to myths, legends, folklore, ghost stories - all those shadowy, fragmented memories of a past that has gone
Gone, gone, it has all gone
That's what I identify with: a place that has gone
That depends if you count Scotland as a region of the UK or a country in its own right - I'm Scottish first then British
If I'm not from my area or talking to someone from elsewhere in Scotland I identify more with my city but not so much around people from here
Scottish first
Then European
If forced to use a level of abstraction deeper, I'd say South West Scotland as I've moved about a bit and don't really identify with one place there
The South West bit is really just where I'm from, not identify
Council areas can have decent identities (Highlands, Western Isles, Northern Isles), in fairness
It's a term of endearment
At least that's what the Weegies say tae us
If you have four Scots in a room then one would be an Aberdonian, one would be Invernessian, one is a Glaswegian, and the last is a cunt fae Edinburgh
Nothing else really works
I guess you could say Edinburger, but that sounds stupid
True, but if you go by the old county system it can get weird
They had Lewis and Harris in different counties from each other
Then you've got the random assortment of scattered enclaves and exclaves that made up Cromartyshire
I imagine that's a reaction to how the English/Scots speaking Central Belt-biased governments, royals and the like have treated them over the years, attempting to wipe out their culture, language and so on
The amount of people around here that are so deluded and think Gaelic was never a thing here is unreal
Never mind all the Gaelic-influenced placenames
Sorry, I wasn’t clear but was only referring to Scotland
Anyone that’s ever met a Yorkshireman knows that English counties are far more important than ours
It's looser in Scotland, and people are more likely to identify with a council area (Highlands and Islands) than counties (Inverness-Shire isn't exactly an identity)
If anything, under council areas smaller local identites might exist, but I don't know what exactly you'd call Lochaber, or Ross, or Skye, other than local areas
My European identity was about belonging to a res publica called the European Union - a massive space across which I had rights and opportunities
That has been stolen from me
I still feel European, but my access to Europe has been blocked off
Brexit can go take a long walk off a short cliff
Yeah, the Small Isles south of Skye were also divided, Eigg in Inverness-shire, the other three sat in Argyll-shire
I'd forgotten that they'd been abolished by 1975 (before my time), and personally I blame the post office for tricking me
Pretty much
Occasionally you'll get holdouts who'll keep writing their address the old way like your Greater Manchester/Lancashire example, generally if they feel their new area is less prestigious than their older one but that's mostly older people
I would still be able to move for a new job in Berlin, Madrid, the Hague or Stockholm
That's what's been closed off
A whole host of job opportunities - jobs that most British people wouldn't even consider because they live in tiny, closed, monolingual worlds
It was very simple: you could see a job anywhere in the EU and apply for it, on equal terms with anyone else in the EU
If you got the job (some needed language skills, but a surprisingly large number of jobs in various technical or specialist fields did not), you could jump on a plane, get your stuff shipped, rent an apartment, and hey-presto you are living the European Dream
Now that opportunity is extremely limited
don't know how much this counts, but the name carl (depends on your accent, lighter accents probably won't have this issue), it always ends up sounding like "carol" since we add an extra vowel because the L at the end is pronounced more like "ow"
Native English speaker but a Scottish accent, seems to be the close proximity of of the Rs and the Ls, they just get all tangled up
Burglary, Architecturally and the name Karl
I don't know anything about the way czechs pronounce things but it's probably the spelling that's throwing you off, try thinking of it being spelt as "joolery"
Beat me to it
I pronounce the L at the end like an actual L though
I actually knew a Scottish guy called Karl, his parents must have been off their nuts
where about are you from
both my a's are the exact same in cancel and car
I also still tap my r with saying carl, I feel like I'd essentially be shifting my accent if I was to use a flat r or if I were to annunciate the L
Cumfurt-able in my accent
If nothing else we tend not to skip syllables in Scotland at least (in fact we end up adding in extra a lot of the time
oh fair enough, I send my condolences
This is just a personal experience and completely anecdotal, but I was in Dusseldorf for the weekend at the end of January/beginning of February 2020 and witnessed about 3 or 4 fights on the Friday night in the outside areas of a few different bars in the altstadt
On the Saturday evening the police had to close a street in the altstadt because some Fortuna Dusseldorf and Eintracht Frankfurt fans decided to have a scrap (the two teams had been playing earlier in the day)
My experiences of the UK and Germany are pretty similar - most of the drunken violence happens in small towns where there's not much else to do
I've followed my team around Europe, and the worst trouble I've seen at the football has been in Madrid and in Groningen
This is thread is full of stereotypes, and most of them are fairly off
It'd be like starting a thread entitled, *why are the Spanish such bull murdering savages, when the English only hunt foxes
My experience lines up with yours
Not sure why some continentals seems to think we're more antisocial than them
Possibly just the prevalence of English language media that reports on these fights when they occur, dunno
New Zealand feels very similar to the UK, with a lot of the South Island feeling very similar to Scotland
There’s the obvious cultural similarities, but even the landscape feels familiar
I was driving in the South Island and there were lots of places where I could just as easily have been driving in the Highlands of Scotland
Parts of the North Island reminded me of the South of England
Dunedin is literally the furthest city on Earth from my home, but it feels familiar in many ways
It’s named after Edinburgh and even has the same street names as Edinburgh
The area by the sea is Portobello, after the same area in Edinburgh
The city was even founded by the nephew of Scotland’s national poet, Robert Burns
I found myself instantly very at home in Tanzania
I’ve no idea why because on the face of it it’s very unlike Scotland
But everything seemed so familiar in a way that I’ve not experienced anywhere else
I agree with this
The sheep farming, the landscapes, it all feels oddly familiar
Apparently New Zealand's Maori name [Aotearoa] means "Land of the Long Clouds" too haha
We only had one or two lectures left at uni so we got YouTube videos
We have a town called Dumfries
It's pronounced like dumfreasse
Piper Alpha
168 men died on a burning oil rig because someone lost the bit of paper saying a high pressure valve was welded shut for maintenance
The film *Fire in the Night* about the disaster is incredibly well made and very moving
I see a sucpicous lack of Germans here
Brexit
Basically a lack of safety protocol and mismanagement lead to nearly 200 workers dying in a fire and explosion on an oil platform
Your accent is so strong
What
I don't understand what you're saying
Nah, normally it's something about Haggis, Whisky or Kilts
Oh, and nobody eats deep-fried mars bars
Don't forget the classic "what clan are you from
Ah yeah, the classic American line
Along with the customary "I'm Scaaaaaaattish too
My great-great-great-grandfather was from the McAllister clan
Not even slightly, utterly gutted
We have had snow in the Highlands, but in Glasgow/Edinburgh there hasn't been any
Oddly not unless you head out to the munros (mountains >3000ft tall) however it has seemed to snow later and later in winter for the last few years so maybe we'll see some yet
Just a wi bit a couple of days, nothing major at all though
We seem to often get our big snow in like March-May these last few years though
That one famous picture of nessie probably
European Portuguese (no offence, Brazil)
When my ex-girlfriend spoke to her flatmate in rapid-fire Polish it sounded like birdsong (if there's a bird that interrupts its normal twittering with *tak
tak
tak
tak
tak*...)
That said, I've also heard other folk speaking Polish and it's not very nice at all
Spanish is pretty good, Arabic spoken by someone who isn't nuts also sounds pretty good
Ma ain yin

Nice username, our national dish
^^^the ^^^one ^^^that ^^^isn't ^^^heroin
I'll see what I can do
I understand what you mean, fair enough
There's just something about European Portuguese that I really like
Yeah, this is true, even when we speak English it's noticeable
It makes it a bit easier for me to roll the R when I speak Spanish, so it's useful I guess
True, and it makes sense to be fair
Aren't the Windsors kinda mostly german than actually english
You just have to be a British citizen to hold executive office in the UK, its not like the USA where only American-born citizens can be President
Yeah they’re basically more everything but English now
Oh crikey that's something I never thought about
but I would assume it doesn't matter as if you're abroad when you give birth you can still get the child registered back home (at least in the UK)
My gran was born in South Africa and registered in Ayr, I was born in San Diego and registered in Glasgow
We have Oversees Birth Certificates you can order through any British embassy for a fee
This isn't required for citizenship though, the only requirement there is that one of the parents is also a British citizen
The States, though, seem to be fairly similar
From what I recall for Presidency, you need to either be born 1) on American soil 2) on the soil of an American dependency (eg Puerto Rico because the USA are still as imperial as the rest of us ex-empire Europeans
Funny how a Puerto Rican \*can\* be elected President but \*cannot\* vote in any presidential elections) 3) to two US citizens and lived in the USA for a set amount of time (this is off the back of trying to remember studying politics 4/5 years ago
i think like 30 years maybe

>The national high school exams are often considered prime exciting news, even though they always happen at the same time and in the same manner
Do you get the "kids open results live on national TV" event as well
We always have some story about exam problems, grade inflation, some kid starting a petition because the maths exam was hard, etc, every May, then by August we have shots of kids getting their results during an interview, with at least 1 kid who failed and didn't get what they needed

"Fair fa' your honest, sonsie face, Great chieftain o the puddin'-race
From the Address to a Haggis
In Scotland it would most likely be the first line of "To a Mouse by Robert Burns"
>*"Wee, sleekit, cowrin, tim'rous beastie,
O, what a pannic's in thy breastie
In Scotland we celebrate Robert Burns every year in what is called Burns Night
People get together and have a traditional meal (Haggis,neeps and tatties) and a Burns poem is recited
There are many meals organised by small communities and organisations and its a good way of getting out and meeting friends especially for the older population
Even if people don't celebrate burns they will still have haggis for a meal around that time of year
Throw in a dash of Angel’s Share and Neds and we’ve just summed up a country
That’s true, I forgot that part
Aside from the universal commandment of "don't be a dick"; assuming we're part of England is not a way to make friends here
Terrorist shit
The locals will set you on fire and toe your baws
obviously you can acknowledge the fact but I wouldn't bring it up, it might annoy some people even if they don't show that they're annoyed
Depending on where you are and who you’re talking to, you could get hurt or into a massive argument
Some Scots are happy with being British citizens, some are not
All of them know the legal status
I don't see why you'd need to *acknowledge* it - it's something they already know
Pointing out the legal fact of someone's citizenship when they're talking about the emotional subject of nationality and identity is a bit of a non-sequiter, and is often used as a way of dismissing someone's opinion, so I'd advise against it
Because we aren't English
I'm also a Canadian myself and as one I really don't like being called an American either because I'm not American and I'm happy not to be
I'm British sure but I'm also Scottish and that's a very distinct identity from English
Offer to buy them a drink, and chat to them
We're generally quite 'Northern European', so tend to be quite reserved with strangers until alcohol comes into the mix
In terms of the humour, being able to take a joke, and being willing to make a joke at your own expense are seen as important, otherwise it can be seen as arrogant or standoffish
No, they're soldiers and the UK has pretty strict rules about when and how military aid to the civil power can be used
The actual guarding is done by the police these days
>Oh, is that how British people do X? You Brits sure say X a lot
It's my first time in Britain, really enjoying it thanks
etc etc
Sure, all those are fine, as you say, uncontroversial observations of the sort a visiting tourist might make
"acknowledgement that Scottish citizens are British citizens" is a bit different, to casually (correctly) referring to Scots as British though
It's making it specifically about citizenship that makes it weird
There's a lot of internet fannies that try to use that argument, as jf I'm suddenly going to say "oh, you're right, I've just checked my passport and you're absolutely right
Time to stop campaigning for independence
", And not, "well, for now, anyway".
As for a tourist doing it in real life - it would be highly odd
> Yes well, the day that people start stooping to the lows of the internet in real life is the day that the sane people need to jump off a bridge
I agree wholeheartedly
Sadly, it appears to be something our politicians need reminded of from time time to time
Do people here really think it's a luxury
I would describe it more as a go-to budget furniture place for most people
Every student goes there to buy stuff for their flats/halls of residence, and young families will get the bulk of their things there as well when moving in/renovating
Besides that, it's seen mostly as a day out for families/couples which starts off fun (look, the wardrobe has a funny name
) and ends up in divorce
>IKEA has always been seen as a de facto luxury brand
This is just untrue
It's seen as affordable furniture shop with easy to assemble products
>DAIM bars and licorice are seen as exotic
Really
I can go into any supermarket or corner shop and can buy a Daim bar
Any half decent sweetie shop worth its salt sells liquorice all sorts
They're both as common as muck

How do you get that they 'aren't Europe' from what I said

Austrian / Bavarian smoked cheeses are my go-to burger topping
There's loads
My town (Aberdeen) has a particularly high Polish population and we've got tonnes of Polish grocery shops and delis
All the big supermarkets, and even some of the smaller places as well, all have a decent selection  of Polish goods too
It's pretty good for me as I had a Polish girlfriend for five years so I acquired a taste for a lot of your country's cuisine
I'll be damned if pierogi, topped with fried onions, chopped bacon and sour cream, isn't one of the greatest comfort foods ever created
Gołąbki, bigos, kotlet, all the soups, salads and sausages
you guys do food right
Yeah theres a few polish shops
There used to be on in my town but its been closed for a while now
Yes, both Polish grocery shops and Polish sections in some supermarkets
I prefer the Polish mustard and Polish red cabbage to the normal varieties
I also like the Słask sausages and Tyskie beer
Yes
I come from Aberdeen where there's a large Polish population in an area called Torry so Aberdeen has quite a few however since moving to Glasgow I've noticed there are less but still a few dotting about
Most supermarkets even have a little Polish section
Scotland is full of them after a lot of Poles moved here after WW2
Off the top of my head I can think of one in Glasgow,  a butchers specifically I'm sure
It always looks great from the window but ive never been in
My mother will buy nothing but Polish bread these days - and I love kabanos
Finland, it’s cool
(Pun definitely intended)
Germany, over the last 200 years they have seriously influenced the shape of Europe, but all a lot of us remember is UK/France (napoleon) and ww1/2 (albeit huge German involvement in all of these
Sweden, especially the great Northern war, I always find it interesting to think about what if Sweden won that war and was/is a world superpower
I find Germany's history interesting
I love learning about the Holy Roman Empire and the time around unification in the 1870s-. Germany's facinating history always gets brushed off to the side due to WW2
It's sad
I’m from Scotland (directly invaded by vikings) and we weren’t taught about it either
Some schools/courses focus on certain things or are just shit
Edit: Just to clarify I mean not taught about Scandinavian history
Yeah that's weird because we were definitely taught about vikings in primary
We do get taught about vikings in primary, I'd expect all schools to be more or less the same
Probably back when the Romans were trying their hands with us but the Picts scared them too much
I wanna see what the Picts looked like
The week running up to and including the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314CE
I would love to get into the mindset of the men who fought and won that battle
What were they thinking knowing that they faced an army that was superior in every way
How did they celebrate after they won
What was the battle actually like
There's a very interesting period in British history between 1660 and 1707
During this time (between the Restoration of Charles II and the Treaty of Union) the social and moral strictures of the Puritan Reformation fell away
There was a renewed sense of freedom in society, with a flourishing of culture and the arts
This was the great age of the first coffee houses - where people met to talk, discuss and do business
It was also a time of scientific advancement - The Royal Society was founded as the Western world's first public research institute
The ideas of Newtonian physics were changing how we understood the world: we could see things in terms of predictable cause and effect, not random acts of God's will
Sir Christopher Wren was rebuilding London
Journeys of trade and discovering were opening people's horizons
London got a proper stock exchange - The Royal Exchange - transforming the economy from an essentially agrarian one to one in which money could be moved and invested
Politically, the long-running dispute between King and Parliament, which a generation before had brought about civil war, came to an end
The moderate compromise reached by the Glorious Revolution of 1688 laid the foundations for peace, stability and prosperity - as well as imperial expansion
It really was the crucible in which modernity was forged
I'd go see what really happened to that lost Roman legion
Probably around 2,000 years ago when the Picts were around
There's virtually nothing known about them at all or their language, so even though it's not like anyone would ever be able to go around and communicate at all it would still be cool as hell just to see them operate and do whatever they might have done
The only things they've left behind (from what I know anyway) are carvings in caves/stone monuments, jewelry and some of their bones
I know the Spanish national anthem's lyrics off by heart
Scottish, Irish in both Irish and English, Welsh’s tune, the British one, the French in lyrics, German tune, Swedish tune, Italian tune and the Russian lyrics(soviet words from memes)
Not really
I'm the one who's usually being misunderstood lol
I struggle with some Glaswegians - I think it's the speed they talk at rather than the accent itself
Dialects are a different matter; folk from Shetland have a similar-ish accent to my own, but the dialect is beyond me
Where you from pal
It's alright, even if you're from Peterheid
There's an old Yiddish cliché that "a language is a dialect with an army and a navy".
The implication here is that the army - and Swedish state in general - conducts all its business in Swedish, therefore Älfdalen is just a dialect of Swedish
When I was young it snowed every year at winter, until a few years ago it hardly ever snowed, now it’s snowing more often
Not really common at all, it wouldn't be surprising at all if we went a whole year without it
Quite a bit it just doesn’t set
We get snow in random points too, we’ll have nothing in January or December and then snow in May and June
It’s snowed more times on my birthday (mid April) than Christmas Day
Whereabouts in Scotland are you based
I'm in Glasgow and last winter was the first winter with no snow that I can remember since I moved here
Fife
To be fair the weather is really boring and mundane on the east coast, how much snow are you experiencing on the west coast
And how long ago was it since you've moved
I've been here four years; moved down from Aberdeen where it snows in summer (I exaggerate
slightly)
In the UK it is the same as Kosovo, but in most of Europe I believe it’s the other way round
Here we do the same thing I think
Example, a thousand and twenty three pounds and fifty four pence would be written as £1,023
Try writing documents to any ISO standard and having them reviewed by someone from continental Europe
This
I thought I was the only one that did it this way
I was taught this way in Scotland and it weirds people out whenever I use it lol
It is weird, I've never seen that before
My P7 teacher taught us to use it because of something like other countries using it
It was many years ago so I don't remember
All I know is that it stuck with me and I still use it
Brazilians used the Portuguese variant until recently, I still hear the elderly use it at least
It's interesting to know, I'd never used before or really seen it
Almost everyone I know is an atheist, so it’s kinda seen as the default
It’s usually weirder to meet a religious person than an atheist, and it’s especially strange meeting a religious person who actually follows the rules of their religion
No one really cares if you're Atheist or not, at least not in my experience anyway
The most extreme it'll ever get in regards to religion is most likely gonna be Celtic v Rangers which is essentially Catholics v Protestants
I’ve always been confused about religion in Ireland, cause I’ve always had the idea of Ireland as being really religious, but your prime minister is gay, so what’s up with that
Is it just that the religious people are really strongly religious but a lot of people just aren’t religious at all, or do I just have a really warped view of Ireland

The usual go to for Unionists in Scotland & England is to call Sturgeon "Wee Jimmy Krankie"..
[here
tory is pretty much synonymous with cunt, i stand by my original comment
I've been wondering about that too
Vile personality, not even attractive
Must be the money
I've heard both *-pest* and *-pesht*. It seems to depend on the individual here
I've never heard pesht at all before, but then again it's not like I encounter mad budapes(h)t fanatics that are always saying the name
I say *-pesht* and *chor-ee-tho*, but avoid using the local name in English if the English language name is different, e.g. Moscow, Warsaw, Cologne etc
I was over on Budapest for the Scotland game a couple of years ago, so that's where I was hearing loads of Scots saying it*.
*Except the persistent handful of dafties that kept saying Bucharest instead - thankfully their pals had arranged the flights
Russian, Arabic, and Mandarin
I've been gifted Dostoevsky books (in English) but I'd love to read them in actual Russian, I feel like translations can never do the author true justice
Mandarin because it's writing system and tones are completely alien concepts to me
I don't think I'd ever learn to actually speak this language through conventional means
Arabic because I really want to delve deep into the heartland of /r/arabfunny
Korean, Yiddish, and then Russian
I have lots of Korean friends and we all communicate in our second language so it'd be nicer if there was no barrier, Yiddish for heritage and being able to read interesting historical documents, and Russian because I study Eastern Europe
French - I know quite a bit of French already but id love to be fluent
Mandarin - I'm learning it at the moment and it's such a fascinating lanaguge and chinese culture is is so interesting
Gaelic - just for the culture and the heritage even though it would be pretty useless
Why are you planning on moving to the Faroe Islands
Sounds like an interesting tale
Both the UK and RoI don't routinely arm all police, because we kind of want to remove that antagonism (I think one of the Irish respondents said it came after the Irish Civil War for them and they understandably wanted to remove firearms from how the government interacted with its citizens there to help heal and have police as part of the community; while in the UK it wasn't really needed before the Brixton Riots and the many police reforms after the many riots caused by antagonistic \*unarmed\* police behaviour meant that the focus was placed on community involvement and cooperation - 'policing by consent' is the common term used here - instead of further widening the divide and distrust by arming them)
Or simpler put, they aren't strictly necessary for the vast majority of police functions in the UK or Ireland, they provoke distrust when they do become more common (from the [Press & Journal] a Highland newspaper, 'constituents have been in touch to say that on encountering police officers in shops or on the streets or at charity events, they do not feel safe', and from the [BBC] 'the population want to see a community-based police service, not a routinely-armed police service')
It's just not part of the culture here, and in a way how we distinguish our police from our military: the police work for us, so here it feels ominous if they are routinely armed as if in opposition to us
But this is probably helped by never having really been much of a thing in the British and Irish isles other than in the exceptional case of Northern Ireland
We call it Armed Response, because its a response that's armed
They do seem to go full on one way or another, it’s either unarmed or rifles, very rarely something between
Good at keeping crowds from one another to avoid brawls at games, as I understand it
I live in Netherlands now and to say it's excellent is an understatement
It helps everywhere is flat but they basically have an entirely separate road network for bikes
I cycle 5k to work and I share the road with cars for maybe 1km of it and even then that's little quiet suburban streets
Compare that to Scotland where it's hilly, wet and our streets were not designed with cycling in mind from the offset it's a world of difference
Cycling down Edinburghs cobbled streets is not a pleasant experience on a road bike for example
We have a bike share system in Glasgow that is pretty decent but in terms of the infrastructure which allows cyclists to cycle safely it was practically non-existent in Glasgow prior to lock down
During lockdown though, the city council coned off certain lanes on roads that are dual carriageways and then put in more permanent features to ensure cars can't drive in cycle lanes
And it's pretty disjointed at best
Oh, there is two existing cycle lanes that are actually good
But they are opposite sides of the city centre, completely disconnected from one another and only cover a couple of hundred metres of both streets
It's very uncommon in the cities most people walk or take public transport and then driving in the suburbs and rural areas
From Scottish gov:
Car 65%
Walk 21%
Public transport 11%
Bike 2%
Rest other%
It's not too bad for me in Glasgow, but it could definitely be a lot better
Luckily I live on the main national cycle network route taking you through Glasgow
Basically we sit down, have a nice cup of tea and I listen to my Mum and my Grandma’s lovely conversation slowly turn into an angry political debate

In scots (particularly Doric) this a grammatically correct and understood sentence;
"Fit fits aht fit
Fit 1 meaning "what".
Fits meaning "foot"
Fit 2 meaning same as in English to get "what foot does that fit
More so the accent
being Northern Irish living in Scotland this confuses people all the time
if someone asks, for example "Where are the Scissors
" And I say "There they are, there
" It comes out as "Thur Thur Thur
Or "fit fit fits fit fit"
"What foot fits what foot" when trying on shoes
I've never heard it as "fet" mysel
Some people have already answered for the UK so I’ll do Scotland specifically:
•William Wallace
•Robert the Bruce
•Mary Queen of Scots
•Robert Burns
•Bonnie Prince Charlie
• Walter Scott
•Charles Rennie Mackintosh (maybe
Robert the Bruce
William Wallace
Mary Queen of Scots
Rabbie Burns
Charles Rennie MacKintosh
Bonnie Prince Charlie
Macbeth
Robert de Bruce
William Wallace
Marry Queen of Scots
&#x200B;
I think are the most famous
Am I having a stroke or wasn’t Columbus Italian and went to the Spanish royals because the other ones (? Portuguese) weren’t interested
I don't know Mackintosh
I wonder how many know vaguely the name Canmore (Malcolm III Canmore)
I wonder how well known Robert the Bruce, William Wallace, and Bonnie Prince Charlie are in the rest of the UK
I know Wallace got bumped up by a film, but the other two are sort of more prominent here
Braveheart was actually used in my high school history lessons as an example of a terrible ‘historical’ film
I’d put David Livingstone, James Watt, John Knox, John Logie Baird, Alexander Fleming and Alexander Graham Bell into the ‘second tier’ of well-known Scots in Scotland
Selkirk, Liddell, Smith, Clerk Maxwell and Napier not even
close, not for my generation anyway
> I don’t know Mackintosh
Where abouts do you stay ? He’s pretty well known in Glasgow
I vaguely know of the Malcolms but the name Canmore doesn’t ring any bells for me
Thanks
Clearly I’m not misremembering
My brain just short circuited a little reading your comment wondering if I had gone mad, haha
We did the same in second year if I recall
Highlands
Also studied in Edinburgh a long while
No idea what that Mackintosh did
Only Mackintosh that comes to mind is a local lord who owns the Commons and is the patron for an old folks home, but thats definitely not national
Yeah it was around that time for us, during the Wars of Independence block
My teacher fucking hated that film with a passion
I guess it was a bit silly of me to put CRM above many of the ‘second tier’ famous Scots, it was an attempt to shoehorn a well known artist in
As for Alexander Selkirk the only reason I’ve heard of him, without wishing to sound like an American who’s just discovered ancestry
com, is because according to my dad we’re related to him
Never did anything about Robinson Crusoe in school
I’d argue that knowing about prominent scientists and engineers is a bit more niche than knowing about swashbuckling freedom fighters and famous royals
My science lessons in school weren’t really focussed on the history of the subject
James Watt lived and worked in my home town so he‘s well known there
If you visit the national museum you’ll certainly learn about them though
It’s just a guess based upon how I learned about famous figures growing up, its probably different for many other folk
Fair enough, I was trying to include more folk from the arts so it wasn’t just nobles + Robert Burns
He was the most famous Scottish artist/architect/designer I could think of
The Art School building in Glasgow that’s constantly burning down is one of his
Mine did too
I found out a few months ago that the guy is now a convicted paedo so I suppose I'm glad the film bothered him so much
My brother who is into the arts knows him, but it might depend on people being interested in the arts to know him
I thought you meant Wallace for a minute there I was confused haha
I did think about RLS but as authors go I’d say that Walter Scott probably edges it
He did invent the modern shortbread tin Scotland after all
The fucking big monument in Edinburgh doesn’t hurt his fame either
Probably a bit of central belt bias on my part as well
Nah, auld Mr Czemerys
I’m vaguely aware of Ossian
Is it definitely bullshit ? A quick skim of the Wikipedia doesn’t give me a definitive conclusion
If that’s true then it’s a shame
The existing legends were more culturally significant and probably just as interesting
Romanticism is a hell of a drug
"It's not like it's real money" - drunk Englishman, probably
I once knew someone who went on a 10 minute rant about the word knife and all our other silent letters lol
It depends, cases here have reduced to single figures and we haven't had a death in a couple weeks but think it is inevitable folks are gonna bring it back from holiday
Just really worried we have to go back into lockdown
I feel pretty good about it because in Scotland our infection rates are very low and I trust the government will take measures to keep the kids safe
Also kids are the last likely to catch, spread and be badly affected by the virus and education is very important so I think they should go back
I'm not trying to say that education's not important and schools need to be shut forever or anything, but wouldn't kids be the most likely sort of people to catch and spread the virus about
You're giving the government far too much trust
When there was a spike after the pubs in England were opened back up big Boris said he didn't realise that the virus could be spread if whoever had it showed no symptoms, even though everyone knew that from the very start and is literally the entire point in the lockdown
The UK government is a big pile of shit and basically just flat out lie
Don't forget that time Dominic Cummings (Boris' special advisor) broke the lockdown rules to go and see his parents and changed his story about why and then said he drove even farther to test his eyesight out
It's honestly so dumb it's almost funny
I think in general kids spread colds and things a lot but I'm not an expert or anything but from what I've read from scientists the younger you are the less likely you are to spread Covid hence why kids under 11 don't have to social distance
Id rather keep other stuff - pubs etc closed to keep our level low and open the schools and put the kids first
Happy to be wrong though if there is opposing research casue again this is just what I'm reading from others
When Winston Churchill was chastised by a woman saying "if I were your wife I would poison your tea", he responded "if I were your husband I would drink it"
This may not be the exact words but;
>Give a man a fish he'll eat for a day, give him a fishing rod and he can feed himself
Alternatively don't poison the waters, sell his great grandfather into slavery and turn up on your gap year 400 years later talking a whole lot of shite about fish

We have a few but the best is the Duke of Wellington statue in Glasgow with his iconic street cone hat (and last I saw a mask too)
It’s probably [this statue of the Duke of Wellington]
It’s nothing special: a 200-year-old statue of the commander at the Battle of Waterloo, but for some reason people put a cone on his head
The police take the cone down, it’s replaced the next day
On an on for years
They tried raising the platform under the statue to prevent it; there was a protest to stop them
Sometimes it gets political (there was recently an EU flag cone on it), sometimes the horse gets a cone
It’s stupid and fun and that’s Glasgow
the town I live in has J.M.Barries birthplace, the Peter Pan guy, so I guess that counts
In Aberdeenshire, there is a castle every 2 meters
Edinburgh Castle
Òrd in Scottish Gaelic
That could work
But it's pronounced 'orsd', so it has a kind of a soft sound in the middle :)
I'm not sure that hurts it much, a kind of 'st'/'tch' noise isn't very soft
Still sounds a bit like a hammer dropping imo
I hear it more as somewhere between 'orsd' and ''orshd' :)
Possibly a little down to the individual speaker, tbh
Writing down the sounds in English was always difficult, like the 'b' in Alba being a mix of B and P, or for me the final 'g' in Gaidhlig curling up from the G noise to make a 'cuh' noise are the roof of the mouth like in 'crack'.  We're probably squibbling over basically the same noise, such with more or less emphasis depending on the speaker
Sort of like how some say Alba like 'Al-ah-pa' while others flatten the middle vowel so it sounds more like 'Al-uh-pa'.
Indeed :)
Fuck knows but I'm pretty fucking skint with a lot of 0's in my account

Well the south is pretty urbanised and the north is one of the most rural parts of Europe

I was talking about vanguard_SSBN, who has a UK flair, not an England flair
>u/All-Shall-Kneel didn’t. And, with respect, most of you wants to leave the UK anyways (which is totally your call
Frankly I’m jealous)
We had a pretty high profile vote that says we don't.
What's the overall attitude in your country like towards men peeing in public
As an example answer: in mine, it's expected that you are super discreet about it, to the point that it would be hard for someone to accidentally see you doing it
Like, it's expected that your whole body (not just the parts that obviously should be kept hidden) is completely hidden from view and you're at least ten metres away from the path so that no-one can hear it
Of course, not everyone follows that, especially if they're drunk, but they tend to get dirty looks from members of the public - and, if they're exceptionally unlucky and the police happen to be nearby, fined
Sorry about them, we don't like them back home either
You can go just a few steps off the path if you are completely certain there's nobody else around
Problem is, hiking can be quite popular in some areas and you never know when a quiet walker is just around the corner, especially in the forest
And when they are open, making you pay a pound for the privilege of keeping our streets clean
Oh I'd certainly be surprised if "don't show your dick" wasn't a universal rule at the least
Interesting, I kind of asked this question based on a experience I had in Spain once
So I was out with a couple of guys and all three of us needed to pee
So, they said, let's use this cluster of bushes over here
"Wait, shouldn't we find somewhere a bit more hidden from view
"No, it's fine bro, as long as your dick isn't showing people won't care if they see you doing it
Al dente or Al throw it in the trash
Hell yea lad
I had always hated pasta as a child, because I'd only grown up with 'British Bolognese' (which my mother made with peas and carrots in, according to some terrible 1970s recipe)
Then at university I had an Italian flatmate who taught me how to make proper pasta, and proper pasta sources
It's been one of my regular favourites ever since
That's a really good way to describe it
The first time I went to Ireland was  mid-October, it was sunny and the temperature was in the mid-teens but the air was fucking cold, even compared to Scotland
We did this in Peru and I never quite got used to it
Not that bad though
Sounds devine
Scots know about it, because we have shinty and there's an annual compromise match between Scotland and Ireland
He was (acting) horrified because it was going to cost him money, not because it's unusual
he had his military socks on
Yeah, shinty is a pretty modest affair in Scotland, it's strongest in the western highlands/Argyll/Glasgow, but not that popular outwith those areas
/r/JustBootThings haha
Even in English I'd be surprised if competitive spelling was a thing in countries other than America or Canada
It's not a thing here but we watch enough American telly that everyone knows what it is
The whackest competition shows I can think of are mostly from Japan tbh
They're straight up German words towards the end
*Gesellschaft* is German for Society/Association iirc
Meanwhile, it doesn't really matter much, because the Regions and the Communities go on doing their thing
The aim of these 'soft vetos' is not to stop the Government with a majority in the lower house from doing what it whats
They have a democratic mandate and are accountable to the people
The aim is simply to cause the Government to pause, think, reconsider
It's a way of saying 'Wait, are you sure
Maybe you want to rethink that
If the Government says, 'Yes, we are sure', then they must carry the responsibility for that at the next election
What does the "China: Part 2" mean for Luzern
Is there considerably more Chinese immigrants/investments than other cantons
Is that not Norfolk and Suffolk
Lots of places like that in the UK
Makes sense
I was on exchange at UZH in Zurich for 5 months this year and there always seemed to be vast amounts of Chinese and Indian tourists in the city
The UK is making its way back to this shit again
Well I'm in Scotland so the only other countries that are within driving distance are England & Wales, but I assume that's not what you mean :P
Kidding-aside, it is pretty cool that other countries are just a short flight away
My husband was living in Prague back when we were just dating & I was able to take extended weekend trips to visit him every month so the distance wasn't a huge issue for us
We also went to Bulgaria for a weekend once on a whim, it's awesome to be able to do stuff like that
I really feel for the people who are in a long distance relationship during COVID
Up here in Scotland we've got things a little different from those that on mainland Europe, but it's still pretty amazing
I can hop on a flight and an hour and a half later I can be in Amsterdam or Hamburg
3 hours later I can be in Malaga or Munich or Krakow

The tap itself makes no difference to the delay
Biased opinion from someone who doesn't drink, but I wish we had more of a café culture than a pub culture
Also wish we had more flats with balconies, but seeing as most people here would rather live in houses with their own garden, it makes sense that balconies aren't that big a priority
I want this so bad
Some cities have pay as you go bikes, but then offer no actual lanes on which to use them
A lot of cyclists around where I live frequently cycle on the sidewalk (which is illegal) cause the roads just aren’t safe
Glasgow had a pretty comprehensive tram network once upon a time but the geniuses in the city council completely scrapped it in favour of building two separate motorways that dissect the city
Young people cooking less is a problem that's growing all over the world, it's just growing faster in the UK because of the abundance of ready meals and such
My ex is French - supposedly a country with a strong gastronomic culture - he doesn't know how to cook
First thing I'm going to do when I get my own place is install one of these
Cobbled streets are a pain to drive on, and a literal pain in the arse to cycle on
Old houses and flats have terrible insulation and windows let in so much wind through the edges of the crappy sash single glazed windows - it's very unpleasant
Hard to heat as a result
Mice are a thing that some places just can't get rid of
Typically extremely expensive just by virtue of city centre and lots of places having stuff like period features
Roads being too small honestly isn't really a downside as we need less cars in cities as it is
Unless they’ve replaced the windows it does
And most don’t replace the windows
ABT - anyone but Tories
Vote for whoever is going to keep the tory candidate from winning
In the vast majority of seats that means SNP, though there are a couple where people vote Labour/Lib Dems because they're in a better position
This answer doesn't fit exactly with the question but Scots does seem to be fading away each generation even if it's just word by word
Looking on older generations (from my experience) I hear words that aren't used among younger people anymore like gan for go, ingins for onions and stuff like that, and then looking at the younger generations you notice some aren't using words even their parents are using around them or just reverting to how they hear Americans on tv talk
An example of this would be one time when my niece was going about saying trash can, and my other one goes about saying tomorrow like tomarrow how Americans say it but I'm sure she'll grow out of it
I remember my little cousins dad was on about his jaikit/jeckit, however you wanna spell it (jacket) and his son had absolutely no clue what he was even talking about
Literally even his own name, tyler, he was being told by his friend it wasn't pronounced like "tiyler" and it was "tahyler"
Guising
It's like our equivalent to Trick or Treating, but rather than just turning up at someone's door and expecting/demanding stuff you have to earn it with something like a shite joke, singing a song etc
The traditional thing to say when you're out guising is "Do you want any guisers
" rather than "Trick or Treat". A fairly minor change all things considered but it's a shame to see us going the American way
We also used to carve turnips rather than pumpkins
Granted pumpkins are easier to carve but I hate the smell of them, at least neeps aren't too bad
Same here
It's really rare to find a fluent gàidhlig speaker under 50 who speaks it from birth
Absolutely this
Scots gets more and more Anglicised and also more Glasgow influenced, "wean" is overtaking "bairn" further from Glasgow all the time
I know there’s a lot of schools in Glasgow for Gaelic
Hopefully numbers start to grow again
I guess that's what happens when only 1 standardization gets shoved in your face all the time
Even some poet from fife went about and made a poem on weans instead of bairns
Len Pennie
I think Welsh managed to keep itself afloat because they held bible and church services in the Welsh language, so churches across Wales were able to keep holding services in Welsh
I think so
She's the young one with long ginger hair
She gets a by, she's actually from Glasgow/North Lanark-way, she's just at uni in St Andrews
In Stirling it's mostly just the under 40s who use wean, in Falkirk you even hear it from people well into their 60s. It's a shame, bairn is a far nicer word in my opinion
ohh, I read on a news article that she was meant to be from fife, I guess you can't trust anything now
The locals drive too quickly, and the tourists drive too slowly
Most single track roads in Scotland are well provisioned with passing places, and if two cars meet head on, the one closer is expected to reverse to the nearest passing place
Tourists are encouraged to pull into a passing place if traffic builds up behind them
Blocking a passing place by parking in it is severely frowned upon, but of course, many people still do
Just drive at a fairly normal speed until you get to a corner or blind spot in case there’s a car
If there is a car one of the cars has to reverse until they get to a passing place, then the other car goes ahead
portugal wins
I felt my shoulders closing in on myself just from going through in google maps
Flower of Scotland is the national anthem and Scotland the Brave is a close second but very similar in tone
I’d go for [‘Caledonia’ by Dougie MacLean
] It is essentially a love song to Scotland about being away and feeling like your losing that connection so coming home
Not Irish myself, but surely “Come out ye black and tans” is up there
For us it’s probably 500 miles by the Proclaimers, or Loch Lomond
Auld Lang Syne, Scotland the Brave,Loch Lomond and 500 Miles
Caledonia is a great song, but it's quite miserable for a national anthem
I'd prefer Scotland the Brave since it's so rousing (and can be played on the pipes)
Auld Lang Syne as well surely
Germany has a region called "Ostwestfalen" which translates to eastwestphalia
Sutherland is in the north
Although it was a southern land for the Norse who raided and settled there and the name stuck
*Coatbridge Sunnyside* train station
I'll make a proper dinner at least four days a week, as for sleep it depends on work
I'm currently working some overtime so I'm not sleeping anywhere near enough but normally I'm not so bad
Yeah I generally have time for all of that
Even with a faster pace of life pre-Covid I still managed to get them in
The ubiquity of kilts is a relatively recent phenomenon in Scots life
For my dad's generation, kilts were generally associated only with soldiers, folk singers and the royal family playing at being highlanders
Even into the 70s, Scotland fans very rarely wore kilts to matches, and weddings and graduation ceremonies were conducted in normal smart clothing
Scotland fans adopted kilts in the early 80s, to distance themselves from violent football subcultures like skins or casuals, and from there kilts have spread and are now widely seen at both informal and formal events in both Highlands and Lowlands
The trick is to put a ball in the middle of that fight, and a goal in the middle of each village
Then you've re-invented medieval 'mob football'.
I absolutely love wearing my kilt
Any excuse
Another one I would add is the tradition of [keeping a traffic cone on the head of the statue of the Duke of Wellington in Glasgow]
[Picture]
We don’t have that many cities but the highlands and islands are a different planet
London
I come from Glasgow, the largest city in Scotland, and even it feels like a small town compared to the UK's capital
Also London has a different accent, way more diversity of cultures, it's far more chaotic and expensive and it's warmer
Not a city, but out of Scotland Stornoway and Lerwick are probably the most foreign feeling for me, just because they're so far away (and Stornoway speaks Gaelic)
Glasgow and Dundee always came across as the most typical of Scotland - Edinburgh has a very historic centre as does Stirling, Perth has a strange layout, Inverness is pretty remote, and Aberdeen doesn't look like any other city in Scotland
The consensus on this thread seems to be that the capital is the most atypical, generally because they have the most foreigners and are the most ‘international’.
This is a bit disappointing as I would imagine most people are more interested in finding out about an unusual place rather than finding out that capital cities are unusual
In my travels through the UK, it’s hard to say for sure but the first one that came to mind was Bristol
I have only travelled through the city by train but it felt different to the rest of the UK because the houses were painted in pastel colours
There is a lot of variation in building materials across the UK and there is a tendency to use local stone, brick or concrete but Bristol is the only place I’ve been here where most of the houses were painted in bright colours like blue, pink and yellow, which I have always associated with sunny foreign countries
I’d love to visit it again
I haven’t been to most of Wales or Northern Ireland though, which I expect feel even more different to Scotland
I don’t know the most typical place in the UK, but for Scotland I would say Falkirk
It’s between Edinburgh and Glasgow but feels like it’s own place, there are a few tourist attractions but it’s otherwise pretty average
Glasgow is the only city that feels like a 'big city' (and even then, not as much as the natives *think* it does), so it feels very different to the rest of Scotland
Visited Lugano as a kid and I thought it felt distinct from Italy
it was very polished, very expensive
it didn’t feel Italian to me
Unfortunately I haven’t had the opportunity to see other parts of Switzerland, so can’t say if it’s truly Swiss
but not Italian
I think Scots should be the linga franca because then I wouldn’t have to be worried about having a few drinks and becoming incomprehensible to anyone not Scottish
It’s one thing speaking the universal language of English it’s another ball game being a little pished and thinking your still speaking it but actually slurring away in your own dialect
Can we just agree it's none of the potato languages
Damn made me laugh out loud got funny looks for it
Can one up you there
Everyone should use Scottish Gaelic; less than 60,000 people can speak it fluently and there's only about 2 million people that speak any closely related language
So essentially have Tolkien write every government document
Can we do it in an exaggerated accent, like in Norsemen
In the interest of fairness the standard Scots should be Shetland Scots so there's that extra Nordic influence
Strč prst skrz krk
not voting for independence 5 years ago is really sucking right now
The whole Panama expedition thing was a terrible idea, terribly executed
Voting no in 2014
The act of union 1707
[The Darien Scheme] is by far our country's biggest mistake and the effects are still very much being felt today
If that hadn't failed the entire world would honestly be completely different since Scots wouldn't have been in the same positions that they were in within the British (likely English in this scenario) Empire
"Alright so let's invest a third of the total money in circulation in the country into a far off colony in a hostile place with relatively little potential for any immediate return on investment already claimed by a much power powerful country, let's do this without any experience in setting up colonies and with every other country we have diplomatic relations with telling us not to, let's also do this when our biggest ally (who kind of rules us but not technically yet) is going to economically blockade us if we do succeed in setting up this colony and our biggest ally is also ramping up for war against our previous biggest ally that we'll definitely be drawn into
&#x200B;
"What do you mean they all died of malaria or got killed by the Spanish and we got nothing back from it creating the largest economic bubble in history
UK: Some would say Brexit, but I'd go a bit deeper than that: failure to re-imagine ourselves as a 'normal European country', and reconstitute ourselves with a modern democratic constitution, after the end of Empire
Brexit is a symptom of that failure
Scotland: Not voting for independence in 2014 when we had a chance
Not dealing with an Indian famine during WWII
not voting for independence
If you just made peace when they said OK and stopped being greedy
Oh carolus
The act of union 1707 wasnae our finest hour either
Yep
I mean, even if it somehow doesn't go through, the last few years have definitely been an ongoing disaster, so definitely an ongoing mistake
Eh a lot of that wasn’t really a mistake
It was clear it was unsustainable and why a lot of it was let go relatively peacefully
[Correct
hahaha aye there's that as well
The country wasn't bankrupt, the merchant class were
The merchant class which formed the majority of the Scots parliament
Which left them susceptible to a bit of bribery when Daniel Defoe came calling

The sun sets at about half past four right now, but to be honest I find it more uncomfortable during the summertime when the sun sets at like nine
Moan, a lot
Its a fuckin pain in the fuckin arse
Im about 56°.
We endure it with the knowledge that in six short months we will have amazing long and beautiful days
Swings and roundabouts, basically
You just do
I would hardly call it polar conditions though
Fairly easily
Bit jarring coming back from holiday to the south in the winter, maybe, especially if you had there before it starts getting dark and then return
But it's not much of a bother, and can actually be quite pleasant and serene
Not exactly polar though: in fact, don't even really have much in the way of snows most of the time now
I want to do one winter at 70^o sometime just to see what its all about - im from the highlands of scotland so i think our days are pretty long winter days compared to the far north
Drinking, mostly
Simple, you can’t get depressed if you’re always depressed
At 57° I got to work when it's pitch black and go home when it's pitch black
It can be depressing
I've just realised I live at the same latitude as Moscow
Feels like it too
:-\
Yep
Moan like fuck multiple times a day to whoever's listening, or just stoically agree with the other cunt that's moaning
I fucking hate it
Every year I go into a mild, downtrodden depression that lasts from October to March
If the roads are icy, I can't use the motorbike
If the wife needs the car, I have to take the BUS to work
Which I despise having to do
Anyway, on a brighter note, we're off to Gran Canaria next month
So it's nice to have that to look forward to, which is an answer to OP's question
Somehow, the poor and rainy corner of Britannia that the Romans did not even bother to annex would end up becoming an industrial powerhouse that built half of all metal ships on earth, at the height of the industrial revolution
It feels like a bit of an arse-pull fanservice on the author's part
We kept the Romans out but couldn’t keep the English out
Pull the other one
You went from
>“Paris vaut une messe"
>I refuse to be King unless this piece of cloth is a specific colour
> A common source of pride and ‘Englishness’ is 1066, the battle of Hastings
This is when a French dude came over and became king of England
Is it a source of pride
I always saw it as being taught in a neutral light, or negative one (the Harrying of the North being portrayed as brutal campaign of terror)
Well, "we" technically weren't around for the Roman era
The Scotii were invaders who replaced the Pictish culture
IIRC the Picts spoke a Bretonnic language (like Welsh or Breton), whereas the Scotii were Goidelic speaking (i.e Gaelic)
Celtic (I might be a bit biased) and Olympiacos
- Celtic
- Olympiacos
[think Celtic’s is very nice ] might be biased tho
Also [I really like AEK Athens logo]
I have always liked the Atlético Madrid badge, but I specifically like the [older version]
Also, I am biased but [Hearts]

I was thinking just give everyone mild alcoholism
Irish Craic, Scottish patter, sounds like a class night out already
Just need the Scousers and thr Geordies now x
I've lived within sight of the [Wallace Monument] my entire life and never been up
Edinburgh is a very touristy city and I've been to a bunch of the stuff that I'm more interested in like the castles (little known fact Edinburgh castle is not the best castle in Edinburgh) but there's also a bunch of stuff I've never been to and probably never will go to as I've only got a couple months left in Europe
Yep, that would be me
Only heard the story about drunk locals after said event, lovely
I reckon that’s to encourage people to buy Historic Scotland memberships as they pay for themselves very quickly (although that’s obviously no good for a tourist
Craigmillar castle as I referenced is a good start
Obviously, the big museum whatever they call it, the national museum of Scotland I think
A lot of people like the Camera obscura
Dynamic earth and the botanical gardens both often get forgotten but they're both good too
That’s awful
I’m Scottish and 20C *is my absolute functional maximum*. The first time I went to Tenerife it was 22C and I cried like a baby thinking I was going to die and had to be dragged by my mum and auntie across the pavement of lava
Earlier this summer I couldn’t go outside when it was 21C. I managed 10 minutes outside before I had to go have a shower and cower behind the curtains like a vampire
You madman
No, actually
It's basically the surface of Venus
Probably the NHS, growing up I always thought that all countries either had completely private healthcare like America or people went to totally free government run hospitals like we do in the UK where in reality most countries use universal public private partnerships with lots of different ad ons and the NHS is something relatively unique to the UK
&#x200B;
Also having a national costume is apparently something that relatively few other European countries do at least in Western Europe, I find it weird that there isn't a kilt equivalent in France, Belgium or the Netherlands though the more east you go the more you find forms of national dress or forms of formal dress that aren't simply a suit
It was the one downside to what was an otherwise class trip to Austria when I last visited
Never tell a Frenchman what Charlemagne was really called
It’s like that in Greece from my experience
I looked it up a couple of days ago when I stumbled on it while visiting Switzerland, it is also apparently sold in the Netherlands
Tastes quite nice, way better than I expected from a milk whey drink
I'll just add that Scotland's Irn Bru (which is everywhere in Scotland and also mostly available in the rUK) and Malta's Kinnie (which I think might only be stocked in shops in Malta, though you can order it through Amazon UK) are other good national soft drinks
I personally wouldn't mind if Rivella, Irn Bru and Kinnie spread over their borders a bit more, more options away from the Coca Cola company
This used to happen in Northern Ireland quite a lot
If the glass is being recycled rather than reused then plastic is actually better environmentally
The extra resources to melt and shape the glass again as well as the extra weight during transportation makes glass a marginally worse material
The best is glass reuse schemes but they are pretty rare
Here in Scotland our home grown soft-drink producer Barr's (of Irn-Bru fame) used to reuse their bottles with a small deposit but it was barely utilised and costing the company far too much
They ended up stopping it about 5 years ago
I think you can decrease that down to England (and maybe Wales and N.I.)
Cod is rare as fuck in Scotland with Haddock being the default fish
Oh well that's something I didn't know
Was talking with a Dutch acquaintance back in my uni days who said yous didn't.
Do you wear it at weddings

Live for a decade in France
Learned to make bread seven years ago
Make bread every week
Still go to the Boulanger for bread because French bread is the greatest thing you will ever taste
Silly Serbian person
Finally, we've found one thing where Hungary is not the odd one out
Dude, it's the exact same in Scotland
Yeah, was sure there were more, just haven't visited those countries yet, so was not familiar with them
Still, be better to have them spread about so we all have way more selection and more varied drinks
Plus I really just wanted to talk about Kinnie, cause damn do I love that drink
One of the versions started in the Netherlands if I remember the article, then came to Switzerland a year later
Might have been the low calorie one
I do remember that all the Rivella apart from the Dutch ones are made in Switzerland, while the Dutch use concentrates sent from Switzerland to make theirs, or something
Something odd about it, anyway
We've opened up a bit more about it in recent years
Although it annoys me that an area of Glasgow is branded as the Merchant City, without the city making it clear precisely what (and who
) said merchants were trading
Scotland has autonomy, but England gets upset when we use it
Scotland itself is a devolved nation, but a very centralised one, and moves to devolve more power from Holyrood to the Northern Isles and Western Isles haven't yet gained much traction
Yes but only if we do it in the right way approved by Westminster
Has the power over its own affairs
It’s dragged Scotland out of the EU against its will
Countless Tory Westminster governments even when Scotland had more pandas than Tory MPs
Scotland is getting the short straw
I get the impression our mere existence upsets them sometimes
They're affy sensitive these days
They're not subdivisions
They're countries joined in a union
For now
You can argue almost anything
Right enough
To be honest, I've no wish to impose on Germany - if the people of Germany decide that the mix of Federal-lands, Federal Capital Cities, Free-cities, Free-states and Hanseatic-cities are now countries, I'll happily refer to them as such
Saxony and Bavaria are Free-states, Bremen is a Free-City, Hamburg is a Free- and Hanseatic-city and Berlin is a Federal-capital-City, so not all of them are called countries
The official translation of the *Grundgesetz* uses *Länder
> Those are the names that the Länder gave themselves
Exactly, they don't call themselves countries
> Your point being
That Germany doesn't call them countries, it calls them *Länder* and *Land* doesn't mean country until the German government decides to define it as such and call its component units countries
Your position has changed
It was "we *should* call them countries, now its "we do call them countries".
The official translation of the *Grundgesetz* uses *Land*. Land may well mean country in other contexts, but the official translation of Germany's basic law chooses not to use that context-specific translation, and therefore doesn't refer to it's component parts as countries
The Bundesrat uses "Federal States " in its translation
How it translates is how it's called
If the German government wanted them to be understood as countries, they'd translate it as such
As the UK does
But they don't. So they're evidently happy with the rest of the world not thinking of them as countries
I wish you luck in your campaign changing this - you're clearly passionate about it
> The German government couldn't care less what you call anything
Of course not
But this is about what they themselves call it
> I just think it would be a good idea if we started doing it ourselves
Cool, I hope more folk join your support for the idea
Who knows, one day German officials might agree with you
Good luck
I currently have a pair right next to me, though I use them for embroidery and when using a sewing machine
Haven’t seen them used as medical scissors tho
I'll just join in with the other Scottish person here (hiya) to say we have a decades-old pair in the kitchen drawer here
I've always known Fiskars to be an excellent manufacturer of scissors
We'd have an alliance independent of the UK
I'm pretty sure the English made us
Viva la Auld Alliance
Napoleon was a leader not a despot
You can be I'm charge, and be a despot
You can be I'm charge, and be a leader
The two are not compatible
Your either a despot telling others what to do, or a leader, showing others what to do
I'm currently a language assistant in a bilingual school in Spain, a role which basically would entail being a support teacher to the regular contract staff - in normal times
My job as it is now has me filling the role of full time teacher, for about 60% of my school time
That is to say I'm left alone with classes to work through entire curriculum based textbooks
This is my first year and tbh its hard work trying to fill the role and responsibilities of someone far above what I was brought in to do
I worry about the students, I don't know how effective the administration expects me to be but I fear every day that I'm not doing a good enough job for these kids who already missed so much contact time last year
I'm not given much support in my job either
I find it very hard to motivate them and speak with authority on certain topics as its literally the first time I've seen the resources, and so I'm trying to incorporate extracurricular materials I am familiar with to fill the gaps
This of course makes me worry about if I'm preparing the students well enough for exams, as I don't even know what they'll contain ahead of time
I'm trying to get them motivated, something very difficult these days, but to what end I don't know
This corner cutting by having me fill that role, or filling of staffing gaps as it might be, can only have a detrimental effect to the students
We have *clootie dumplings* in Scotland, although they're a bit different to the Central European ones, as the fruit is mixed through the dough, and not in a pocket in the middle
It sounds similar
Clootie dumplings are boiled to make them soft and dumpling-like
Is Kletznbrot baked or boiled
Edinburgh Castle
Although I might be biased as I’m from Edinburgh, but I can’t think of any other building as iconic
We have a fuck ton - But I might be biased
- Wallace Monument
- Stirling Castle
- Edinburgh Castle
- Armadillo
- Science Tower
The Sagrada Familia also heavily inspired Geonosis in Episode II
From an outside perspective, maybe the church of our lady in Bruges
By rights I should probably be arguing in favour of Stirling Castle instead because I'm biased
However, Eilean Donan castle is probably more what foreigners have in mind when they think of iconic Scottish buildings, it looks far better on a shortbread tin than either Edinburgh or Stirling Castles do in my opinion
I'd have gone with the Forth Bridge
I think the forth rail bridge, the Wallace monument, and the parliament are all decent shouts, but Edinburgh castle is still probably top of the list
From Edinburgh myself but I'd say the Scott Monument
I have a shoebox full of entry certificates somewhere
I think Italy has a bit of an advantage when it comes to iconic buildings
Well yes
However, I was speaking from a Scotland point of view
Elizabeth Tower and Westminster are so iconic they don’t even need to be mentioned
As a foreigner who has visited Norway it's definitely your landscape I think of first
There are plenty of cool buildings out there but they're nothing compared to your fjords and mountains in my opinion
I think it's hard to beat the big fuck-off castle on a rock in terms of distinctiveness in Edinburgh, especially since you can see it from halfway across the city
On the other hand, the Balmoral looks like just about every other building on Princes Street
Edinburgh Castle has elevation and, well, it's a castle and the biggest tourist landmark in Scotland
Put shortly, if you showed 100 people a silhouette of Edinburgh Castle and the Balmoral Hotel, far more people would recognise the castle
I mean yes, standing on the hill nearest to the clock tower will make the clock tower more prominent, but we're talking about Edinburgh as a whole, not the small area closest to the Balmoral
If I'm sitting down at Newhaven, Ocean Terminal is the most obvious landmark, it's obviously not an iconic part of Edinburgh
Old Raleigh road bicycle that rattles, but still gets job done is what I use
Looks a bit like a banger, but mixed with good locks and surrounded by more expensive/fancy bicycles with bad locks, it has survived without incident, which is always a plus
I think most people would commute with road or hybrid bicycles, though in the Highlands I've known a few (and did for a bit myself) use mountain bikes, just by virtue of the cheapest mountain bikes here tended to be cheaper than their road and hy rid counterparts, and the benefit that you could take them to a trail or a mountain downhill path on the weekend
But if you're purely doing road commutes, it'll be a road bike or a hybrid
(Also, I always get co fused by Americans calling it 'biking', that puts motorcycles in mind, 'motorbiking', while pushbikes are 'cycling'.)
1320-1707
That's largely it
Theought the rest of history we've been consistently fighting off outside invasion from either the Anglo-saxons, Vikings, or Romans
* \~498 (Founding of Kingdom of Dál Riata, Kingdom of Alba founded around 843) - 1292 (John Balliol swears allegiance to England)
* 1314 (King Robert 1st establishes de facto independence)- 1651 (Cromwell invades)
* 1660 (End of first union with England) - 1707 (Act of union with England)
&#x200B;
EDIT: Added Dál Riata
1320-1707
763-1296, 1328-1707
Same here
What about old Bohemia
Where do you get the 763 date from
Well not 2020, maybe 2025 but even that's assuming a yes vote in an upcoming referendum which right now seems tenuous
I think we will be independent within my lifetime though
James VI you heretic
James the 1st isn't involved in any of what I said, he's got nothing to do with the independence of otherwise of Scotland
And are you seriously saying that Scotland is occupying England right now
Earliest date of nationhood in terms of Dal Riada
843 is the formation of alba
What do you mean by nationhood though
Dal Riada was founded around 498
Well I'm saying we're no longer independent which y'know, is pretty hard to argue against
Hoi An
Overcrowded, Disneyfied
This is a perfect comment on Athens
Great city
As a former barman (in Scotland), my first thought would be to ID someone who said that
Sounds like a 16-year-old’s first time in a pub
Once that’s sorted, I’d happily oblige
If they wanted the cheapest whisky, though, I’d maybe encourage them to spend a few pence more, because the gap in quality between something like Claymore and something like Black Bottle is far more than the gap in price
I don’t think they would bat an eye here in Scotland, but we are known for being stingy
We did a bit on the Romans and Celts, focussing more on the Romans, in primary school despite not living in a place with any real Roman presence
I was at school from the mid-'90s to mid/late '00s. We've always had a separate education system though
I think primary teachers get quite a bit of freedom with what they teach, I suppose Romans are easy to find information on and pretty interesting as well
We say haich too, we even have Gary Haich a popular Scottish export:
Turkey and Cyprus
Too hot for my pale wee gaìdhlig body to deal with
No not really, there are a few countries I have very little interest in visiting but the only countries I genuinely would never consider visiting would be places where my visiting there would potentially aggravate even to a small degree existing human rights problems, with the possible exception of Belarus (which I have visited) there aren't really any of those countries in Europe
I'll take your word for it
I mean, I sort of get it, Ireland is sort of one of the places I'm less enthused to go to
I would be up fot a jaunt over there, but I'm perhaps a bit more wary, especially as friends with family there have said it can be a pain to get about if you can't drive, which is a problem if you're more interested on visiting places outside of capitals, like myself
Yeah probably gonna give Greece a miss too tbh
Probably
I hesitate to say yes as I haven't visited either part of the island, so I can hardly make a definitive statement
I think to a degree it's the presumption of that and also the fact you can't take a train there, as I have with Wales and England, so once you get to that point where you are flying, you also sort of want to go farther afield
That said, I wouldn't mind going there, just nothing really drawing me and as I said, I've been told it gets a bit more difficult on public transport once you leave Dublin, especially the West
Timbuktu is what springs to mind
Not as interesting as any of the others here, but I grew up on a remote island where almost everyone works fishing, in a fishery, or crofting
The livelihood is essentially kept alive by a healthy mix of the military and tourism, so every summer our single track roads are always filled with camper vans and tourist coaches
So one day, me and my mate were our local shop getting our dinner before going off to Cadets and the shop was absolutely packed with all of these American pensioner types
This is important for later, that the shop is called locally as Nellie's Shop because the last owner was a man named Neil MacLellan, and now his son Ronald runs it
However the name on the front of the shop is MacLellan's Supermarket
One group stuck out like a sore thumb as they were circling Ronald with these absolutely adoring faces, like he was their hero or something, and all me and my mate could hear was one of them ask him; "are you the real life MacLellan
". The two of us could not stop laughing from the other end of the shop at such an absurd question, and we found out later that they thought MacLellan wasn't a real surname and that Ronald was some movie star they had seen back in the States in some classic American movie that romanticised Scotland (haven't been able to figure out which movie it is yet)
Not according to these folks
No didn't see or hear anything about it
I mean other than perhaps Macau there isn't a lot of serious competition is there
We have four police forces in Scotland:
- Police Scotland, the national civilian police, who cover both urban and rural areas alike
- British Transport Police - the civilian railway and ports police (airports are policed by Police Scotland)
- Civil Nuclear Constabulary - who protect nuclear power stations
- Ministry of Defence Police - civilian police who police the environs of the nuclear submarine base at Faslane
The only Military Police here are the Royal Military Police, the Royal Navy Police/Regulators and the RAF Police
These are only responsible for policing on military installations and mostly for making sure service members behave, and have *no* responsibility or powers over civilians outside of military bases
There is no Gendarmerie/Carabinieri equivalent here
My area has 6 police forces
Police Scotland which is just the standard police force for civilian uses
Ministry of Defence police that protect the big military base in the area
Civil nuclear constabulary which protects the place where warheads are stored
Royal Military police which police the army and just arrest soldiers that got to drunk while out in the towns and the Royal Navy Police who do the same thing for sailors
And we also have the British Transport Police who are at train stations and go on the trains on the weekend and stuff like that to prevent crimes for happening
Only police Scotland arrest civilians with the other forces only detaining people before giving them over to the normal police to deal with
Same
Three bobbies stretched over a pretty large peninsula here
Still Police Scotland, not some miltary group
It didn't really make a difference
Initially, policing got worse, as there was a feeling that the new national force introduced aggressive urban policing into rural areas where that was unnecessary
There was also an issue where the Glasgow Chief Constable - who had a very puritan worldview - enforced aggressive policing of the sex trade in Edinburgh, where previously they'd taken a more "observe and protect" *laissez-faire* policy
Things calmed down eventually, and some savings were made from having a single national administrative function
The crime rate in Glasgow has improved, but that's more to do with the police and health services agreeing to treat knife crime as both a crime issue and a public health problem
Glasgow has a gang problem; Foggieloan does not
The two places need different policing techniques to solve different problems
By skipping most of it
I'm a history buff but even I have a lot of periods of Scottish history I really don't know much about
There's just too much, we're one of the oldest countries in Europe and there's just been a bunch of complex stuff going on
We did the Scottish Wars of Indpenance for 3 years, and the Darrien Scheme up until the Highland Uprisings for one year
The rest was WW2
Here you can leave after:
Fourth year - 15/16 - you won't be going to uni unless you go to college and get an HNC/HND
Fifth year - 16/17 - some people go to uni after this year
Sixth year - 17/18 - most people that go to uni will leave after this year
It can be 17 or 18, depending on the courses you choose in school, and which course you choose at university
Students can leave secondary school after 5th year with Higher qualifications at 17, or stay on for an extra year to sit Advanced Higher qualifications
Some university courses will accept entrants with Highers, others require Advance Highers
The way the school enrolment system works in Scotland, some people can be 17 when the leave high school after completing all six years of secondary school and still be 17 by the time they start university
For most people who are going straight from school to university they will be 18 though
You can go to university at any age technically in Scotland
However most people are 17/18
However it is possible to go at 16
That's kind of wild, I'll graduate just after I turn 21
By the sounds of things it's actually kind of similar in France and Scotland
The way the enrolment system works in Scotland is from 1st of March until the 28th of February
For talking's sake, let's use an example of kids born between March 1994 and February 1995
They were scheduled to start primary school in the August of 1999
The kids born between March 1994 and August 1994 would have been 5 by the time they started school and the kids born between September 1994 and February 1995 would have been 4
The school year finishes in late June in Scotland
So those kids born between March 1994 and February 1995 would have completed 13 years at school (7 years primary school, 6 years secondary school) in June 2012
The kids born between March and June 1994 would leave school aged 18 and the kids born between July 1994 and February 1995 would leave school aged 17
Norway has three land borders, two of which are with neutral countries, the other with the successor state to the country NATO was founded in opposition to
In Scotland there’s been a sense of solidarity with Catalonia from some of us who support Scottish independence
Clara Ponsati fled here following the ‘unofficial’ referendum
Here’s a recent BBC article regarding her extradition
I think Madrid has been trying to charge numerous other Catalonian politicians with treason
In my opinion it’s awful and Catalonia should be allowed an official referendum on their independence like Scotland was
Yes, I know and as a Hungarian I should imagine you’re well placed to say that
However, the right to self determination is what really matters
Very interesting response, thanks
I’d assumed (perhaps wrongly) that the Catalan nationalists and SNP were comparable but perhaps not
You’re right, the SNP are a progressive socially democratic movement focused on being pro-Scottish rather than anti-English
Evidenced in the fact that I was born and initially raised in England before moving to Scotland as a teen and am staunch SNP voter these days
However, I must agree with the German poster who rightly stated, it is easier to be a democratic movement when you’re allowed a referendum
Madrid made a big mistake there and internationally we looked on with shock
I’ve never heard anyone propose that
Doesn’t sound like a nice idea to me
There are always winners and losers in democratic votes, that’s simply the nature of democracy
There’s little militancy to the movement in Scotland and I doubt it would progress to it but I suppose it’s an unknown scenario
Unlike Spain we don’t have a formalised written constitution, nor one banning the freedoms yours appears to
It’s based on having a mandate for a referendum and the SNP continue to be the largest party in Scotland, both via Holyrood and Westminster supporting that mandate
You quote these polls as if it strengthens your argument when actually it shows they are very close and there is massive support for independence in the region
Just because other countries have similar laws doesn’t make it right
If you’re so sure of a pro-Spanish victory then have a referendum ffs
Apparently the freedom to hold a referendum
I don’t need to
Im not too sure but I found this on Google about the area of "Stirling"
**"Stirling derives from Gaelic srib-linn, meaning "stream-pool"**
I grew up in a town that's name derives from old Scots phrase for "hidden town" as the town sits in a sudden valley compared to its surrounding which is gentle rolling hills
It's has saved the town from being sacked a few times in the middle ages when the English marched right past it without noticing it was there on their way to Edinburgh
Edinburgh
Edin comes from Eidyn, the name of the place in Cumbric, the Brittonic (Celtic, but not Gaelic) language that was spoken by the Picts before the Scotti (Gaelic, not Brittonnic) took over
The name's meaning is unknown apparently
Burgh is Germanic and comes from Scots and Anglo-Saxon, it means the same thing as it does in English or German and so on (Town or Fortress)
The real reason why they picked Baile Átha Cliath as its Irish name, instead of Dubh Linn, is because nobody wants to be associated with the Blackpool in England
Even if it's in another language, sharing names is embarrassing enough
Imagine being Snot
You could have had a cool Anglo-Saxon name like *Chad*, but instead your parents named you fucking Snot
Hello, I’m currently living in that town
Huh, I always presumed it was because it was on the sea, hence bord eaux
Hi, It was good place to grow up, but I left there more than a decade ago now
It was a little too small and quiet for me
How do like living there
I was just joking about the fact that Blackpool is generally considered to be a bit of a dump by most people in the UK lmao
Strath Clyde, Glasgow, Herriot Watt, St Andrews, Stirling, Dundee
Edinburgh, St
Andrew’s and Glasgow
I always assumed it was to do with the nobility being the law of their own lands, they were always on country estates with witnesses present so it would make sense to  gather them together and make the accusation Infront of the top dog
Most Scots will switch to standard English (albeit with an accent) when speaking to a foreigner or indeed an English person
RP's an accent, not a dialect
Most Britons will moderate their dialect for people if they are struggling to keep up, but they aren't going to put on a fake accent
Standard English will get used or something approximating that
> asking a person from Manchester to speak RP is unthinkable
RP is as much an accent as it is a dialect
A person from Manchester wouldn't necessarily be expected to adopt an entirely new accent, but they would be expected to use a standardised dialect in place of Mancunian, if talking to someone not from the area
I love that about Norway
Even though the law is there to protect dialects is there still a level of prejudice associated with particular dialects or are people generally quite accepting
I was wondering what you meant with the "R" in bath thing until I figured (from my point of view) it would sound more like "bawth" in your accent I believe
As you can imagine, throwing an R in it with my accent would really stick out
>In the US, I've had to put on an American accent when pronouncing 'water' to make myself better understood
Wawdoor
I tend to get on fine with Americans understanding water in my own accent as long as I enunciate the Ts properly
Absolutely no chance with curtains though, that's the one word I've found that Americans can't understand me saying no matter what
Does someone ever talk like that in real life
I always thought it was a weird accent that only BBC presenters and kids in posh boarding schools were made to talk
Aye, curtains is a bit of a niche conversational topic, I'm surprised it's come up at all to be honest
My Irish pal had to translate, they could understand his accent no bother when he said it
I was going to write something like plug types or which side of the road you drive on
And then I realised its literally only really the UK that's different
I wish we were the same as the rest of our continent because I've only ever driven on the left side and I am genuinely shitting myself for the future if I ever have to drive on the right
That's what I was thinking haha
Huh
Well I suppose Switzerland just have to be the odd one out all the time haha
They're not in the EU anyways so it's not really important for them to be the same
Yeah I thought the third one was neutral and the EU 2 holed one was like without any neutral and made it dangerous but apparently they still have a neutral somewhere so idk
As far as I know there's no dumplings in Scotland as per the definition
However we do have a dessert called a Clootie Dumpling
In the West coast of Scotland we have salt and vinegar with our chips, in the east they have salt and sauce, some sort of demonic invention of the eastern heretics
Hating labour for being too Tory like, or hating Tories for being too labour like
Also milk first or cereal first
People are going to say tea first, or boiling some milk, wavering a tea bag in the next room, and calling it too strong to drink
Salted porridge vs
non-salted porridge
"Saat an saas" or "salt and vinegar".
Edinburgh people eat chips with salt and a vinegary brown sauce, the rest of the country eats them with salt and vinegar
I have no dog in the fight, as I prefer chips with just salt
Aberdeen also has the interminable conflict over where the best fish suppers are to be had
The war will never end, as the quality of various chippers waxes and wanes
I used to be a devotee of The Bluebird and The Ashvale, but have to admit that Hass' has overtaken both now
Everyone agrees that the Hilton Fish Bar is gaads though
Its a silly one, it all depends on context
If you're making it in a pot with leaves, it makes sense to pour the milk first so you don't have to do some kind of guessing game with the tea strainer
If you're doing it in a mug, literally no one puts milk in first - the teabag becomes soggy and just eugh weird
Tea in first when making tea
Milk in first when making coffee
What flavour is it
Brown
This is it
I'm on the "è fimmina" side
("It's a she/female/woman", a saying in Palermo)
Oh hell yeah
Sorry, what I mean is:
Coffee, milk, water
For the instant coffee most people would be drinking at home or in the office
Listen, we're busy fighting ON the island about this very important thing without someone putting also the mainland in the mix
Ah yes glorious Af-slut-dick my favourite

They won the geographic lottery in Europe

I respect them for their achievements in art, sciences, war, music, and philosophy
I wish Charles de Gaulle had been born a Briton so he could have been our Prime Minister tbh
Ha ha, for me this country is too much like a postcard
I want to go somewhere that has forests and cool wildlife, with lots of different types of scenery
A Norwegian loves our nature
Huh, I thought we were just the discount version of your landscapes lol
Well, my family comes from the part of Scotland that used to belong to you lot, but you gave it away in a wedding dowry
But you’re from *Norway*. That’s a beautiful country if ever there was one
High praise considering what Norway is like
I was out paddling on a loch today with a half Norwegian friend who mentioned that where we were reminded her of the bit or Norway her mum is from
Admittedly that's probably helped with all the non-native trees planted by the Forestry Commission on the hills around us
I've only been in and around Oslo so I haven't seen "real" Norway if you know what I mean
The loch I was in today is about 145-150m deep at the deepest bit, plenty of space for a monster
Edit: I’m a fanny, 145-150’, not metres, so only like 45m!
Taky se učím češtinu a rozumím.
Not really, no
We're not used to it, and we've also got that Northern European thing where being openly pleased and proud is frowned upon
I think Norway's scenery is like Scotland's without the baby proofing
Almost as if you were to take the rubber protective caps off of the mountains
>we've also got that Northern European thing where being openly pleased and proud is frowned upon
really depends where you are I guess, some people can be too much of that
We're like step-Nordic or something
Nordic-lite
That honestly sounds pretty different from most Spanish folk I've met
Im a proud European but a passport that says "Republic of Scotland" is the dream
Nothing wrong with the queen
It's her government I dislike

Sorry gents but its no jist escaping the tories we're worried about
More than welcome to visit though :)

Nothing against Elizabeth Windsor personally
Its monarchy I dislike
And her government
And tories in general
Good luck gents

It's from the Latin *cuniculus -* which means a rabbit, rabbit burrow or burrow more generally
(More accurately it's from the Ancient Greek *κόνικλος* ( pronounced kóniklos), which is where the Latin term comes from
) Quite a few European languages have words for rabbit derived from this root
Irish has coinín, Dutch Konijn, Italian coniglio, Spanish conejo and English has coney
Who is your country's most disgraced politician
In honour of former Scottish first minister Alex Salmond being tried for 14 cases of sexual misconduct including 2 cases of rape with another 25 or so unproved allegations who is your country's most disgraced politician
Pretty much every First Minister we've had other than Sturgeon and Dewar (RIP) tbh to varying degrees of disgrace
Going back a little bit for that eh
I think they blame that one on Austria
Who's the 1%?
That sounds like one of those poorly worded religious diversity classes we had to take in primary school
His trial date was announced today
He was arrested and charged in January
Unless there's something I don't know about him Varadkar seems pretty decent
Maybe that's in comparison to our overlord being a bumble bee on meth though
What did McConnel do that was so bad other than that affair
Don't remember him that well though
There aren't many people that like him
He wasn't in favour of democracy at all, set himself up as the lord protector and his son inherited the title after him
He was mostly about enforcing a radical (for the time) religious agenda
Jeffery Archer helped fund an African coup attempt perpetrated by a friend of his and went to prison for perjury and perverting the course of justice all while remaining (to this day) a sitting member of the house of lords

Very good and comprehensive answer
Present problems in the south have deep historical roots which were briefly shoved under the carpet from the 80s up until the 08 crisis hit, all thanks to cheap credit which fueled growth booms in all of those countries, growth that didn't result in the creation of wealth-producing industries in most cases due to the nature of the modern day global market, simply put they had zero chance of being able to compete with the already established industrial giants, and industry could (still can) be always outsourced to places with cheaper labour
When credit became scarce those structural problems resurfaced revealing the size of the phantom economy cheap credit had created over the decades, while also having completely obliterated what little industrial wealth-producing assets those countries had in the first place
It's the perfect combination of history, bad policies and the influx of cheap credit that resulted in this current situation
What is needed to solve this is a healthy dose of foreign investment from the EU and a fair amount of regulations (or protectionism) to help create nascent, sustainable industries
The only other option would be for the EU to federalise and implement internal transfers like in the USA, covering for the deficits of those states, essentially turning them into sources of human capital for the industrial north and warm holiday places for northern pensioners to retire to
Yep, the near future, as things stand, doesn't look good
Unless some direct action is taken by a more consolidated EU, with some serious leadership and creative problem solving, it's anyone's guess how things will look 10 years from now
EU is in DIRE need of reform yesterday
It's not just the future of the EU as a political project that's at stake if nothing changes but the fate of its member states themselves

Trump claimed knife crime was so bad that "his friend" told him hospitals were as bad as in a warzone and corridors are awash with blood
He also said there's areas of Birmingham that are no go areas for non Muslims
Utter fabrication
The only kernel of truth in that massive dump of a lie is that the UK is currently seeing a rise in knife crime and there are Muslim community's in Birmingham
Everything else is utter fabrication

Jeremy Hunt recently announced to a Japanese trade delegation that his wife was Japanese - which would have been news to her, as she's Chinese, so I wouldn't expect too much in the way if accuracy from him
I honestly have no idea how he gets away with it
He constantly lies and when he's presented with facts and statistics he has the audacity to scream 'fake news'.
I remember when he got in he was asked about how he felt that that Clinton actually got more of the popular vote than he did
"No she didn't."
Confused looking reporter: "She did
You won the election but Hillary had more votes from the public
"No

The Mueller Repprt explicitly states: "While this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him

Former international development secretary Priti Patel suggesting the UK should threaten to cut off Ireland's food supplies as a Brexit negotiation tactic
Aside from being needlessly aggressive and grossly offensive, it was also utterly pointless, as Ireland is one of the most food secure nations in the world (I wonder why that might be a priority in Ireland
nothing to do with earlier British policy, surely

*Rain is only skin deep*
Usually I just hear it to mean as: "Rain isnt that bad, it only gets to your skin"
But once or twice I've heard it used to say "Bad times can only be so bad"

Yell get a skelp roond the lug: you’ll get a smack around the ear
Yer aff yer heid: you’re off your head (basically, you’re crazy)

22 during the day, 17 at night
i'd say it gets cold at 20 (day)
Genuinely like if it’s 19 outside I’ll be in short and a T-shirt, if it’s 19 inside I’m shivering, it’s so weird
Until I was assaulted in a well-lit outdoor shopping centre last week at 21:00, I generally thought it was very much
A week later wincing around the house with cracked ribs I’m not sure my opinion is so valid anymore
Generally it’s quite fine in the city centre but you always seem to get the radges coming out of the woodwork wherever you go
Do bear in mind that 3 years of regular night walks, this was the first violent incident I experienced though it’s a daily struggle trying to get the addict beggars to leave you alone when they’re begging for cigarettes or telling the most stupid elaborate stories trying to get money off you
Stirling
Most of the town is fine most of the time
There are a few of the schemes and nearby villages that can be a bit of a no-go area but I'm probably safer than most; I'm a reasonably big guy with a reasonably big dog, but not so big that some wee dicks would see that as a challenge
There's a wee bit of the "fuck outsiders" mentality from some in the old pit villages
There are some places I wouldn't want my partner going though, even with the dog
The town centre on a Friday/Saturday night (pre-pandemic) is actually one of the safer places as it's usually packed with police
I'm in Stirling and although we have our fair share of junkies it's a pretty safe area
They won't try to rob you of valuables, but might ask you if you have a spare cigarette, they'll leave you alone when you say no
Which city in Scotland
Depends on who you are and where you are, a 14 year old emo in Hillpark won't be left alone
It could be any
Some of them are so insular it’s unbelievable
My dad was working in Valleyfield, so very much west Fife, not even remote
A guy whose house he was working in couldn’t believe he’d travelled “all the way from Stirling”. My dad asked him “how far away do you think Stirling actually is
”  The guy was convinced it was about a three hour drive away
Hillpark doesn't seem to be as bad as it used to be in that regard, but maybe I'm not enough to attract their attention
Used to be really rough when I was younger, my friend lives on Queen Street and thinks its quietened down big time
I'm not sure if it's calmed down over the years or I'm just too old for it to be as much of an issue nowadays
I've got some family in Hillpark, I'm a bit further out now
Depends how big you are
We have a the bagpipes, no one really knows if it's played really well or really bad
Our City was formerly the capital, home to our ruling dynasty even after that
We have the countries biggest castle and 2 major battlefields are within sight of the walls so it gives plenty to choose from
If I had to pick a definitive one it would be the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314, where Robert I defeated a much larger English army
Yeah, I read an English translation one from 2006

I wonder what Umberto eco would think of it
A house with 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms and 2 living rooms for the lowest offer of £290,000
For about €400k you'd get a bigger 4 bedroom house in a nice area, possibly with a double garage or maybe an older house with some half decent architectural merit
House prices are slightly higher than the Scottish average here, but nowhere near the most expensive
For my area that is the most expensive house I can find

I remember going with an ex-girlfriend to a restaurant in Prague
Both of us were foreign but had lived in Prague for several years
We went into a restaurant near the centre and ordered a meal, and asked for tap water
The waiter told us that the tap water in Prague wasn’t good and suggested that we order something off the menu instead
We told him we would do without, and after giving them some time to start cooking, we got up and left
When the waiter came after us, we told him we were locals and knew the water was fine
The funny thing is, if he had just kept his mouth shut we would have ordered other drinks later on

And how could we forget the refrigerator and flushable toilet two things we couldn’t live without
And one of the most famous Scottish Exports would be Rockstars Grand Theft Auto, and on the topic of rockstar the Pinkerton Detective agency in red dead redemption was founded by a Scotsman
Your country invented the FN FAL the firearm of the free world
>The telephone (screw you Bell, it was our guy alright)
As a Scot I am more than happy to give you guys credit for this
Bell was a grade A cunt of the highest order
A morally bankrupt thief and trickster
In fact we're all pretty happy he moved to the states so we don't have to take "credit" for him
There is a village in Perthshire called Dull
Dull,
It's literally called Dull
I think the village of Lost In Aberdeenshire tops the cake or maybe Shittington
The western isles, the northern isles (they normally go by other better names tbf)
The Highlands and the Lowlands
And of course Clackmananshire
There's a town called dull in Perth and Kinross
Hey, just as an aside, me and a few friends will be going to Dusseldorf in about 6/7 weeks
Can you recommend any good bars to drink in
I've been to Fatty's Irish pub (the Guinness is good there btw) and a couple of pubs on Bolkerstraße, but just looking for some more places that someone who lives there would recommend
And Bland NSW
I can see those yellow vests being a lot more numerous, for sure
I cannot imagine people being okay with potentially entire platforms simply pulling out of Europe entirely
I would laugh at the prospects of the next election but it's clear that Axel and his Government of Who Gives a Fuck are all too rich already to care about their jobs
The EU have officially overstepped their boundaries
The beginning of the end for them is here
The allies won WWII, but Germany won the peace following; the Fourth Reich is real, and it's one step closer to establishing the authoritarian, corrupt, Republic Senate that it has always wanted
I have completely U-Turned on Brexit because of this issue; not the singular issue, of course, that would be misguided as for now, it seems that the benefits outweigh the costs; but the principal that these old men and woman can decide things that will affect all countries under, what should be, a trade union but now seems more like the USSR
I expect, and fully welcome, riots
That’s pretty much their MO
Nigel Farage constantly goes on about the EU doing nothing, wasting money, etc
The man never showed up for votes, neglected his duties as the UKs representative on committees , and only appeared when he needed to generate the latest soundbite for his followers
> So basically they would create the problem and then use it as a strawman
Yes
Look at Nigel Farage's EU attendance record, and then look at how he complains about people in the EU not doing their job
Because like you say, they don’t have the name recognition; I can’t actually think of my local MEP off the top of my head, while I know my MP & MSP
Nigel, meanwhile, is infamous for not bothering to do his job
It depends what you think their job is
If their job is to antagonise Brussels and get us out of the EU then they’re doing brilliantly
If you think their job is to represent us within the structure of the EU and get the best deal for us then I don’t think they are doing that
Compare to the SNP in Westminster - they don’t want to be there, they want to leave, but they still operate within the system and try to get the best for Scotland within the UK, rather than merely be antagonistic
And they definitely don’t (IMO) treasonously call for a foreign government to subvert the will of parliament because he doesn’t agree with them
We have this thing where we deep fry a whole pizza, it’s so good
Yes, but mainly for dipping the crusts into, rather than as an extra topping
> It's nothing special on top: sausage, mushrooms, cheese, bacon
The one thing quite different was that instead of tomato sauce it had garlic sauce on the bottom
That sounds similar to the French/German *Flammküchen*.
Yes
Ah, oops
Thanks for putting me right
Pros: easy access to the great outdoors
Cons: Brexit, Westminster and Tories
Pro: Free Healthcare, Nice People, Free University, Open moderate society, great food and drink
Cons: English rule, getting dark at 3

> Con: the tories hate students and keep raising tuition costs
*laughs in Scottish*
Dutch food was stuck in the 'British food in the 1950s' zone for a long time: national dish is basically sausage with mash-and-cabbage; most other dishes are either terrifyingly bland and tasteless, or deep fried
But now Dutch food is in the 'British food in the 1970s' phase
An excess of low-grade ingredients thrown together without any thought as to taste, finesse or balance
So you'll find things like a burger in a brioche (why
) with salmon, avocado, honey mustard dressing, olives and rocket - as if just piling on different tastes made it better
It's like the whole country is colourblind or tone-deaf, but for taste
As a Scotsman currently living in the Netherlands, I have to say that just about everything else in the country is great
It's just the food culture that's so woefully terrible
Con: The tories are fucking us over too
For Russia: I'm far from being a Communist, but "the Red Army is the Strongest" is such a great song
I also enjoy Farewell to Slavianka and Let's Go
I love 'Hatikvah' (the Israeli national anthem)
It's just such a stirring tune
> I really like "I vow to thee, my country",
Gustav Holst really makes everything better
> The Union version of "down to Dixie"
Hadn't thought of American Civil War songs, but now that you mention it, the Battle Hymn of the Republic is also fantastic imo
Nothing beats the line "As He died to make men holy, let us die to make men free
[Virginia's Bloody Soil is a more somber one, but also very good, especially with Tenesse Ernie Ford's voice] The last stanza always gets me
>And now our hero's sleeping there with thousands of the brave
>No marble slab does mark the place that shows where he was laid
>He died to save our Union; he's free from care and toil
>Thank God the Stars and Stripes still wave, above Virginia's soil
Aye you can
Would get a slap from somecunt putting they tunes on
Worst part is that God save the Queen isn't even from the UK lol, the tune and melody are originally French iirc
If it's any consolation, it's really got nothing to do with that kind of slavery
It's a Whig song about civil liberty
It means not being under arbitrary or tyrannical rule
Poor bastard is perpetually on the YouTube deathbed because of his commentators lol
From Glasgow so it’s a bit divided haha
Obviously there will be houses that play they tunes but they wouldn’t put them on at a party if it was mixed company
Sure it was a dick move, but given how chaotic Rhodesia turned out, it kind of saved them from a shitty long term investment
Shame as liked Liverpool as a city before as well haha
Obviously you habe things like the great fire of london but in terms of somewhat recent years Id be more inclined to say something along the lines of grenfell, the hilsborough disaster, and the 7/7 bombings
May all the victims rest in paradise
From Dundee, Scotland the Tay rail bridge disaster
Happened in December of 1879 where during a storm the bridge fell down into the ice cold water
No one on board survived
Easily the most serious disaster in Dundee's history
[Tay Rail Bridge Disaster]
It was but it set sail from Southampton
So I guess both could claim it if they really want to
HAGGIS
Mostly everyone herehas haggis threw out the year useally on Burns Night or At
Andrews Day
It's not eaten everyday despite some stereotypes that might say that
Easy answer for Scotland
Haggis
Most people have either never had it or don't like it, and those who do like it (such as myself) only eat it maybe 3 or 4 times a year
Burn's Night, St Andrew's Day, and maybe a couple times when you order a fry up and they give haggis instead of black pudding
haggis isn't *never* eaten here but it's a lot less common than what people might think
I already thought people realised that we don't go about eating haggis every day and anyone saying so was just saying it for a joke, but I heard some guy say that haggis is our *staple* food in scotland which it isn't even close to
There is a trdelník place outside Rajská Zahrada metro station in Prague
Only trdelník place I’ve seen outside the centre
Isn’t french onion soup an American dish, only called “french” because of how the onions are chopped
Not every day but definitely a couple of times a week for some people, maybe it depends on your working environment
Working in heavy industry it's sometimes my job to go on the roll run and there are always a couple of folk who want haggis
I have once a week at least
That's what I'm having for my dinner tonight
Well, lobsters might end up getting a lot cheaper now that the creel fishermen are struggling to export to Europe
A full fry-up is a 'once a week' thing, really
Afternoon tea vouchers are a go-to birthday present for mams and grans though
Try Stornoway black pudding next time
Far better than ordinary black pudding, it'll blow your mind
My father used to make a starter salad from Stornoway black pudding, celery and grilled apple on shredded cos lettuce
Fun fact (you don't need to know this) people in Inverclyde call "square sausage",  slice
"Would you like a slice and tattie scone roll
Even worse, I knew one guy from Falkirk that called it "flat sausage".
The Lancashire black pudding has too many fat lumps in it for my taste
Much prefer the Stornoway one
World's highest rate of recorded assaults
If you're a man who lives anywhere that's not extremely well off chances are you'll have the shit kicked out of you at some point
&#x200B;
EDIT:
&#x200B;
Since this has blown up and there are a few people saying they might not come to Scotland as a result I want to clarify a few things
&#x200B;
* As a tourist you're in virtually no danger
* We're not actually higher in rate than places like South Africa and Honduras we just record it better, we're probably higher than anywhere else in western Europe
* Scotland isn't a warzone and things are improving even since those statistics I posted bellow (still number one though)
* Scotland isn't any higher in other crimes than neighbouring countries, we still have the typical low European murder rates and similar stuff
Most assaults are more drunken punching and kicking with relatively minimal injuries
Being governed from Westminster by people who don't care about us
Oh and the trains aren't great
We're at 10pm for all alcohol sales on all days, tbh even though it's a minor irritant I quite like it and would gladly see it pushed back to 7-8pm
Happened to me more than once plus not that surprising when u think that Glasgow had the highest murder rate in Europe for 30 years straight starting in 1965
You make it sound like a war zone
Scotland is one of the safest countries in the world
If you looked into the stats you'd see that the majority of assaults are between under 16s and many many repeat incidences between individuals
You think Scotland is dangerous
Get out into the world, you don't know how lucky and safe you are
Yup [we're higher than South Africa] only place that comes close is our good old brother Northern Ireland
I imagine we're not actually higher than places like South Africa and the Congo and those rates are more due to recording differences but Scotland sure as hell is higher than the rest of Europe
Most of the ones I've seen have been outside the pubs or just after they or a club closed and people have poured out, so aye
Posturing and alcohol definitely increase it
Occasionally one of those two will drop but usually one of them features
Like 99% of all the assaults I've ever seen have been while drinking usually in the 2 to 3:30 am time slot
Am a bouncer though so there's a bit of a reporting bias there
It's the other way around, surely
If we made assault legal, the crime rate would plummet
I don't exactly think I made it sound like a war zone
As for getting into the world well I've lived abroad, I've travelled across 5 inhabited continents only missing Australia/Australasia
And I don't think the majority of assaults are between under 16s, I certainly can't find that in the official statistics
I would think the majority would be in the 18-30 category
In the summer it starts getting light here at 5am so I end up waking up much earlier than I need to
It stays bright until after 10pm at times
In winter it's dark when I leave to go to work in the morning and dark when I leave work to come home in the evenings and it's utterly, utterly depressing
A happy medium would be nice
Yeah Ireland's rate of assault (with very similar laws in a very similar country that you would expect to have extremely similar policing and reporting rates) in 2011 was  93
9 per 100,000 whereas Scotland's was 1,655
Probably the Highlands - all our internal rivalries are largely urban (ignoring the rivals within the Highlands themselves), so they're kept away from that, and everyone knows it's a beautiful part of the world
I dislike Cornwall
Unfortunately, the first few people I met from Cornwall were a bunch of backwards, insular, ignorant, small minded thick of pigshit bigots+, and its coloured my opinion of the place ever since
+To quote one, "there's a lot of nigg
no wait, can't say that
there's a lot of *negroes* in London, isn't there
Tbh, I wouldn't know enough to distinguish folk from the Southern regions
Same as I doubt folk would distinguish Northumbrians from Cumbrians
Balls
I did mean that haha
Just going it to change it to Southern to cover my bases
So *technically* I speak English
But I tend to use Scots words for functions when I can cause

Absolutely they can

In the old days, we used to answer by saying our city, town, or closest village and the last few numbers of our number
For example, “Edinburgh one oh nine two”.
These days my tendency is just “Hello” or my name - but my surname is double-barrelled and the whole thing works out at six syllables, so it’s not as simple as just “John Smith” or whatever, so usually just “hello
"Hello"
"Hi"
"Wit thu fuck do you want
"Whatsup"
Are all ecxeptible ways to answer the phone in Scotland
Traditionally 843AD but probably hard to actually indentify
The kingdom of Scotland was founded after the Pictish kingdoms, Dal riada, Strathclyde and Northumbrian Lothian were all united into one
This happened in the High middle ages I believe
Depends what you count
The precursor kingdom to Scotland was Dal Riata and was founded in 501 or 435 or 450 AD, or somewhere around there
People didn't really write much down in those days
&#x200B;
In 732 the kingdoms of Dal Riata and Pictand got the same ruler for the first time
&#x200B;
Kennith MacAlpine became king of Dal Riata and Pictland in 843 permenantly uniting the two kingdoms into the Kingdom of Scots/Kingdom of Alba
&#x200B;
I'd say 1177 years old is a decent figure to go with
I'm not sure how this history really works
Traditional founding date is 843 just combining Pictland and Dal Riada
Strathclyde wasn't integrated until the 11th century and the current border with Northumbria wasn't set until 1016
I can understand why you would think early Alba isn't synonymous with modern Scotland but it would seem to me that by the reign of the mad king Dòmhnall mac Chòiseim who adopted the title Rì Nan Albannaich (King of Scots/King of the Scots) we have Scotland
That was my reasoning yes, that Alba was north of the Fourth and Clyde
I see your argument as well like, just down to our definitions of when Scotland became Scotland
Perhaps leaving it until northumbrian Lothian was integrated is pushing it a bit, but I mostly look at it that way because Im from the Lothians :)
1) you can usually have what you need delivered
2) most cars have seats that fold up, so they honestly have as much cargo space as you’re ever likely to need
3) if your car isn’t big enough, there are plenty of hire services and friends with bigger cars
4) pickups just aren’t fashionable in Europe
They’re seen as cars for obnoxious dickheads, so no one has one unless they work on a farm
Maybe a bit lost in translation, it's called plasterboard in British English if that helps
The hilux wasn’t/isn’t exactly *common*, but they don’t have a particularly bad reputation like the others, it’s just that only people who actually need them would get one
I’ve seen a couple of fords here and there, but again only from people who regularly need a car like that
Ah, fair enough
Most houses built in the UK in the last few decades have plasterboard walls, or more accurately brick/breezeblocks on the outside, then a wooden frame with plasterboard and insulation in the cavities
We have nanny in English but it’s quite old fashioned now and not something you’d often hear
I’d say babysitter is the more informal of child minder
Yes, you’re probably right there
It’s perhaps a bit more middle class too
Ngl, I’m tempted myself, your highness
High school in England - we had "technology" a few times a week
It would be a few weeks of food technology (cookery, nutrition), textiles (sewing), resistant materials (wood and metal work), and IT
We'd loop between those four all year
To be honest, if you are applying for citizenship of an EU country, I think proficiency two out of the following three should be required: English, or the language of the country, or the language of another EU country
So if you want Swedish citizenship, and don't speak Swedish, but do speak English and, say, Polish, or German, or French, that should be ok
If someone wants to live in Wales they can learn Welsh if they prefer it over English as far as I care but I don't think learning the language of where you are going to live is too much to ask especially if you want to be a citizen
What if they lived in the useful 1% of the country
It's pretty quiet where I am
My (great) auntie who's 94 said when she was younger every single person knew eachother and everyone was friendly, but now the most it is would be taking in a parcel for them if they weren't home at the time of delivery
I used to be friends with my neighbour when we were younger, but even though we still live right next to eachother I haven't spoken to him in like 6-7 years
About 50-60 minutes by car
I think it's 65 or 70ish km one way
Hour on the train
20min drive, sometimes this can be up to 50min with traffic
20 minutes by car, 50 minutes by bus, 10 minute walk, then the same in reverse
Outside rush hour the bus drops to about 35 minutes, and the drive to 15
It's just a contract job though, only just over a year of this to put up with

I'm sorry but voting for a racist makes you a racist
Wish I did
Everyone is racist against Roma
Even the otherwise liberal subreddit /r/europe shows its true colours when the subject of Roma comes up
Yeah but then all my (trying) healthy eating will be a waste
You know that's exactly what they said about the Jews in the 1930s. And the Roma for that matter
Oh cool so you're just an actual Nazi
Good to know
That the location of one of the more significant locations during the Jacobite Rebellions, a series of wars over the British crown that ultimately led to the destruction of the Highland clan system, is right below the viaduct made famous by the Harry Potter films, the one the steam train goes over
I just find it funny how just below the Glenfinnan Viaduct there is the monument commemorating the landing of Bonnie Prince Charlie
We lost our independence to an accounting error
The Defenestrations of Prague
Did it ever happen in any other city, or was it just a speciality of Prague
Nah Scotland was an independent country for more than a century after that
Yeah, makes sense that they'd be primarily centred there, seat of power as it is
Just was curious in case there were some other cases I had missed
The chippys that I have
Pretty much everything is deep fried
Deep fried pizza is a popular choice
Deep fried Mars bars are more for tourists, but it's still nice
Also I'm from the lothians where chippy sauce is poured over everything
Chippy sauce is hp brown sauce mixed with vinegar
You'll always be asked if you want salt and sauce
This sauce can divide the nation, with the west of Scotland really disliking it and not serving it
The sauce is only sold in the Lothians
Best chippys are often found in Fife
However, the best I've had was in Oban
It's super common in Germany
The SNP plan to introduce it here and all the dafties freaked out about it
Edit: Although in Glasgow you could return your glass Irn Bru bottles to the Ice Cream van when it came round your way
Are you sure you don't mean Australasia
I've heard it referred to that before, but Oceania is more common, and it's much harder to confuse with Australia the country
What
It's basic manners not to tromp through someone's house in your shoes
I'd be raging if someone came n did that at mine
As others have mentioned, we don’t really have a festive beer but we have loads of mulled wine and cider this time of year
More recently we have mulled gin, which is also lovely
But my favourite is a hot chocolate with Bailey’s.
I don't actually know if there's a proper one
I know there are certain alcohols popular over christmas like mulled wine and certain brandys and whiskeys
Personally my family have always had the tradition of drinking those big 1l bottles of Cobra (an Indian beer usually served in curry houses) but I'm pretty sure that's only us (though you should totally do that too it goes great with christmas dinner)
It's quite fashionable in rural parts of Scotland, but restricted in certain urban areas to prevent air pollution/smog
Edit: I may be wrong, wood burning stoves may be okay, but wood on an open fire is not
In rural places not in urban areas as much
It's not common here at all to have it as the only source of heat anymore although it was in the past (along with coal)
We still burn wood but it's an extra, we use heating oil for the central heating
Open fireplaces and woodstoves are common, even trendy in rural UK houses but they very rarely serve as the only form of heating these days
I buy my firewood, you used to be able to collect windfall firewood here from the state owned forests but they only rarely grant permission to do that these days which is a shame
I have bought it split and unsplit, the lazy in me buys it split these days though and usually by the ton - mostly hardwood, elm, beech and oak are plentiful here and are usually what the firewood guys supply
Wait where is it restricted
I'm probably wrong, I mixed up stoves and fireplaces
History was a little shit for me growing up
Our teacher in primary only thought us about Mary Queen of Scots, the Victorians, and worldwar II 5 years on loop
Granted her accent and attitude would make David Cameron look like a Glaswegian
I am overly proven to RSI due to muscle problems so got an alphasmart (bad laptop) from the state because it also affected handwriting and spelling
Except u wasn't allowed to use it for writing the 20 spelling words we got a day
I also got bullied constantly due to being unfit due to the same muscle problems
So I didn't get force to go outside to be bullied at lunch time tif I didn't do lines at home
So after a year of that she starts taking lunch off me until I do the lines, only getting fought the week I left the head teacher calls me out for being there constantly, and I told her what was going on like it was a slight drizzle outside
I think not letting your accent, and history being remembered and being remembered by the English is pretty much what they did to the rest of the world
Tokyo, Kyoto, Nagasaki, Hiroshima, Kagoshima, Nagoya, Sendai, Nara, Osaka, Sapporo, Himeji, Fukushima, Yokohama, Fukuoka, Gifu, Kobe
I think they're all cities at least
Hopefully I didn't slip in any historical names rather than current ones
Tokyo, Hiroshima, Kukura (dunno if thats speĺed right), Osaka, Nagasaki
Thats it
It's got to the point where so many presenters of nature documentaries adopt a hushed, slightly halting, breathy voice, without even realising they're doing an Attenborough impression
It’s quite difficult to say for the UK at the moment, but at a guess probably Jacob Reese-Mogg
Most politicians who campaigned heavily for brexit are strongly disliked by the left (for obvious reasons), but he goes a step further
A few years ago, there was a fire in a high rise apartment building in quite a poor area of London
Around 25 people where killed I think, and it has been a highly political topic ever since
This is due to the fact that the fire was so deadly because the owner of the building had not given it fire proof cladding or something like that to cut down on expenses, something which has been used as a kind of “capitalism kills/profits more important than human lives” situation
Jacob Reese-Mogg, in an interview a couple of years later, more or less said that if he had been in the fire, he would have survived “because he had common sense”, basically implying that all the people who died did so because they where too stupid to recognise smoke
He’s also the most stereotypical Tory on the planet, and his general demeanour is pretty much “posh prick who thinks he’s better than you because he has money”. Seriously, just google him
He’s an obnoxious, infuriating man
[Jesus wept, my head hurts]
I’m surprised no ones mentioned Reese-Mogg so far
My guess is he’s not that hated anymore cause the Tories won’t let him open his mouth since his Grenfell tower comments
But yeah Margaret thatcher is definitely the most hated generally, especially in northern England/Scotland
I remember seeing American prick on the internet a while ago
Why the fuck would they make him ambassador
That would be like us resurrecting Margaret thatcher and appointing her ambassador to Argentina
Is Jeremy Corbyn really all that hated in Wales
I thought the left was quite popular there
I mean, he’s not exactly popular in Scotland, but that’s more of a disappointment and ridicule thing than a hatred thing
Oh I forgot about her
Damn
I’ve been trying to figure out who’s the most hated, and every UK comment I’ve seen says a different person
See, all I’ve seen so far about him is praise, except from r/Scotland, which (rightfully) hates his guts
It seems to me that most people have been fooled by his briefings into thinking that he’s very vigilant and handling the situation well
> defenestrated
Accidentally, of course
> She’s really hated
Good
Fair enough
Aye we have cheese toastys, sometimes we deep fry them too
> I mean not a deep fried
Why not
We showed everyone why trying to leave a massive union of cooperating nations out of sheer xenophobia is a bad idea
Stationing British troops in liberated parts of Germany and Austria helped the post war recovery
Prince Andrew's close relationship with Epstein and photographic evidence of him with an underage sex trafficked girl
Also that interview really didn't help
The interview Prince Andrew did with the BBC that was released on Saturday
Tried to deny claims he was close friends with Jeffrey Epstein and that he had sex with an underage girl and ended up making himself look more and more guilty every time he opened his over-privileged mouth

Bread
Holy fuck that's a lot of bread
Basically, Balkan Hospitality (an entirely well deserved stereotype, by the way - some of the friendliest and most open-hearted folk I've ever met) consists of the world's most aggressive grannies trying to feed you inhuman amounts of bread
Apart from being force fed vast quantities of bread, you mean
Nothing in particular, just a sense from everyone that guests were to be looked after, and then also getting taken out on the town in Mostar by the barstaff after they'd closed up for the night

I hate bucky
Litterally been called a plastic for it
I'm gonna get lynched for this but
i canny hold my drink
I speak neither Scots nor Gaelic naturally, and when I speak the former it's a horrific broad mixture of various Scots dialects
The latter I'm just trying to pronounce correctly right now
Depending on your view point this can either be quite embarassing and shameful or perhaps a good thing, shedding your 'cringy' Scottish accent
The prominence of that cringe only worsens my embarrassment on it
Thankfully I channel the feelings into some writing, so it's totally useless
But it does suck
It would never challenge my sense of being Scottish I don't think, but the assumption that people make that I'm English or British can be rather annoying
I once drank bucky in a glass
Scottish: I hate haggis, don’t like alcohol and don’t take drugs, I know I’m a disgrace
I don't like Buckfast tonic wine
It's a wine made by monks and is literally full of caffeine, so the alcohol lowers your inhibitions, but the caffeine buzzes you up, so you do really dumb shit
Basically it has a reputation for being the source of various crimes in Scotland
And it tastes absolutely awful

I lived in England for a few years, and there, raising your voice was (not shouting, just speaking up in a noisy environment or a large room) was considered rude, and mumbling was perfectly acceptable
I grew up in Austria,  where mumbling and speaking too quietly to be heard were considered really bad manners

*Scotland: the Promised Land* is a good documentary about the changes in Scottish society in the 20th century

Boy
Worse than Darien
Nova Scotia was a British colony
sort of
Nova Scotia was colonised by joint Scots and English efforts on behalf of the United crown (although the two countries were each independent, but part of the same kingdom)
Scots soldiers being used to support what was in essence an English colony was one of the motivations behind Darien
Probably Edinburgh, it's getting a bit ridiculous
Sort of spiraled with a situation where jobs were to be found here so people moved here and house prices went up which drew money into Edinburgh and exacerbated the existing cycle
We've gone up about 10% in population over the last 10 years which doesn't seem like it should mean much and it's not in terms of urban growth in other areas but Edinburgh has an issue where it's hemmed in by the Pentlands on one side and the Sea to the other meaning there's very limited space to build on
It's kind of resulted in an increased buildup in East Lothian but it's also caused a lot of problems in the city itself
You could maybe throw Dundee in there too for similar reasons
Tbh you could argue every city has developed the most since they’ve all kinda gone off and become a specialist city for something
I'd say Dundee too
It seems to have massively improved its reputation recently
I suspect it's an issue probably better solved by better transportation to the available land 10-20 miles to the east of Edinburgh where a lot of the new developments are going up
&#x200B;
The sea that borders on Edinburgh isn't a true sea it's part of the firth of forth which is a bit of the sea surrounded on both sides by land and fed by rivers, it's not my area of expertise but I imagine doing that could cause issues with maybe the flow of the water or causing it to flood other areas and I'm not sure the land would be that great for building anyway
Has Edinburgh really
If anything it's going down as it resembles London more and more with regards to the property market and nobody being able to afford to live there
I know the feeling
Qualifying is *our* World Cup
No one asked about you
>Also, anybody who even looks at a potato salad and considers adding cream or mayo belongs shot, imho
I may be overly passionate about this
I'm curious what you mean
I'm fairly sure the most common interpretation of potato salad is potatoes in mayonnaise and then you customise it from there with gherkins, peppers, red onion, whatever
It is here anyway
Ah cool, so it's similar, but with a homemade dressing rather than mayo
I have a ton of tatties to use and I think I've got all the other ingredients to hand so I'll give it a bash
Thanks
Its very common to have a middle name
Some people don't and thats always odd to hear
The way to do it is slowly over time with different things
The UK is nearly entirely metric at this point with only the road system still using imperial officially
Even our beloved pints are actually defined metrically rather than being based on the imperial measurement (by law it's 568ml)
Also are things like rulers and measuring tapes not already both imperial and metric
All ours have both scales in the UK (same with analogue thermometers)
Some people in the UK smoke with the thumb/index combo
It isn't nearly as common as the other method but you wouldn't get many funny looks for doing it
I've tended to notice it with people who are sharing a cigarette (makes it easier to pass to each other, I suppose the same reason most stoners do it)
Where I grew up I always liked the [Cripps building] of St John's College
It is strongly contrasting with the other architecture of the college
In Edinburgh where I live now the [National Museum] is extremely cool, and of course there is the [Scottish Parliament] building
Nearby, and perhaps not what people immediately think of when they hear "modern architecture" is/was Charles Rennie Macintosh's [Glasgow School of Art] building
Agreed
Free Jetskis for all
I can only really see that decreasing turnout in a lot of nations
Unique parties for what is often a tertiary political election for most people, parties that most people won't be interested in finding out about and which could quite easily not align with local politics
People will prioritise national, regional and local elections, making EU politics use completely different parties carries the high risk of creating a barrier between the generally already uninterested masses and the voting process
As it stands, I think such a proposed change would risk watching already pretty low EU electoral turn out decrease further
We had an offhand comment about Russia invading Finland but The White Death often comes up in conversation between teenagers
We weren't but I studied it in my spare time because I love historym
Yeah
We had a Scottish, a British, and a World topic for Higher, with Russian Revolution being a common choice for the World topic, though there was a bunch of other options
They could also vary quite a lot in era (Scottish history could be anything from War of Independence in 1300s to WWI & Scotland (stuff like Red Clydeside and the Hebridean land occupations))
There is definitely room for things like the Winter War in the curriculum under the used model and it gives a nice spread of topics and historical situations if done right
That's not really founded in good science
The Radio 4 show/podcast More or Less dove into this subject a while back and the conclusion was that there was a hell of a lot more research needed but that the doom and gloom statistics came from a handful of studies that could not support the conclusions
The biggest doom and gloom stats came from biomass studies over single seasons decades apart and had no controls, ie, they never bothered to look for a stable population figure in the first place
If I recall correctly a meta study was done based on three such studies that were hyperlocal in the focus
None of them controlled for the first year potentially being a boon year for the insects and none accounted for there being potential factors for a hyperlocal extinction (eg, someone decided to get a pet bat and lived 10m from the study site)
None of the studies accounted for the types of creatures collected either, so we could have a declining big insect population but a strengthening small insect population
So yeah, we could be facing a bug decline but we actually have no idea

I don't know how impressive it is, but I really like [The Kelpies
The Glasgow School of art was beautiful but its sadly been ravaged by fires
Aside from that there are countless beautiful castles and such in Scotland
Amazing, never knew about that since now
They're beautiful, shame they're in Falkirk but
These people are not disliked by any means, but with Coronavirus and all the EU workers leaving, it must be an extremely hard time to be a nurse

>how the government is oppressing it’s people, and how America is the last bastion of freedom shinning light over the world
In fairness, certain aspects of their population respond this way to most international stories involving Europe
By no means the majority, but you always have that loud braying minority espousing such nonsense
Because it was two upper middle class doctors’ who’s daughter went missing
If the dad was a binman and mum a hairdresser the media wouldn’t have gave half as much of a shit and would have been blaming the parents far sooner
If you see it as being an arbitrary philosophy, as the CCP often appears to, then it is quite easy to warp it to your own political needs
Doesn't hurt to try and make elsewhere sound dangerous for Chinese, keeps the pop

Got drunk, puked, kept drinking, puked more, still pulled
When on holiday in Dublin I asked for the cheapest pint in every bar
Oh mate i was 15 at the time and had game, i couldn't pull a trolley out Falkirk canal these days
The UK allows it
To be completely honest, I find it absurd that a lot of countries don’t. If I moved to another country, I would of course want to eventually become a citizen of that country
But if you make me give up my old citizenship in what seems like some pretentious, archaic method of ensuring loyalty towards my new country, then you can go fuck yourself
It’s not just potentially impractical, overly dramatic, and makes your country seem like it has an overinflated opinion of itself
It also just feels quite unwelcoming, like the government is saying “the only way you’ll *ever* be considered one of us is if you forsake any and all right to any other identity you may have
I am so thankful I have my German passport so I can still go visa free to the EU
A lot of people here seem to be against it, but I honestly haven’t seen anyone state *why* they’re against it
The closest I’ve seen is a few people say “it just doesn’t seem like that big a deal”, which really isn’t a good enough reason
When I typed this out I didn’t realise so many countries tied voting rights to citizenship, so that is also an important point
The UN recognises 195 countries in the world
Of those, 27 are in the EU
Yeah, I thought that was just how it worked everywhere
I’ve never seen any government record or form mentioning my dual citizenship, nor have I ever received any different treatment by government agencies for it
The British government just treats my how they treat every other British citizen, and if I go to Canada then the Canadian government just treats me like a Canadian citizen, and they don’t care about my British citizenship at all
I don’t see how that in any way affects the average Canadian other than if they really want their citizenship to feel special tho
Oh sorry you’ve misunderstood me
When I said “here” I meant “in this thread”, not “in the UK”.
I agree, I don’t think I’ve ever encountered a British person who’s against dual citizenships
Firstly, if someone spends a lot of time in both countries, then I think it’s entirely reasonable that they should be allowed to vote in both countries
Secondly, you could very easily just tie voting rights to residency rather than citizenship
Have it so citizens who haven’t lived in the country for x number of years can’t vote
Thirdly, does it really matter if someone lives in your country and doesn’t feel connected to it to the extent that they would happily give up on their home country entirely
That is a pretty fucking big ask
Why can’t they just be loyal to both
What in the hell is stopping them being loyal to both
Why is the right to a national identity entirely exclusive to a single country
Commonwealth citizens living in the UK can also vote in national elections
Yeah, it seems as though people from countries that already allow dual citizenship are completely ok with it, while people from countries that don’t allow it are quite strongly opposed to it
Although a work of fiction, the novel *Trainspotting* portrays the period in Scotland when the epidemic started to spread rapidly amongst intravenous drug users
The author, Irvine Welsh, was a housing officer with City of Edinburgh Council at the time, and much of the novel is based on both his own background, and the things he came across in that line of work
I'm told - I've not read it myself, I'm afraid - that the German memoir *Wir Kinder vom Bahnhof Zoo* (sometimes known as Christiane F in English) describes a similar situation in 1980s Berlin, especially amongst the homeless population
It was very bad here, mainly spread through needles rather than unprotected sex as Heroin had just come onto the market here in Scotland
The police continued to try and seize needles and other drug paraphernalia in an attempt to stop consumption but when your addicted to drugs you will do anything meaning in Edinburgh there was at one time only a couple hundred needles in circulation in the city
Meaning that reusing of spent needles was commonplace and drug abuse and HIV spread massively across Edinburgh and the Lothians and led to Edinburgh (specifically Leith) being known as the AIDS capital of europe
The very famous film "Trainspotting" is about this period, its famous in the UK and Europe but I don't know about the US
Hungarian
I don't understand a word of it, but it sounds so beautiful and exotic
It depends who it's coming from
Personally i think the banter between European countries is tidy, we spent years fighting each other and we all have troubled pasts and we all admit it
There's an honesty to that and Scottish humour is about being as bluntly honest and funny about life as you can be
You europricks can say whatever the fuck you want about whoever you want just make it funny and we are good
American's humor tends to be invasive, in your face and mean spirited (us v them mentalities) and they can't take it when you bite back
TL:DR Anyone so long as its funny
Palestine what the fuck
To be fair there are a lot of licenses here for stuff that might seem strange to some
Do you take it personally though
We give you a lot of grief but  apart from the nutjob nationalists, it's pub banter
Poland has a lot to be proud of, Poles were instrumental to the Allied victory in WWII in many ways
Polish codebreakers actually cracked the early war German enigma machines and were able to share this with the British which greatly helped the now famous work at Bletchley Park
Poles were also a massive part of the Battle of Britain making up the largest group of non-British pilots who fought and one Polish squadron, the 303 had a lower than average death rate than other RAF squadrons and yet was also the highest scoring Allied squadron during the Battle of Britain
Poland can also be proud of leading the way during the, mostly, peaceful dissolution of the Eastern Bloc which is really something people need to learn more about

"St Patty's Day" is the best one, Cracks me up hearing that
I'd love to see someone call my uncle Paddy a Patty
Read that as garlic and lost my head laughing about you arguing with a vampire
The vampire didn't
It was either "bairn", "wean", "wee yin" or "little cunt" depending on the situation
> There's no British English, you have to learn American English
Annoying when you want to translate cinéma to cinema and not movie theatre etc, etc
I have a very specific moan about it
I've been using the Gaelic course and I keep getting marked down for saying "in *the* hospital" rather than just "in hospital". I realise that "in hospital" is a literal translation of whatever phrase is up but I'd never say that, I'd always say "the hospital".
Lying to a large audience; there's too many news articles or even politicians that just completely pull things out their arses to deceive everyone
Even politicians not keeping promises for no good reason
politicians can drink alcohol in the house of commons
This should be illegal and drug and alcohol tests should be brought in
Why can a politician make a decision that affects peoples life's when under the influence
In the UK being a republican (technically illegal but not enforced) or offending people online
&#x200B;
Also pay day lenders
Do you really want Westminster to have the power to effectively arrest Scottish politicians at will if they ever screw up
>video games that have gambling mechanics that involve real world money either directly or indirectly should either be illegal to be sold to minors or at least implement methods that lock that feature out of minor range (if possible)
Fuck, not even sure we have to make it illegal so much as class monetized (ie real life cash payments by users) lootboxes and EAs 'surprise mechanics'  as gambling and therefore requiring gambling licenses and associatef restrictions associated with gambling products
Do that, enforce it, they basically will be killed off
Why should being a republican be made illegal
It's a perfectly legitimate political view
> instead of cutting off a, let's be honest, pretty useless part
Should an appendectomy be given to everyone at birth as well then
an accident isn't a lie, lying is essentially intent to deceive
And I don't mean to send them right to jail, maybe even a hefty fine just so they'll be less inclined to create bullshit
Truth isn't subjective but governments also lie and when you give the state power to enforce truth you'll inevitably end up with a state that uses it for its own power
how can truth be subjective though
I'm talking about if they intend to deceive people with what they say, not if they make a slip up or something
A good example would be boris johnson and brexit as a whole
I read the question very wrong
In the UK being a republican is illegal and that fact annoys me
Are you saying that female genital mutilation should also be legal or just male genital mutilation
they're just making a comparison to female circumcision which i've heard is the equivalent to cutting off the top of the penis completely
But what happens if the court says it was intentional
And even ignoring that can you think of a single politician who has not lied at least once
Why would you think it would be evenly enforced
Ah okay, fair do's. Is it actually illegal
First time I've heard that
>That is already illegal, and much more intrusive and dangerous than male circumcision
This is a common misconception
You're assuming all FGM is the worst kind
When it can actually range from the "relatively" simple removing of the clitoral hood to much, much worse
>One other major difference is that female genital mutilation is not a core concept of (at least) two major world religions, so the decision to make it illegal is much more obvious
Utterly fucking irrelevant
I'm sorry for swearing, but that it literally utterly **fucking** irrelevant
We're talking about people mutilating babies and your worried about hurting Bronze Age cultists feelings
>Male circumcision is a comparatively minor surgery
As someone else pointed out tattooing babies is significantly more "minor" because it's no longer a permanent act
I never understood the need to differentiate genital mutilation
It should be illegal to preform on children of any gender
Of course it's less common
It's fucking illegal
it might be because i'm tired, but I really don't know what you're on about
I'm talking about lying with intention to deceive a large audience out of malice
Yeah, but there is also a certain benefit to having a relatively famous living monarchy
Flogging stuff during the royal weddings, jubilees, hell, even advertising on press stories about the family, these things get gobbled up by certain audiences abroad to a decently pretty penny, in addition to the actual sites
Plus the whole theatre of the guards seems to generate different interests from say the traditional but uninhabited castles in Scotland like Stirling, Edinburgh and Urquhart
It's a weird one, the pageantry probably does generate some additional interest and ability to make money even from international audiences who aren't visiting
I personally don't much care for them, but there does seem to be a fair number of little industries built around a living monarchy, from publications to 'commerative' tat
Last time it was actually enforced was something like the 1970s and it might not stand up to things like the human rights act or ECHR these days but yeah technically it's still illegal
>Treason Felony Act 1848 Section 3
>*If any person whatsoever shall, within the United Kingdom or without, compass, imagine, invent, devise, or intend to deprive or depose our Most Gracious Lady the Queen, from the style, honour, or royal name of the imperial crown of the United Kingdom, or of any other of her Majesty’s dominions and countries, or to levy war against her Majesty, within any part of the United Kingdom, in order by force or constraint to compel her to change her measures or counsels, or in order to put any force or constraint upon or in order to intimidate or overawe both Houses or either House of Parliament, or to move or stir any foreigner or stranger with force to invade the United Kingdom or any other of her Majesty's dominions or countries under the obeisance of her Majesty, and such compassings, imaginations, inventions, devices, or intentions, or any of them, shall express, utter, or declare, by publishing any printing or writing ... or by any* *overt act* *or deed, every person so offending shall be guilty of felony, and being convicted thereof shall be liable ... to be transported beyond the seas for the term of his or her natural life
Since transportation to Australia was stopped in 1868 the penalty now would be life imprisonment
&#x200B;
The last time it was used was 1972 to charge some members of the IRA but those charges were dropped in favour of the more realistic charges relating to terrorist activities
&#x200B;
In 2013 the government confirmed it was still on the books but also effectively said it would never be used
I see what you're saying but there are numerous reports in my country (and I'd assume all over Europe) of little girls being taken back to Africa or the Middle East to have FGM preformed
And I don't think the numbers vary as much as you may assume
According to Google approx 1 in 4 men are circumcised
If there's 7 billion of us that's about 875 million males
Whereas according to Wikipedia UNICEF estimated  a few years ago that the number of women who have gone through FGM is about 200 million
It not a huge gap
I'm sorry
In Greenock there’s the cat man of greenock, who supposedly was a Russian sailor who broke his legs when his ship came ashore and couldn’t get back so he has survived for the last 40 years on rats
Could also be the mascot of greenock Morton who is also a cat
I presume Näcken (or a Polish derivative) inspired the Nekkers in the Witcher
They seem very similar
Christ, poor guy
Breaking your legs is one thing, but doing it in *Greenock*... no one deserves that
Wouldn’t know cos the only place in Greenock I’ve really cut about is the Little Sisters of the Poor n I don’t think he’d cut about there imo
That's normal for the UK as well
*Friendship ended with Canada
Terrible
Usually the host will buy in some crates of beer and a couple bottles but nothing more than that
I don't know German but if there's a debate about it I can't see why it shouldn't just be put down as neutral
It's interesting, it's not something we have a specific word for and it's always something I've taken for granted
Just the other day I drove to a fairly remote one with some friends to climb a hill
Slept in the car, and there was a pretty nice toilet block as well
Hate; that we hate English people
The vast and overwhelming majority of Scots don't hate English people
Ammused by; alcoholism
like for most European countries its like the spiderman pointing at spiderman meme
U do tho
scotland probably has more junkies than alcoholics if I'm being honest
I'm English (but essentially an adopted Scot by this point) and I do enjoy people who haven't spent any meaningful time up here telling me how much the people I love, the people I live and work with and the people I've been surrounded by every day for nearly a decade hate me
I mean aye there's idiots who would probably make it an English thing but most I've suffered is a bit of banter
And now I get "well, you're basically Scottish now anyway
" half the time
Agree on the alcohol one
Though I've noticed it swings between some nationalities calling us a bunch of alcoholics and other proudly proclaiming something close to alcoholism (I can drink X amount in Y time) because of ancestry
As for how I'd answer OP's question from an English perspective: I'm from Yorkshire so find it amusing that people like to characterise all of us as tea drinking, crumpet eating poshos with clipped accents
Though I do love tea it has to be said
I just don't have time or even a big enough house to sit around in the afternoons like I leapt from the pages of a Jane Austen novel
Hate that it's assumed that many of us are anything but largely indifferent to the royals
There's a few absolute weirdos who will camp out for a week in London when there's a wedding or a baby due but most English people don't care that much
Indeed
Very interesting read I must say
And yeah you're right theres a few fannies here and there that gee it "ah fuckin hate the English" but its mostly just patter
Not a fan of drunken Irishman patter
Apparently that stereotype came from people stealing sheep years and years ago when there were laws where you'd get a finger or whatever cut off for having sexual relations with a sheep but something worse (can't remember) for stealing it, so every welsh sheep thief just said they had sex with it to get the lesser punishment
I don't know how accurate this is, I found it on reddit a fair while ago
Nah but yous do tho
I suppose so, just a laugh but innit
They're at it too like
Aye mate x
Depends on the weather and what I'm doing
I went biking in the Highlands last year where it was a sunny 13 degrees and I felt comfortable in a short-sleeved shirt
I brought a light jacket with me in case the weather took a turn but it would've been too hot to wear it most of the time
I'd say if I'm not moving a lot, the sun is out, & there's not much wind - probably 14 or 15
> Though I might as well wear a jacket if it's under 25°C.
Anything between 15 and 25 degrees is tops off, shorts on sunbathing weather for us northerners
To be fair in the winter you can sometimes see folk here cutting about in shorts when it's 2 degrees out haha
I've seen barbecues being set up at 13°C a few weeks ago lol
I'm quite fond of the shorts and hoodie combination myself
It's interesting how you can pick out different nationalities in St Andrews
The Americans with their shorts and flip flops, the English with their red trousers and the Scottish with their Fife Council work gear
(Obviously I'm taking the piss a bit, my partner went to St Andrews and there were a few other Scottish accents there but not all that many)
He’s one in a million
Scottish independence failure and brexit
Former no voters are switching for independence as the government does not seem to care about Scotland, they are doing a great job at convincing us to stay
Kyiv (which I've visited three times since 2014) is a pretty cool city
It feels really like you are deep in the middle of a transition from a 'post-Soviet country' to a 'normal European country, but with a cool edgy vibe'.

The Norwegian Antarctic expedition is made so much more impressive than it would otherwise be given that Norway had only become independent 6 years earlier
His family don't give anything away
Nobody knows his actual condition
The most recent update was a good few years ago where we were told he could not walk
My grandad was an RAF recovery mechanic during the Berlin Airlift
He was always proud of his service, and despite growing up in an era when Germany were "the enemy", retained a fondness for the ordinary people of Germany from his time stationed there
I'm 35, my four grandparents were born in these years; 1902, 1903, 1907 and 1909
Unfortunately this also means that I met only one of them, the one born in 1909
She lived to a ripe old age and died in 2005
My parents were born in 1945 and 1946
The majority of my peers had parents born in the mid - late 50s/early 60s. So I had an older family
Yep, the way I was brought up was patently different to how my peers were brought up
They had more freedom and a more "relaxed" up bringing
There are of course other factors to that but this is a generalisation
Almost all of my peers' mothers had either a full or part time job
My mother was a housewife all of her post marriage days
The shift in culture is remarkable
My parents themselves were the products of older parents so some very traditional values were still evident in my household
We haven't, have claimed to be the new Greece once though
None unless you count those times I was drunk and found a toga
Ha Rome ain't shit
Scotland was a pretty major centre for the European enlightenment so there's bee a lot of claims that we're the inheritors of the ancient Greek philosophical tradition
In the 19th century we even tried to make a replica of the Parthenon before running out of money
Same in Glasgow
Doesn't stop us though
No; "big screen" would generally be the word used in UK English, but even then it doesn't quite work as a noun, and the "big-screen" still refers to the method of showing it and not the event
"They've set up a big-screen".
And interestingly 'trek' was borrowed from Dutch
Due to how many people in very poor contries both speak English and have access to the internet we get a lot of phone tech scams some of which are extremely sophisticated
I visited Belarus about 4 years ago when I was in my travelling phase
I actually really liked it, honestly one of the best countries I've visited on mainland Europe
All the people seemed pretty nice, authorities were generally easy enough to deal with, no one (that I know of) tried to scam me or anything like that, didn't get anything nicked, never felt unsafe or anything like that, didn't feel remotely as dodgy as some other bits of eastern Europe
I had the pleasure of visiting it 2 years ago but I only felt safe due to the group I went with had friends down in Cape Town where we were
The one time I went to the toilet in a “shopping mall” I was followed to the toilet but I am a rather tall and could say intimidating due to my size and nothing happened but if I was smaller then I might have gotten things stollen from me
I would go back but I would probably stick to the more affluent areas which is a real shame
I still dream about the Langos I had in Hungary 5 years ago
And flammkuchen, definitely a flammkucken fan
Was not expecting the pun lol
You should try it in Scotland
Also broodje americain
Basically a raw meat paste on a bread roll
When I moved there I thought I’d never try it
Eventually I did and I’ve loved it ever since
Also love fritjes met stoverij and mayonnaise
I dont think there is anything a Belgian won’t put mayo on
That’s a bit of a reach from what little info is on that wiki
All it says is that there was a reference to it from Los Angeles that’s old but the wiki lists older references and goes into similar dishes that likely inspired it
Marks and Spencer’s sometimes have it in
I was just kidding - it's a Scottish dish
I love it too, they sometimes serve a gourmet version of it at Scottish weddings - it's the only reason I go if I'm invited, tbh
Yeah true, much more black and white pudding here but if you see it, it’s definitely worth trying
A nice whiskey cream sauce with it and you’re sorted
Oatmeal is there to bulk it out because oats are the only thing that traditionally grew here, and in the past killing animals was rare and expensive so you had to make it last
Most people are saying some that are *disliked* by the general public, but imo the Saltire  is generally under appreciated as we are usually just lumped in with the Union Jack
The original saltire flag where the cross is gold rather than white, and the lion rampant royal banner are underappreciated
The current government have also ruined the saltire, but that's another story
Fella who lives a few doors down from me has a confederate flag in his car on display on the top of the boot
Not a clue why, I'm sure they're Romanian and while I don't understand why anybody would want to show that flag off, I especially don't understand why non-Americans would
Don't think it's under appreciated
You see it everywhere and on loads of products
Always see it on salmon and strawberries
In what way have they ruined the saltire
Theyve appropriated it and made it a symbol of arrogance and bigotry
It no longer represents Scotland in the eyes of it's people, just represents the SNP
Hahahaha
I’ve only ever heard that from the most fanatical of fanatic Unionists, it’s quite cringeworthy
You might want to get rid of the saltire next to your user name and replace it with a Union Jack then mate
We know the people who love waving that around are all very tolerant none of them bigoted in the slightest
I'm not a "fanatical unionist", and you're only proving my point
You're trying to say that people who arent members of the SNP arent really Scottish
As if the 2 are connected
National flags should be kept out of politics
I didn’t say you weren’t really Scottish at any point
I’m just surprised you have the saltire on your username given your views
You are the one who has allowed politics to taint your view of something as simple as a national flag
People who support Scottish Independence, funnily enough, like to use the national flag of Scotland
I just find it astounding that any normal person would allow this to taint their view
Kerby/Kirby
Kick a football against the kerb on the road so that it bounces back to the kicker (as opposed to missing the kerb and going into someones garden or down the road)

That was called the "Jessie Test" in Scotland in the late '90s, although generally it was done with a coin or a bit of hard plastic

Kids
I play this with my partner
We call that "Battery Codes" where I'm from
There's also "Codes", but that's for losers as they just had to give up their letter when you caught them rather than beating it out them
Sounds sort of like two(ish) games we had, Codes and Battery Codes
In codes if you caught someone they had to give you their letter, in Battery Codes you had to beat it out of them
We always chucked balls when playing kerbie, I've never seen it done with kicking
Our kerbie rules allowed you to go into the middle of the road and make a second attempt if you got a kerb and it landed back in your half of the road
My pal got the greatest shot I've ever seen, it was a backwards, over the head shot
He hit the opposing kerb, hit his kerb on the bounce then landed right in the middle of the road

There can be no peace between the Scots and the English
We will not rest until every Englishman lies dead upon the battlefield
...but since everyone seems to have adopted this stupid “genocide is bad actually” rule for some reason (grumble*), I *suppose* we can settle for them moving the nukes (more grumble*)
Scotland only has one big city, and whilst it's not as well known as the capital, most people are aware that Glasgow is a city in Scotland - if only because it hosts a relatively famous football rivalry
Aberdeen, Inverness, and Perth are always forgotten
People only know of Glasgow and Edinburgh
I've actually stayed a few days in Linz
My mate was on Erasmus there and went over to visit him for a week
I had a great time there
Was a nice place
I know Nicosia because of Omonia and APOEL
Aside from Juventus, Turin's pretty well known in the UK because it's where the classic movie *The Italian Job* is set
In Scotland, we Celtic fans have become well acquainted with Trondheim in the last few years
> Australian answer: Literally every city other than Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra
We've all heard of Perth too
I assume you're not a fan of APEOL haha

I was guessing Everett, which is where Boeing has their super factory

‘How do you like my new haircut

Also extremely punctual, except when it comes to trains
For a nation that values punctuality so much I was quite surprised when I lived in Germany that train delays (like everywhere else) are very commonplace
One of my bests mates is like this
We agree to meet in the pub at 8 and he strolls in at 9:30 and I'm half drunk because I'm not going to stand in a pub myself without a beverage
I've got to the point that whatever time we agree on, I know I've got at least an hour before I actually need to be there
It's not a direct answer the question, but it is relevant:

I try to take the train where it is possible to get from departure to destination in one day; if a train journey would involve an overnight stay, I fly
I'd also fly if I have to get to an early meeting or something and it just wouldn't work to get the train
But as a general rule, the train is my first choice for any journey of less than about 7 hours
(All this is in the old days, of course, before Covid destroyed travel
If I was travelling inside Scotland, train but If I am going England or further i fly
You guys are portrayed in movies
Scotland isn't a tribal warrior society or a drug addled shit hole  (at least in most places)
The hell are you on about we're one of the most popular places to set a movie especially relative to our size
I don't know when I learned to ride, but it was really early
Various years our big present for the year (combined Christmas and Birthday) would be bicycles, when they needed replacing due to growth
It's fairly common for most to know how to, and there are sometimes cycling safety classes later in primary school, but a lot of people don't generally cycle, which is why it was quite notable that I cycled between the villages and over the various hills and Braes to school sometimes, and later for work
I believe I was maybe 7-8
I couldn't ride a bike that we had because we were staying on some large(ish) campsite so to get to the main amenities was either a fairly long walk or a cycle
So I kinda forced myself to learn then
Didnae learn until I was 13
Some Irish legends might be a nice change, they never get enough love
I'm not sure how you could muckl it up

Because there wasn't any lyffewaffle left to spot
Not whatever the order 1886 was
The 30 years war or the wars of the 3 kingdoms would make excellent games
I've always thought that a fun quirky twist on WW2 would have you playing as communist partisans in Yugoslavia
You would find yourself fighting against Nazi occupation and the Ustaste and would fight alongside the Chetniks until a character (maybe a brother or family member who works for the chetniks) reveals they are secretly working for the Nazis
This as such leads to you being captured by the Gestapo and betrayed and you have to escape and hunt them down
I have always thought that a game where you play as a guerilla which has unique stealth components but gradually more open action sequences as the game finishes towards the end of the war in the yugoslavian countryside of hills and mountains would be awesome
Maybe it sounds better in my head
Another good idea would be a game about the spanish civil war, the conflict was very brutal if you ever need an account the spanish holocaust is a good book
But a game set starting either in 1934 or 1936 of a family based somewhere like Salamanca or Badajoz
They are poor peasants who struggle to get by due to the brutal autocratic landlord
We could have one of the protagonists in love with the landlords daughter but eventually Francos collumn would come and would devestate the town and the family would witness the brutal massacre of Badajoz probably with some of the family being killed
Eventually our protagonist flees and eventually ends up in Madrid where he takes part in the seige of madrid where he witnesses the frictions between communists  and Democrats
After several missions of fighting and bombings eventually Madrid falls to nationalist forces and our protagonist is executed
Yeah you guys don't get enough love in some ways I think, could be biased being a Scot and all
"Those Scotch bastards"
Responded to with "they English cunts"
Irish, great bunch of lads, Welsh are sound cunts, the english are just cunts
I have to say I've never heard many Irish nicknames apart from the usual anti Catholic stuff
Septic tanks
We learn about the causes of the war, the rise of the NSDAP, Hitler's policy to expand Germany's borders to create more Lebensraum for the German people
As for the course of the war, it took on a very British slant
Most lessons focussed on the Battle of Britain, the bombing of British cities by the Luftwaffe, rationing of food and evacuation of children from British cities, and D-Day
We also spent some time learning about Germany's invasion of the USSR and some important battles there
We spent almost no time though learning about the war in Africa, the far east or in Italy
Yeah, I found this rather odd because we, at least in Scotland, learned the same stuff over and over each time the topic came up in class
I actually only know as much as I do about both world wars and the subsequent conflicts (eg
Cold war, korea, Vietnam, etc
) because I took a personal interest beyond what was taught
We get that in Scotland too :)
Scotland: the future
> Literally all of it, except maybe the troubles
There's enough shitey ballads by crap "folk singers" to suggest that some romanticise the Troubles too
Yes
Crispy duck pancakes are a staple of Chinese takeaway food, duck is otherwise pretty niche
My Uni formal dinners used to always have guinea fowl, to the point that it became a bit of a joke

Probably Cumbernauld in Scotland
There’s a few contenders though tbh
[‘Som we are moving to Cumbernauld
Milton Keynes is
interesting, but not pretty
Abderdeen often gets a lot of shit, compared to other major cities in Scotland
I think it's fine, albeit certainly not the best we have to offer
Cumbernauld is pretty ghastly
Unpopular opinion, but as someone from Edinburgh, I *hate Glasgow
* It's got noting to do with the rivalry or the accents or any of that stuff, but the city centre grid never fails to confuse me and get me lost within minutes
In Edinburgh, every street is pretty much unique, in a unique direction and connecting to unique places
It's probably stupidly complicated, but for somebody who grew up here, I could be plopped on any random street in the city and pretty much know where I am and make it home without a map
Plop me in a grid and I'm fucked
It looks like Garry's Mod or Half Life maps were transplanted into reality
Oddly enough, I kind of like it
I associate that run down, source engine appearance with the early 2000s, which makes it feel quite nostalgic
The first picture actually looks like it's in some random Brazilian city, which I guess makes sense
What's it called
Remember when they made an advert to encourage people and businesses to move there
Tolkien based Mordor off of the Industrialisation of Britain I believe, so yes, it literally is it
I applied for a job in Tilburg the other day, I'm glad to not see it on here either  But tbh I'm from the worst city in Scotland so it would be fitting to move to the worst city in ND
Sorry, don’t know who that is
Yes
I live and work in England and it doesn't matter how much I tone it down, someone will still pretend they don't understand me
I have a very strong  Scottish accent (broad Scots as we say in Scotland
) and when me and my wife were on holiday in Italy we were sat a table for dinner in our hotel with about 5 other couples
It was an outside barbecue type thing where you went up to the grill and got your food there
After sitting talking to the other couples for a bit I went up to get me and wife some desserts and when I came back I could tell by my wife’s face that she was not happy
Apparently while I was away one of the women at the table complained to my wife that she couldn’t understand a word I was saying
And then others started agreeing with her
She told us to just leave the desserts and we left and she told me what happened afterwards
I wasn’t bothered at all but you do not mess with someone my wife cares for
In Scotland not really, I kind of mostly unintentionally purged my native Dundonian accent through years abroad and at university and now have a difficult to place lowland accent that isn't clearly of anything and isn't easy to place on the working-middle class spectrum
Abroad I do though, but mostly in good humour
Yes
I live in a different part of the country to where I grew up, so I get mocked for it
I don't get bad impressions, but I do get called "chookta"+ a lot
+The Glaswegian pronunciation of *teuchter*, meaning "country-dweller". I'm not from the countryside, but some Glaswegians seem to be under the impression that Scotland = Glasgow + a couple of crofts
People have done yeah but not often
Usually its other Scottish people who do because I have a very strong accent
Sean Connery's barely even got a Scottish accent
I wish us teuchters had a word for them, toonser just does nae really do it
You're pretty correct
I've found a lot of similarities in pronunciation between German and the Scottish dialect
It's like a cheat code that makes learning German easier for us
When I'm back up the road I get called a toonser, because I'm from the city and not the shire
"Weegie" or "weegie mink" works for the locals where I am the now
We also have words like "Ken", which means "Know". I'm sure it's sort of similar to the word in German
They are usually paid
I can't fully answer your second question - I'm not sure if it's legal or not, but companies might offer "work experience" which is often the same work as an internship but it is unpaid
Internships in general aren't very common - most common areas are banking, finance and consulting
I quite like it
New buildings aren't as exciting, but I love the Empire State, Rockefeller centre, the PANAM building (fuck off Metlife), and the Chrysler [(IMO the Chrysler building is the pinnacle of Skyscraper design, nothing on earth beats its iconic appearance]
However, the metro looks like it hasn't been upgraded since the 1980s. From a purely practical standpoint, it's fine in getting you around the city, but it really is smelly and dirty looking
The city itself is also quite dirty, albeit I've seen similar levels of grime back home so it didn't phase me too much
Yeah the metro is really weird
It runs 24/7 and gets you to places, but it's fucking ugly to look at
London manages to have a good metro, I expected NYC's to be equal to it
All that broken windows shit has been mostly discredited now
Rudy Giuliani was good at self promotion but he was a fucking knob
I think the grid system actually works well, for Manhattan
Maybe it's cause I'm just a visitor/tourist, but I appreciate how easy it makes navigation
Downtown Manhattan, which is still largely adhering to the colonial street layout, didn't feel any better or more interesting than the northern half of the island
I guess wind tunnels can be a real issue though
As a Weegie I definitely appreciated New York's grid layout as it is very much like Glasgow city centres grid layout
The major difference is Glasgow doesn't have numbered streets, where as a lot of (most of
) New York City's streets are numbered
I like it for for the same reasons that I like STALKER and Metro 2033 games
Yeah, I don't know anything about running a metro, but I imagine running 24/7 is a real challenge for them
Cleaning, repairing, and upgrading while still having to serve riders must be a massive headache
> Why would you expect NY’s metro to be as good as London
Because New York City is a pedestrian city
Most New Yorkers don't own cars and they learn to drive at an older age than most Americans
It's also a rich city, so funds shouldn't be an issue
It has the grime and wear of a "lived in" city, it doesn't look sterile or artificial
But still, if I were a local I'd probably be quite sick of dealing with that
We don't all have to be as clean as Tokyo, but that station looks like it's been abandoned for decades
>  a lot of them complain about the attention NYC gets and don’t want their taxes used to fund city public transit that they won’t personally use
Of course, despite the fact that NYC, as a rich city, keeps their bumblefuck towns solvent
Tbf I think I can sympathise with the upstaters on this one
In the UK, the centralisation and focus on London is considered quite detrimental to the rest of us
It'd be nicer to be more decentralised like Germany is, instead of having one big city hogging up everything and leaving the rest of the country with leftovers
My favourite is the film ‘Jaws’ which in French is known as ‘Les Dents de la Mer’

It’s actually not at all a poorly written or recorded song, and it’s quite catchy

This is quite interesting, it makes me think about Britannia and Columbia, which represent Britain and the USA respectively, are both female personification with Latinish names
Is this a theme for other nations
Britannia is the female personification of Britain and I've seen the UK refered to as the "mother country" specifically in regard to British born Canadians volunteering for the First World War but I don't know if that was a truly common held thought at the time
Growing up and going to school in Canada I couldn't say that there is much of a personification of Canada or even any of the provinces but maybe
I know that there are 2 personifications of the USA one being female and one male
Columbia being the female personification and Uncle Sam being the male one which is usually used in a less "pure" or "idealistic" context than Columbia usually is
Edit:Columbia not Colombia
Never seen one before
In the 5 places I've lived long enough to remember the windows, 3 of these had these, one was a high rise student flat so didn't have them for safety, and only one just didn't have these
I think they're still fairly common
You're right
I don't really get the people saying they're not common
Every flat I've ever lived in, including my parents, had them

Well your president used to have two amazing Bernese mountain dogs so it makes sense
RIP Síoda x
I thought you were way off but after researching it there are actually more cats than dogs adopted in the UK
But more people have dogs than cats, which means cat owners are likelier to have more than one (aka crazy cat ladies)
I think most people here will know about Gaelic and Scots so let's throw in a strange one
Beurla reagaird is the traditional language of the highland travelers/highland Scottish gypsies today only spoken by a few dozen elders
Scottish Gaelic and Old Scots
Old Scots is believed to be time capsule of medieval English
Don't know
All I'm pulling up from a search is the Old English dialect and the modern dialect
England has quite a lot of dialects, to be fair
Might be wrong, but never heard of Northumbrian as a language
Yeah, it's got about 1
7 million speakers, the largest minority language in Europe
Theres a difference, although technically called just 'Scots' people in the UK often mistake it for the local dialect of Glasgow, when in reality one is a language and one is a slang
People here tend to call it Old Scots to make the distinction
make sure you have all the correct documents and we might keep you
I own a high end electric bike
Here living without some form of transport would be a bit iffy but an electric bike does fine
You could use a regular bike but the hills here are killer
Yes, living in the countryside with absolutely garbage public transport
I don't own a car but if I wanted to work in the nearest town I would really need one as the last bust back to where I live is at 6pm and that's during the week
Not at all
I live roughly a mile and a half from the city centre, plenty of cycle paths to get me there, and if the weather was too bad for cycling, great bus and subway links to the city centre
There's absolutely no reason for me to get a car currently, it would just be a waste of money
Is that fish Jenga
I'm not 100% of the cut-off for where is or isn't in the Balkans so no doubt I'll make a mess of this
Personally I'd say Sarajevo
You've got the assassination of Franz Ferdinand and the Siege of Sarajevo
I've also got family there so I might be biased
I would say Belgrade, but if Istanbul or Athens counts as Balkan, that changes things
Given the way some folk still go on about it, *Kosovo Polje*.
I know of Belgrade through the whole Kosovo situation but I admit I don't know a whole lot
To me Balkan = former Yugoslavia, even if this is putting the cart before the horse
“Why use that definition when you know it isn’t right
Well there is a presumption here that I know what the correct definition is, but that isn’t actually the case
I knew that Albania for example was part of the Balkans (even though it was not part of Yugoslavia) but not Romania for example
In fact, the question of which countries count as “Balkan” appears to be a matter of dispute in this discussion board, and even in histories of the region if my memory of Misha Glenny’s book on the topic serves me correctly
When it isn’t clear what the correct usage is, people usually reach for the most straightforward explanation: hence the reference to Yugoslavia
I acknowledge this is ahistorical but nonetheless I am sure it is what would be understood by most people around me
The other Balkan nations would probably be seen as distinct entities (with Albania as a possible exception)
Greece is Greece, Turkey is Turkey etc
You are quite right to point this out as being equivalent to equating all of the United Kingdom to England
but it’s also a very common mistake
Hopefully that explains it a bit, and I apologise if I was being too flippant in my first post
The Balkans is a peninsula, named for the mountain range
I don't think anyone can just go about digging in their back garden and find anything worth while but it's pretty common to just see walls and know they're old as shit
>500 - 1000: At this point you're mainly looking at ruins and castles
They're scattered across the country and often take time to reach, but you won't just walk upon one on your daily commute
This is the period of our history which is the least densely packed
The Britons, Anglo Saxons and Vikings were not the greatest builders
Also includes ruined walls and artificially widened streams for ships, from the vikings (they exist in the isles)
> Any time before 0AD: Extremely rare
You're looking at things like Stonehenge and the Knap of Howarr
Both of those things were more ancient at 0 AD than things from 0 AD are now
There is quite a lot of 500bc-0ad stuff scattered around Scotland
It hasn't been built over because we have nothing built for most of the country
On that note, Christopher Lee (aka Dracula, Count Dooku, and Saruman) made a metal music video about Charlemagne defeating the Saxons, believe it or not
[I SHED THE BLOOD OF THE SAXON MEN]
Yeah I suppose it can be controversial, but Christopher Lee is apparently able to trace his ancestry back to Charlemagne, so he decided to just go ahead and make a whole metal album about his distant grandad when he was in his mid 80s.
You're never too old to try out new stuff lol
I know lots about the EU, it's full of communist nazis, the paper that used to have boobs in it told me

Oh I see, so it’s not really curiosity about Poland but an attempt to show off
Fair enough
My (Scottish and English) family live in the North of England but are about to move back to Scotland
They had a delivery guy come to the house who caught wind of the fact they were moving and asked them if it was because of independence, that he “liked Scotland” and why they want to leave the UK
They are moving to help care for my grandmother
I used to visit with my partner back when we lived in CZ, and we even preferred it to Prague
I don’t think my family even gave him an answer
Telling them it was because of my grandmother would have probably made him feel awful so I don’t think they did
I think that in general it’s bad form to discuss politics in these situations
I have my own views, which some people would probably describe as radical, but I’m not going to bring them up at work or when I am talking to strangers because it’s unnecessarily divisive
The merits of EU membership, Scottish independence, abortion rights etc
are not relevant to day to day interactions and serve only to hurt interpersonal relationships unnecessarily
Scotland, despite being small, is in some ways one of the parents of the modern world, having invented or discovered so many things that make our current society possible: [Scottish Inventions and Discoveries (it's long)]
Think the condensing steam engine, various electronics discoveries, tropical medicine, penicillin, insulin, television, bicycles (including pneumatic tyres), telephone, the principles of radio, ATM and PIN
So many more

In the UK football fans are kept segregated, rugby fans are all in together so that probably sums up how unlikely violence amongst the fans is
Rugby is the number 2 team sport here, but it's a distant second to football
When there's a big rugby international in Edinburgh, there's lots of issues, but it's mainly due to excessive alcohol consumption, rather than organised fighting
There's a bit of classism at work, and the media will describe rugby fans as "rowdy" where football fans would be called "thugs" for similar incidents
I'm now trying to imagine toffs having a scrap
Aye, it's class eh
I'm not a football fan but the atmosphere certainly seems better in Germany than back home
Get into an argument with our spouse and tell everyone we're getting a divorce and then not follow through

We never learned about actual Scottish history except in primary school (from which I only remember the jacobites, not even who they were or what they did)
In high school the "Scottish" unit was about WW2 and the only Scottish part was the names of some of the Scottish regiments and stuff
So basically I know nothing about my own country
Just bits and bobs like our failed attempt at a colonial empire
Pretty funny but never looked at it in school really
Edit: also the real story about how the act of union happened
The Darian scheme and Roman era history would have been cool
The Wars of the Three Kingdoms were never really covered in enough detail, and seemed to focus on the English parliament vs monarch view, where the events throughout these islands have a huge influence on the way the UK is today
I almost feel that it should be looked at as a wider period between the Union of the Crowns and the Union of the Parliaments
British food is shit
Yeah it was forty years ago
Now it's a world-class fusion of every cuisine you could possibly imagine (because it *was* shit)
The most famous chefs in the world are French

Absolutely lovely folk, every one of them, a couple are still good mates who I'll still go for a pint with, now and then
But every single one hated the gypsies who will steal your TV :)
It would appear Scotland, Denmark and Skåne all have at least one thing in common
Jeffrey Epstein and pizzagate are two very different things
They exist, my SIL is currently working at one, but they aren’t the same as American ones
The kids only stay one or two nights at a time, or not at all, instead heading home every day
The staff are only on 4 days at a time as well
They are quite rare
More of an American import than a tradition
Most families would rather go on a holiday together than ship the kids away for the summer
The closest we have would be things like scout week when all the troops get together for a huge event out on a country estate somewhere
Yes
We got that

Honestly, I'm really bad at this
Most of the time, I tend to stay away from dentists unless I have toothache, and then I get such remedial action taken as needs to be done
I was frightened of dentists as a child and that fear has never really gone away
Tandläkare sounds more like an orthodontist who works to fix over/under bites, squint teeth etc
For National 5 history my school did a immigration/emigration module that had a focus on the famine, then Irish emigration and then the experiences of the Irish in Scotland
(We also looked at Highland clearances, Scottish emigration as well as other groups like Eastern Europeans and Italians)
Sadly the module was a bit too big (which meant it got boring after a while considering how much time we had to spend on it) and not completely on Irish history but still gave me an insight I didn’t have
I think, like everyone is saying, it depends where they are arriving from
So, for example, if you’re coming to the UK from India or Pakistan you’ll be fine as there’s such a large community of people here from South Asia
Most cities are highly multicultural, I imagine it would be harder in rural areas and smaller towns though
We get the first Monday in May as a bank holiday not the 1st of May
Yep
I'm currently off school and  waiting for a bus and it's extremely busy .
I shower every day but rarely have baths
I have a "shower after work" job rather than a "shower before work" job if that makes sense
Oh man I have been trying to get a shower gel similar to "Erkältungsbad" for ages and it is too expensive to get anything from Germany now,I assume because of Brexit
I badly miss German groceries and some toiletries I loved
Used to get them via Amazon or eBay but now they are extortionate
Sorry for ranting, anyway we shower every other day or so but lockdown kinda made things a bit surreal and routine went out the window
Yeah, I do, but my mother is Spanish, so I just picked it up from her
It's better tha  going at it with a knife, which always pulls the toppings and cheese about and sometimes off, and a good substitute if you don't want a pizza cutter for just one dish
Quite a sensible approach imo
My parents did when I was a kid
I just use a big knife, as its way easier
Augustus, because nobody ever manages to top the guy that started the whole thing
It's also just really impressive to read about how he managed to come out as the winner of the Civil wars, going up against Antonius and Cleopatra and all that drama

My dad tried to force-feed me *Meditations* when I was younger
I stubbornly refused of course, I was 12 years old, but some of the lessons did manage to get through my skull
> They destroyed our cultures, philosophies and spiritualities
Would it really be "our" cultures
I might be the descendant of ancient Caledonians (and god knows what else), but I don't think I really share anything in common with them besides (maybe) whatver my Y-Chromosome haplogroup is
It's probably because I'm from Scotland, but "our" history (as in a people calling themselves Scots) only really begins after Christianisation really
Saint Columba converted the Picts and Gaels way back in the 6th century already, and Irish monks were renown for their writing and record keeping
Iona Abbey is supposedly the origin place of the Book of Kells (oldest book in Ireland and Britain, you can see it on display in Dublin's Trinity College)
Unlike the Greeks and Italians, our ancestors from antiquity weren't exactly bookworms, so they left us virtually nothing in terms of literary legacy
The oldest accounts of Britain aren't even from Britain, they were written by Phoenician and Greek explorers
I'm an atheist myself, but the Christian church feels a lot more familiar to me than pagan beliefs that have been mostly gone for 1500+ years
My grandmother is a practicing Christian, she's a living connection I have to that part of our history and culture, whereas the only British pagans around today are hippies who call themselves Wiccan
As mentioned, I think this sort of view varies depending on what your cultural background is
Obviously the Greeks can actually look back to their pagan ancestors and actually form a meaningful connection to that past, because it was written down
Aeschylus, Euripides, Aristophanes, Xenophon, Herodotus, etc
are all available in our libraries, but there are no equivalents from ancient Caledonia
>  I'm pro tossing Christians to lions,
St Patrick will remember that
>  I think Scottish history only coincides with Christianity as it was the Goidelic speaking Scots who brought it over from Ireland around the 5th/6th century
The Picts who were already in Caledonia were thought to be Brythonic speaking - ie more like Welsh/Cornish than the Irish (unlike modern Scottish Gaelic)
Yeah there is also that
Our connection with the ancient Picts is severed by the fact that their language was largely replaced by the invaders which we now name ourselves after
> What have the bloody Romans ever done for us
Well
Err
I guess since you are from Ireland, they really did nothing for you
Dundee
Probably unfairly, as it's improved massively, and has had one of the better local governments in Scotland for decades now, and has become something of a cultural hub
But aye, it's Dundee
Shower of minks, sorry, *shewehr ehf mehnks, eh*.
My family were losing it telling me for months I'd get chibbed immediately after leaving the train when I said I was going to Dundee for work
And they're from the most rancid shitehole parts of Glasgow, mind you
Not really for cinema, but in Scotland we have 'silicon glen', which is the home of our tech and gaming industries
Glasgow (approx
3/4 million), Edinburgh (approx
1/2 million), Aberdeen (approx
1/4 million)
**Glasgow**
Traditionally a very industrial city, it suffered a lot from the decline of industry, and rotten local government
It's improved a lot in recent years, and much of it is now a pretty decent place to live, although there remain areas of some pretty horrific poverty, and the lowest life expectancy in Western Europe
Unfortunately Glasgow has given rise to the most tedious of characters, "the professional Glaswegian", who seems to think being from Glasgow is a personality trait, for example, Janey Godley, Tony Roper, Kevin McKenna
Glasgow is neither as bad as "the professional Glaswegian" tells you when they want to gain some sort of hardman status, nor as good as "the professional Glaswegian" tells you when, yet again, they remind you they are in fact from Glasgow
**Edinburgh**
Edinburgh is the political and administrative capital
Edinburgh's old town is one of the most significant tourist draws in Scotland, and the Edinburgh Festival is Scotland's biggest cultural event
This means the city sometimes feels like it's being overwhelmed, and there is sometimes a sense that Edinburgh is not a very Scottish place
Edinburgh is undoubtedly Scotland's prettiest city, although not the only one with architectural merit, as some Edinburghers seem to think
Edinburgh society was long thought of as "the Scots Establishment" and there's still a perception that Scotland is actually run by Edinburgh doctors, lawyers and bankers doing backroom deals in their rugby club or golf club
**Aberdeen**
Aberdeen is far away from the rest of Scotland, and is often dismissed as being too cold, too windy, too grey by people that have never actually been there
It *is* cold, windy and grey, but the presence of two universities in a small city means it can be pretty lively during term-time
Aberdeen is largely focused on the oil industry, and whilst it used to be possible to make a lot of money, it also means Aberdeen is very expensive to live in, and gives poor value for what it offers
Aberdonians also speak a pretty distinct dialect, albeit one with very little media exposure, meaning the rest of the population don't understand what they're saying
Given Aberdeen's relative remoteness, Aberdonians are aware of this, but don't give a shite
Edinburgh: civilised but unfriendly
Glasgow: uncivilised but friendly
Aberdeen: uncivilised and unfriendly
Glasgow 1
8 million
Edinburgh 900k. Aberdeen 490k.
Glasgow - Known for being a bit rough and rundown due to the decline of a lot of traditional industries and failed social housing developments
Making a come back with a lot of Multinational banks, and tech companies building offices in the city, and manufacturing companies are moving back into the city with the new Glasgow Airport Industrial complex being built
People are rough but they are nice, and always happy to help if you ask (they will probably make fun of you at first but it’s just a bit of banter)
Known for being voted murder capital of Europe and nicest people in Europe in the same year
Edinburgh - The Scottish cultural Mecca
Very expensive to live in, tourists everywhere
A lot of banking and government based in the city
It’s one of my favourite cities, and a must go to place if you like architecture
City is jam packed with gothic and Neo classical structures
Known for thinking they are better than everyone else in Scotland
And known for Asking Salt and Sauce rather than salt and vinegar with your fish and chips
Aberdeen - I always compare it to the Texas of Scotland
It’s the largest city in Aberdeenshire and very wealthy
Everyone either works in oil or gas, or works in farming and estate management
People in Aberdeen are actually the one of the richest in the UK, a lot of people are on London or Edinburgh wages but only need to pay Aberdeen prices so have the most money at the end of the month
Very cheap to live in for a major city
It’s best known for Oil, Scottish Tory politicians who tend to be from the city or the Aberdeenshire area, and for the city being made out of granite (sometimes called the granite or silver city)
Aye, if you did one of these for England it would probably be fairer to compare numbers 2-4 really
> "the professional Glaswegian"
Ah, the people whose entire personality is "Ahm fae Glezga"
Yes, I hit respond too early
I've gone back and edited it
There's a reason they're currently filming the Tetris film in Aberdeen
I think because they are scared that judt adds to the;
VACCINES ARE CLEARLY BAD BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT MAKE YOU HAVE IT
THE GOVERNMENT ARE TRYING TO MAKE US ALL INFERTILE
all that anti vac shit
This is the sort of system I like, I get worried when people (on reddit) say they just want to force all vaccines on people even without the need to do so due to existing heard immunity
Well, also because in English he won't be Charles III also
East London isn't the third world
The film EuroTrip came out in 2004 with some pretty bad depictions of Slovakia
I decided to go to Slovakia in 2005 and absolutely loved it
Glasgow
Despite common depictions you're more likely to get a friendly smile and conversation from someone on the street than a stab in the kidney
I had a great time in Slovakia
Loved it
Bow, Poplar, Stepney Green, Plaistow
These are definitely not tourist hotspots
We generally bring in cakes or sweet treats on our birthdays
Additionally, we do the same when we professionally qualify too
We've been told our company will discourage this practice on return to the office to reduce the risk of passing on illnesses
I like the one between McVities (who produce the Jaffa Cake) and HM Revenue & Customs, simply because you had to have lawyers and court argue over the exact parameters of what is a cake and what is a biscuit and ultimately it became a blurry line where they had to choose which factors and combination of factors makes a cake
[It's just so wonderful and odd, I love it] just a good way to see how weird and layered VAT law is
There used to be and old beggar in Glasgow who stood with one hand out, palm up, to accept money while playing a mouth organ
The “playing” was just suck, blow, repeat without moving the instrument
I always gave him something because I appreciated the extra effort
Cheers can be used to anyone in anyway no matter how many people or how little people
I think it’s mostly confound to the UK, Ireland and parts of Australia and Canada that still have lots of connections to the UK
In school we looked at 3 poems and 3 short stories by modern Scottish writers
Then we just had to learn them and answer questions about them in the exam
By the time I was in School Shakespeare and Robert Burns had been all but pushed out in favour of more modern things
If your teacher didn’t pick poetry you would normally just read a book such as Death of Salesman or Great Gatsby
Water, irn bru, whiskey, haggis, neeps, tatties, clothes, tent, fire and a map
'Fun fivers' are a great idea, except that in the Netherlands there are 'Hier Alleen Pinnen' (i.e. cards only, no cash) signs everywhere
"I'm on my way" by the proclaimers
This song is probably more well know than the national anthem anyway
Historically La Marseillaise was widely used across Europe as a pro-democracy, pro-republican, anti-monarchist and anti-clerical song
The Chartists in the UK in the 1840s had protest songs written to the tune of La Marseillaise
It was sung by Scottish socialists in the 1919 uprising
What about *Nessun Dorma*?
In other countries that's been an iconic symbol of Italy since the 1990 World Cup
I once found myself in Paisley (of all places) quite early one winter's morning
It was one of those still, cold, clear days, when everything is frosty and crisp
All was quiet
Then I heard someone singing Nessun Dorma
It echoed through the town
I followed the sound, until I came across an old Scots-Italian man, sweeping down the street outside his shop
He was just singing to himself as he worked
But he had a voice that - with a bit of training - could have belonged to an opera singer
We are English
Probably that we're English either that or the whole "you're a fake country you don't really exist, just a British province", the first one is mostly based in ignorance which is to a large extent excusable but the second one stings a bit
On holiday in Italy a few years back, the proprietor of the apartment (who couldn't speak much English) asked if we were from "Inghilterra". I acted semi-insulted and said "No, no - Scozia
" and she just waved her hand and said "Ahhh
*is the same*!"
Never been so insulted in my life
Holiday ruined
I once said to someone that I'm from Scotland
Their response
"Scotland
In England
I feel you brother
I don't think we mind being called British, after we are British
We are still part of the U.K.
It's when folk call us English it gets to us
Something inside you starts boiling
You feel the need to take up arms
You feel the need for freedom
Tbh I'd rather not be called British if you don't have to and most Scots are probably somewhat similar
It's not going to create a violent response though
Yes, a lot of people call the U.K England
It is wrong
U.K is made up of four countries, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and England
It's just kinda ignorant calling the whole of the U.K, England
I know a lot of people do it, it just gets to me
> To be fair, she didn't mean to say you are from England
right
Thanks
On an unrelated subject, does anyone know how to remove a 0 star review from TripAdvisor
Yes, some don't like being British, but CURRENTLY we are British
It could all change soon
Ireland is a very unique place
Some feel very strongly about wanting a united, independent Ireland
Others like being part of the U.K.
It's a troubled place sometimes, at least now it's not as bad as it once was
It's religion based in Ireland I think
The independent republic of Ireland is very catholic and Northern Ireland is protestant
If your grandmother is catholic I see why she doesn't like being called British
Wars have been fought for centuries between different Irish groups and parties against the U.K.
I'm not an expert by any case but I know the majority of Catholics in Ireland do not like being called British
Eh i mean kind of
We're British in the same way Puerto Ricans are americans
90% is far too optimistic imo
I'd say a solid third of the population is unsure exactly what the political situation is on the island of Ireland
Amongst a bunch of other things, I get about 1000 Euros a year to use for personal and professional development training
I've used it twice in seven years
One year I used it for private Arabic lessons
Another year I used it to give a paper at a conference in the Caribbean
It's a sweet perk
I have a company phone and the only time I'm expected to be permanently available is the week I'm being paid to be on call
&nbsp;
Although our newest phones have dual sim and my boss was banging on about how great it is, then went onto tell a story about how he was sitting on the beach in Cape Verde and got a work call, tried to tell the guy he was on holiday
then proceeded to be stuck on the phone to the guy for an hour
Yeah no thanks I think I'll keep my work and personal phones separate
Just as well seeing as you don't get parental leave either lol
It can happen on the last and second last trains home from Glasgow
But those are typically the ‘drunk trains’ and everyone is pretty full of it and in the mood for a sing song
I was getting a metro in Madrid a couple of hours after Atletico had won the Europa league
fans were singing chants and banging on the roof

The accents within the UK are harder for me to understand than Aussie/kiwi/us accents
I worked in England for a while and I'd have to rephrase what I'm saying so they could understand me

And *HERBS* my god it makes my toes curl whenever I hear "URBAL TEA"
1314 - Battle of Bannockburn
This defined Scottish identity and independence thereafter with the Declaration of Arbroath (which the US Declaration of Independence is based on) with little subjugation on Scotland by foreign powers and self determination for Scotland
I would’ve argued Culloden was more defining for the country itself considering it’s what caused a purge of Scottish culture
I’d say Bannockburn if you were looking for defining our place on the world stage
Everyone knows us as the freedom guys thanks to that
Arguably it was the decimation of Highlander culture not lowlander as they developed separately
> Literally every person in Britain can tell you about the battle of Hastings and the Normans etc
It's national myth and origin story
Sorry to be *that guy* but it was never taught in my school in Scotland
The only English/pre-British history I was taught was the whole Scotland vs England thing in the middle ages
There are only 4 foods that I can really think of as being “Scottish”, or associated with Scotland: fish & chips, which is a UK wide thing so doesn’t count (and is also delicious); deep fried Mars bars, which are honestly more of a meme than a cultural dish; haggis, which is WAY better than descriptions of it make it sound, and tablet
Tablet is like a kind of hard fudge, and it’s disgustingly sweet
It tastes like someone found a way to bake with only sugar
I'm not a fan of haggis, black pudding, or bacon
Just no keen on them, really don't understand the obsession with bacon
As they say, 'If you want to eat well in the Netherlands, go to Belgium
It’s so fucking strange
People act like going to Nando’s is like some big event like going to the cinema or something, but it’s just cheap junk food
The company doesn’t even pretend it isn’t, but for some reason people are completely obsessed with it
The Dutch can't cook, but they can bake
Baking requires precision, science, calculation - all things the Dutch are good at
Cooking requires flair, passion, love, recklessness - all things the Dutch are bad at
I always associate it with England cause I’ve never had it or seen it, or even seen it on a menu or in shops
Yeah, that's the thing, you can find local cafes or even takeaways with burgers that you'll enjoy just as much in the UK
Five Guys is still good, but it is also a bit extortionate given its competition
But then, that seems to be my experience with the chains, pizza or burger, you tend to get nicer food for as much or less if you just go looking for some good independent takeaways and cafes in your city
Balkan hospitality
"Oh, hi, please, eat with us"
- "oh, that's very kind of you, but I've already eaten"
"Well, just have some bread"
- "you don't have to really, I'm not hungry"
[Granny stare] "**have
some
bread
**"
You're not wrong but I do think that's largely the older generation
Younger folk are generally more aware about mental health issues, in my experience at least
I think it's simply awareness and communication more than anything
Previously we had all that stiff upper lip nonsense, particularly with guys and people are talking more these days
Mental health issues are a lot more common than some people realise; I was actually a missing person for a couple of days so my troubles were *very* public and the amount of people that came forward on social media, either publically or in messenger was unreal
Even some of the most "has their shit together" people were coming forward and telling me about their crippling anxiety or depression, addictions, a surprising amount of bipolar people and all sorts of other conditions
The internet is probably a big factor too
It's a lot easier to find information and relevang help and there's much less of a taboo around therapy and support groups now
Don’t know any outside Glasgow but the People’s Palace, Kelvingrove, and the Riverside Museum are all nice
Highland Folk Museum
It tries to give something of an idea of the actual make up of Highland life, how the houses looked and functioned, and the types of home activities and schooling that functioned up in the north west
It's just a very different feeling museum, being an open air museum
I quite liked it, it's a different approach but it ultimately works by involving you slightly in things, milling oats and cooking them into oatcakes in peat-smoked thatched housing, etc
> , more specifically it was created in Scotland,
Well shit
Here I was, reading this thread, being disgusted by this abominable "cuisine", only to find out we fucking dun it
Well, we are the (first or second
) fattest country in Europe :/
I'm surprised tbh
I imagined somewhere in Latin America would be the second biggest consumer of anime
Dragonball is *huge* in LATAM
>I am jealous
Don't be, Pizza Hut is an abomination
For Sure Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland
The further north you go the more likely people are to consider Norway or Denmark a kind of neighbor too
Malta
Maybe
I don't know, I found them all very neighbourly to a visiting Scot
It did feel kinda like popping next door, much as there were many differences
Give the Isle of Man some love, stuck in amongst us all but so often forgotten
Probably because it's got a similar population to Paisley
Wasn't there also concern about German ports on the channel, given the naval race that had preceded the war, as well
Not wanting German fleets a skip and a hop away from British territory
So, roughly a third of the Highlands
Remember them, or we'll ally and invade the lowlands once more
That's only if you have a pretty strict definition of the highlands
Everything’s a hell of a lot dearer
Also a lot of parts are pretty fancy and posh in Edinburgh
That's usually how the inter-city rivalry jokes from weegies go
Edinburgh is mostly all posh English people
Just that one privately educated English accent everywhere
No Doric, no brummie, no scouse, no weegie, etc
It’s a shite state of affairs and Edinburgh doesn’t really feel Scottish for that reason below surface level
From Finland and your father worked in WRC

I climbed Alicante Castle Santa Barbara in the height of summer, then spent ages looking over the gorgeous water and old town drinking an ice cold beer as the sun set
I done that in early May so it wasn't as warm as it is in the height of summer
Still had cracking views though when I got to the top
And cheap beer
[The ice cream van drivers] were at it in the '80s!
That might me the most Scottish thing I have seen today
I’m not gonna answer for the UK, cause yall already know the answer, but from Scotland specifically probably Orkney and Shetland
They used to be Norwegian territories, and still maintain a decidedly Nordic identity
I don’t think successions is at all likely, but of everywhere in Scotland they are the most likely
I would say Shetland
Different history and geographically separated
Probably Shetland, I don't know much at all about the place but they do seem to almost feel more Nordic than Scottish at times
Also Glasgow, quite a few Glaswegians claim everything Scottish as specifically Glaswegian for some reason so they probably feel like their own unique place already
Except the last time anyone asked less than 10% of the population wanted to secede
Seems vanishingly unlikely
London would yeet itself out of England if it could mate, gie yersel peace
I'm curious as to how Scotland wouldn't be able to afford independence
We're no poorer than Ireland
My dad comes from Orkney so I’ve visited it a lot, and I swear Magnus is by far the most common mans name there
It’s weird
You might also find [the flag] a bit familiar
> Although if I lived in Northumberland/Cumbria I'd be tempted to try and join an independent Scotland
What about the Northern Independence Party, they're a great bunch of lads
Also, their logo has a whippet in it
There was a huge shift in votes to the SNP in Shetland recently, suggesting there isn't much support for breaking from Edinburgh
No, I’ve never seen stray dogs in the UK
A lone dog running around the streets would be assumed as lost and would be reported as such
I don't think so there are a few nieberhood cats that "roam free" . I live in a built up area so I'm not sure but I think in the country (Highlands and Islands) it would be deer you need to watch for
Surely that would simply be Lands End in Cornwall
Certainly black ink
Many official forms and documents specify that they must be completed in black ink only
I work in the national health service and it’s black ink only for everything
You do occasionally get forms here that specify blue ink, probably for the same reason I imagine
When we get independence, I’m sure it’ll be our official ink ;)
> speech-to-text
No chance with my accent
Did you go to a posh school or is this an English thing in general
At my school they were happy enough as long as we actually brought something to write with
I believe only a lawyer can notorise a document in Scotland
I know it's a bit more open in the States based on what I've seen in films and the telly
The thing is, if I'm speaking to non-native English speakers they'll understand me 99% of the time with my accent (I switch to using standard English words obviously), but in the south of England there's a very high chance of "u wot, m8
" as soon as I open my mouth
I've had non-Scots describe my accent as "neutral Scottish" (i.e. I'm from somewhere in the middle that's not quite as well known
) so I've no idea if that helps
For very young children you do see it but it's really just an excuse for the adults to get together
Not really
We did study Scots a bit through Robert Burns and there's a bit of a debate whether Scots is a language in itself or a dialect of English
We did study some dialects of Spanish when learning that language though like Catalan
In Scotland it's common to study Robert Burns' poems around Burns night or St Andrews day (think Auld Lang Syne)
But I'd say the Scots dialect is taken a lot less seriously than the Gaelic language (see also the Scots Wikipedia debacle)
Gaelic is offered as a subject in many schools, especially on the west coast
There are also a fair number of schools which teach entirely in Gaelic (which means a fair chunk of the curriculum including exams are offered in the language
Also, our dialects aren't actually that difficult for the most part to pick up, they usually don't vary too dramatically
See more people struggling with the heavier accents than the dialect, which you just pick up bit by bit of you talk and travel to people
Do you have a sort of "Standard" Irish in the way that we've got Mid-Minch Gaelic as a sort of "BBC Gàidhlig"?
Weirdly enough, my parents did Burns at school for a week in January
and then the rest of the year they went back to getting the strap if they spoke Scots in class
I'm too young to have got the belt but I also went through the whole "Scots is forbidden except one week in January in Primary 7".
In my case giving us a row or ridiculing us
I remember my primary 6 teacher standing a boy at the front of the class and trying to make everyone laugh at him
High school was a bit more tolerant on the whole
Previous generations would have had it worse though, and it’s been horrific for Gaelic speakers
Scots was never outright banned - the people that took against it so would never admit it *existed*.
Children in schools in my parents generation would be beaten by teachers with a leather strap called a 'Lochgelly' for speaking Scots, because it was seen as speaking 'bad english' and the language of the gutter
It's worth noting that this wasn't really an English imposition on Scotland, rather a British classist imposition by Scots on other Scots
Whilst it's arguable that in a school where the language of instruction is english, teachers should not be addressed in Scots, being overheard speaking Scots to one another in class often got a sharp word from the teacher
I speak Scots and consider it my first language but rarely read/write it if that makes sense
I've also been learning Gaelic recently, although I don't live in a recently Gaelic speaking area
We can't really blame anyone else for how we've treated Scottish Gaelic over here, anti-Gaelic attitudes pre-date the Act of Union so it's all down to us in our case
Walkers cheese and onion crisps with butter
Butter, choped pork, salt and pepper, cheddar, red sauce

This is the only right answer
Top tip, mix Cheesy Wotsits and smoky bacon crisps, it's food of the gods
Get out
Life-changing mate honest
There's a decent number of Scottish wide institutions based in Glasgow which makes sense given it's bigger than the capital
In the UK as a whole they're trying to move things North a bit particularly to Manchester and Birmingham
&#x200B;
EDIT: Also to keep the nuclear missiles safe and away from population they moved it away from England and sat almost all of the UK's nuclear command and arsenal right next to the biggest city in Scotland
Don't know how to compare to US, but would think similarish to how London is a sort of gaping blackhole in the UK that sucks everything into it
Except France doesn't have the minor decentralising effects of being made of the four home nations
They are very heavily centralised
"Iphigenie auf Tauris" (Iphigenia in Tauris) from Goethe
I just found it so boring
The Cone Gatherers by Robin Jenkins, I don't even think it's a bad book, I just hated reading it
Nah, Abi '14
Yeah I never knew about that connection
The Italians did not speak with their hands
Very dissatisfied
I've been to Germany a few times and the stereotype "they will reply in English even if you try German" held true in most cases
except for when it didn't. My husband and I both have some competence with German but not enough to sustain a proper conversation beyond greetings, ordering stuff and generally being polite
But we also apparently have enough competence that people will talk back to us in German, sometimes using slang or turns of phrase we're not used to
But overall we (usually) understand what is being said to us but can't think of a reply fast enough
it has led to some pretty embarrassing times on our part where we end up giving up and reverting to English
Lake Garda wasn't too bad for driving imo
Some other tourists freaked out around the lake because of the twisty nature of the roads but other than getting stuck behind a tractor it was ok
Did not drive in Rome but don't know why anyone would as even wandering around as a pedestrian it was like a symphony of angry horns and terrible options for parking
Just spent two weeks in Portugal with a week of car hire and would recommend for all your insane driver needs
They've got extreme tailgating to the point of trying to go into the central reservation, they've got dangerous overtakes, they've got squeezing in front of someone without an indicator after a potentially dangerous overtake
I'm also fairly sure the speed limit doesn't actually exist because it felt like everyone not in a hire car, HGV or car that is almost as old as me was doing at least 150 km/h. We were often doing a little over 120 km/h and it still wasn't enough for some people
The mutes must also have double arm amputations
We had to drive in and out of Verona a couple of times and that alone was worse than around the lake
We didn't keep the car when we headed to Florence the week afterward, and like Rome that's another place where I feel a tourist would need to be out of their mind to try and drive around it
Three mass shootings in the last 24 hours
I mean seriously
There's "Muh guns" but there's also clearly some serious mental health problems going on and people have to decide if they can afford to be treated
Can you even imagine lying at the side of the road after an accident, asking people not to phone an ambulance because you can't afford it
Fucking bizarre mindset to think that's acceptable
Low key bragging that you speak 3 languages
To many English speakers like myself speaking 3 languages seems quite impressive
I wish I had a better French teacher in elementary school
We didn't have a choice with French, as I did my schooling in Canada
Unfortunately all the teachers that we had throughout primary school were absolutely terrible, one of them didn't even speak French
I did a German course in secondary but I definitely can't speak German
I definitely have a better understanding of German than French though and I'm trying to learn German again now
Yeah I know it's ridiculous
He also didn't know if he was supposed to be teaching Quebecois or Parisian French
Finnish if it counts
If not Danish, as a celt I'm obligated to appreciate anyone who speaks with a potato in their mouth at all times
YES
BBC Scotland, essentially a branch of the BBC just for us
I always forget when to place a comma
I'm still not completely sure
I'm speaking on more of a dialect and I don't know how much my answer is gonna fit but I'd say the fact that it's been watered down a lot and sort of seems like it's still fading away
I remember once my cousin was up with his son and he said something about his "jaikit" (jacket) and his son had no clue what he was talking about
It's little things like that which is sad to see
I've noticed as well my great Auntie who's 95 uses other words that I don't hear at all anymore other than from her like and other right old people "ingin" for onion or "gan" for go and stuff like that
I guess maybe in other areas these words might be more prevalent but it's still a kind of worrying thought in case Scots is just gonna continue getting watered down
It's already looked on as slang/lower class speech by upper class people
I hate english cause even I can’t speak English sometimes when I’m ranting
It really needs to be taught in schools and maybe a Language Academy to make words and spellings standard, but then there is so much dialect variety it would be hard (and not right) to make a ‘Standard Scots’ that would be taught in schools
Also Gaelic shouldn’t be being promoted before Scots in the lowlands
Eh, I'd say the promotion of Gaelic is warranted since that's doing a lot worse than Scots but I see what you mean
I also kind of suspect it might be due to American media and all that because I've noticed one of my nieces says "tomorrow" like "tomarrow" and Americans tend to kind of say it like that, so if it can affect kids here like that then it wouldn't surprise me if it affects the vocabulary they use/don't use
That's probably a fair sized stretch as well but oh well
I agree Gaelic should be promoted as a national language and espically in the highlands, but Scots should be promoted more than Gaelic in the lowlands
I think everywhere is getting American-ised
A lot of my friends using things like ‘trash’ all the time
Gaelio-Celtic Union
Scotland and England
Pretty chill, I think
England: No thanks
We've been playing that game for 312 years
Ireland: It might take a bit of constitutional wrangling to sort out the details, but it would be fine
Just over 300 hundred years of Union
Starting to fray a bit, mind
Just do it now please
No offence but I doubt you guys would treat us any better than the English
The Scots basically already own your islands haha
Just the thought of that makes me feel ill
The pizza, I'm used to being ignored
Thank you
I know the answer to this
Non lo so
My dad had Sibelius' *Finlandia* on vinyl, and the photo on the cover showed very mountainous scenery, so I assumed that Finland must also be mountainous
I've no idea where the photo on the cover was of, but it certainly wasn't Finland
Edit: this is the cover
Whilst Finland does have isolated mountains in the North, they don't look like the ones in the photo
I used to think that people in Switzerland spoke Swiss and that Belgian people spoke Belgian
When my sister was younger, if she didn’t know where a place was she decided it was a city in Russia
I don’t really know why
Serbia - city in Russia (close to Siberia so understandable for her age)
Vietnam - city in Russia
Cuba - city in Russia
Bosnia & Herzegovina - cities in Russia
Malta - city in Russia
Moscow - country near Russia
Oh my god
Are you me
I was *utterly* ***convinced*** of the same thing
> England, Soctland and Wales were independent countries
Not yet ;)

Tbh, for a while this was true
Well theres the glenfinnan viaduct that's cool, any number of castles but I'd go Doune cz monty python
theres loch ness and loch lomond those guys are cool
And probably one which is an incredible marvel of engineering but

The Falkirk wheel
I used to think that sign-language was the some, until I was told that every country has a different sign language
Which still feels like a missed opportunity to me
Finland isn't Scandinavian, it's Nordic
Finland is mostly rolling forest, interrupted by lakes, and the odd moraine ridge, with isolated low mountains in the North
That's a very logical trap
My tooth fairy trap involved lots of string and a weight that would wake me up to "see her" when she tried to take it so I could ask for double since it was an "adult tooth" that fell out and it should be worth more for it, since I'd never get a replacement for it
*(For some reason my right I-tooth fell out as soon as it came in, but my mother never believed that it was an adult tooth until the dentist asked why it was missing a couple of years later)*
Stupidly I told my mother all about it and she "helped" me set it up
Such that she just brought scissors and cut the string so I didn't notice
The Kelpies are smashin right enough
But the duke was a dunt and Nessie isnt a monument shes a sweet old girl who jist wants some privacy

The UK Supreme Court has 12 judges
An odd number of judges have to hear each case, so the maximum to sit on one case is 11 - which has only happened twice
Scotland has two Supreme Courts - the Court of Session for civil law and the High Court of  Justiciary for criminal law
Judges for these Courts are known as Senators of the College of Justice and there are currently 36 of them
It’s a great building, isn’t it
Did you see the advocates walking around Parliament Hall
Hope you enjoyed your moot - did you get a Senator to preside
They’re usually very open to do that for moots - especially international ones
You’re quite right that the Supreme Court is the final court of appeal for civil matters in Scotland
But the Court of Session and High Court of Justiciary are known as the Supreme Courts in Scotland - see, for example, the Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service [website ]
I know this doesn't really fit but I thought some people might find it interesting;
in some areas we sometimes say "two" exactly how it's spelt, like "twoh". I've noticed though (at least for my area) it's never if you're counting or something, it's only if you're saying something like "the two of them". It's not that common though unfortunately
I also think some areas might say "twa" but I'm not too sure about that
edit: The "oh" in "twoh" is more pronounced like "aw"
During my many years of learning French at school in the UK I hated the whole "quatre-vingt-dice-neuf" nonesnese
It was just super counter-intuitive to me
I eventually just looked it up online and started using the "alternative" numberings of huitante etc
I memorised a phrase in French explaining to the teacher about how I thought it was a more eloquent way of describing numbers for oral tests, and since it was considered like "American vs British English" differences to her, she let me get away with it
Phew

Red Hot Chilli *Pipers*!
Well, you learn something new everyday
Don't know *why* I didn't know it, mind you
They got famous from doing piping and Scottish covers of famous songs, so the name is a reference to the Peppers
They're pretty famous outside of Scotland now
I assume that's an accent thing
A lot of people who aren't used to some Scottish accents think they sound very Irish
Just about the same as Spain
Have small talk like that with cashier workers, bus drivers, taxi drivers etc
I used to love that as a kid
Alles Klar in Germany just means Did you get that / any questions
In Austria it was usually dismissive, somewhere between Did I fucking stutter and is anyone here so stupid that I have to spell it out and draw a diagram
Caveat: I have left Austria a long time ago and the language seems to have gotten much more Germanised
Giving out

We'd use "rare day" to mean good weather
Presumably because good weather is rare in Scotland
In this case, it's not so much a phrase as "something that would be understood to mean
Not really sure tbh, I don't have numbers
I rarely meet anyone who can actually grow a good one
Slow start, hint at good performances in the second half of matches
Go out in the first round and be left to rue missed opportunities
Scotland fans have had all optimism beaten out of them, despite the national euphoria of finally qualifying
This is a marked change from the 60s, 70s and 80s when we always assumed we'd win the thing, despite all evidence to the contrary
(The days of "premature-jock-elation" are over)
No expectation really
Hopefully beat the English and hold our own
I think we can get out of the Group
Haha, funny joke
About as well as they always do; lot of mediocre games, one or two crowning moments of glory to make us hopeful again
Then bombing out in spectacular fashion, leaving us to support our fallback of ABE
Most Austrians I’ve seen talk about their NT seem to be really negative, I mean I’ve seen some say they think we’ll finish above you in the WCQ haha
Me and you are in the same boat mate
Although I’d say our squad is a little stronger haha ;)
Good luck to North Macedonia this summer
Mbappe, Müller and Ronaldo will all retire when they see Gulasci
This is a bit unrelated but how is Shaun Maloney thought of in Belgium
He has been heavily linked with the Celtic job and the Aberdeen job before they got a new manager
Martinez is one of the favourites for the Celtic job too lol
I like Isak, Kulusevski, Ibra etc
but I really want to see Larsson play for Sweden
He’s doing great for Spartak but I heard Janne Anderson doesn’t really like him - any reason for that
Seen a couple comments like this
I genuinely don’t even know of any other European Championships other than the football ones
Slovenia didn’t qualify but why do you want them to do badly
If you don’t like football fine but it brings joy to so many
> if we win a game in our group I will be happy
That will be a challenge - Ireland didn't qualify
There's no way we're making it out of the group stages - Scotland are the weakest team in that group, and we're not playing very well at all at the moment
Would be one of the best days of my life if we beat England
Last time we played we dominated them but Harry Kane scored 90th minute to knock us out the World Cup qualifiers
Thanks for the well wishes
Hope Sweden do well too
Have to want Henke’s country to do well
Last game we played in European Championship competition we won btw
[should have won 4-0 too]
Football
Iceland missed out this year and OP of the comment doesn’t need to worry as Scotland will be knocking them out
Yeah Sweden have a really great team I just want to see him called up because he’s the King’s son hahaha
Thanks for the info
You’ll need to hope Australia make the 2022 World Cup because Ireland aren’t going to that either haha
Is the football one really not the one that comes to mind first tho seriously
All those combined probably aren’t half as popular as the football one
I never even knew the rugby was on, only found out when our (Celtic) CEO tweeted about it and I don’t know anyone who likes rugby so I kinda missed that one haha
I’d take going out if we beat you and you came home with us
Pretty sure the European Championships in football has a far bigger audience than all those mate
You didn’t specify in Austria there mate
Yeah fair enough I couldn’t tell you what ones most viewed in the one above’s country but football is Austria’s national sport so it’s a decent guess
You were replying about my reply to an Austrian flair but
I was just surprised people didn’t realise OP was talking about the football one because it’s a European wide sub and I thought most people would see the football European Championship as the biggest and most popular one, that is all
No I wasn’t surprised that there are European Championships outside of football, but I didn’t know about any of them other than the basketball one lol and that’s only because I like basketball which is very very rare in my country
German for sure
Scots Gaelic
I like Spanish, but that might just be purely due to hearing family speak it for most of my life
You hear it a lot walking around Edinburgh, Manchester, etc, so it's always quite pleasant when you hear snippets
I liked Italy
Went with a friend, she knew French and Spanish and a few Italian words, people just took it as a strange dialect, was wonderful
Great country, seemed very relaxed about language
I don't speak Scots Gaelic
Just English and Scots (if you consider it a languge)
Edward the 1st of England
He’s celebrated as bringing Wales under the control of the English crown and being a very powerful/successful ruler
He was known as the “hammer of Scots” so you can guess how he’s viewed here
Well yeah
Millions starved in labour camps in the USSR
Thatcher stole the lunches  of striking miners
There's a lot in common
What angle should I take here
I'm a native English speaker so we need to be worried if it gets so popular it disappears
Gaelic has going petting strong as a second language we are fine
To the point we have to invent Gaelic names for road signs that historically never spoke it
There's already a few dead tounges I can't even remember the name of as despite being native arent english or garlic
At least your education system bothers telling you it even exists
Part of the problem with Scottish Gaelic (and something similar with Irish, although I am not familiar with Irish history) is the fact that it was forced out during the highland clearances
It was [outlawed in 1616] and after the Jacobite rebellion in 1745 it was pushed down further
Banning of kilts, Gaelic, anything “Scottish” caused a huge decline in every part of our culture
I agree the Scottish government hasn’t done a good job of reintroducing it, but the language hasn’t been naturally replaced by English, it was forced out to be replaced, which is part of the cause of its decline
They're responsible for the now worldwide fashion of men wearing material draped around the neck on formal occasions
This one for sure
I'm a little worried about the future, the present is the best time yet to be alive but I'd probably choose to be born in the 1950s so I'd see the present day, not have to worry too much about the future and still live in a pretty good time
Well I the Yu-Gi-Oh thing instead of guns people just pointed at people
Depends
Sometimes Western Europe, sometimes Northern Europe
I’m sure if you asked Shetland they’d try to say they’re Scandinavian
Although there’s also the group that would claim Britain and Ireland are a unique region of Europe
Western Europe, British isles, And debatably Northern Europe
I mean, I’m pretty sure we’re further north than Denmark so I think that qualifies as Northern Europe
The question of whether we are part of Europe at all is, sadly, still being debated
The islands which some people do refer to as "British Isles" and some people do not refer to as "British Isles".
I believe they are referring to brexit, but even outside of that the British isles are sometimes not considered European
I’ve actually had a few people on this site tell me I’m not European, which is mildly frustrating
Well, we are being dragged out of the EU against our will
So as a Scottish European it's a bit of a sore point

I am currently living in Korea, so you must always take your shoes off 100% of the time in a house
You also take them off in lots of restaurants, offices and schools
Back in Scotland, I operated the same rule
No shoes inside, only slippers/socks/bare feet
It makes cleaning much less work and keeps carpets/rugs in better condition
Rolls on Square sausage seem to blow visitors minds
Brummie mate : wtf is that
Me : Roll on sausage (stuffing my gob)
Brummie: it's square
Me: aye square sausage
Brummie : is it haggis
I lost it at that point and got him one, he ended up going home with 2 bricks of it
Oh sorry Brummies are from Birmingham

It's pretty cheesy but Scots can't help get teary eyed at it
I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles) by the Proclaimers
(Scotland) The Bonnie Banks o Loch Lomond is an extremely popular song in Scotland
Loch Lomond is our biggest loch and is regarded with great affection by many
The song's most popular rendition is probably that by Runrig, which has a chorus in Gaelic (ho mo leannan bhoideach) added to it:
It's also often sung at the football:
- [Auld Lang Syne]
- [Scotland the Brave]
Loch Lomond
An absolute belter of a way to end a Wedding Party
Loch Lomond for sure, aside from being a beautifully descriptive song, I used to work at a wedding venue and at the end of every single wedding, what’s left of the party -or who was left standing- gather into a circle around the dance floor, link arms and sing and sway along while the bride and groom dance in the middle, it’s the most Scottish thing, especially because no one ever has to be instructed on what to do, you hear the opening of the song and just immediately find someone to link arms with
Dougie McClean's Caledonia
He said besides our national anthem
It's worth pointing out that those are primarily songs with meaning to English people, there are not really any songs of this type that are shared across the whole UK any more
>the ketchup song
Taking me back to my Primary 3 school disco with that
It's a Scottish band who sing in a Scottish accent
Inside Scotland people usually live it just because it's a great tune, but Scottish people in particular I've found get weirdly patriotic for Scottish stuff when we leave
Is it all our added swearing
Yeah, but probably pre 1950s or WW2: very much regarded as an imperialistic sounding song these days
No problem
Should I stay or should I go
It's an unusual food that most people I think have tried once or twice
Mostly in Scotland duck and venison are seen as fine dining dishes (if it's not some kind of duck from a chinese take away anyway)
Rabbit is less common but I've had it, not frequently or recently or but I know where I can get some if I get a craving
I don't think I'd be surprised to hear that there is some dish or something including rabbit, but I don't think I've ever heard of or seen anyone eating rabbit before
Scots has been slowly getting watered down for probably hundreds of years and it looks like it's still actively fading between the generations, at least with some kids anyway
Honestly I don't know how it's looked at now in schools but in school you'd get taught that some words aren't the "right" words like it's just bad English but it's actually just Scots words
The one that surprised me the most was jamp for jumped, because I've always genuinely thought that was just an actual one where jamp was never a word and just invented by kids trying to understand language (sort of like how some might come up with "gived" instead of "gave") and for some reason stuck with some people into adulthood, but as it turns out it's just a Scots word
It's even the tiny subtle things like that which are contributing to Scots fading away
I feel like constant American media consumption isn't helping at all either, my niece started calling a bin a "trash can" and my other one goes about saying tomorrow like tomarrow like an American
Still in a Scottish accent but it's that letter change of the 2nd o
edit since I forgot something to include: my youngest niece is at the age where she's just getting the hang of reading and when she was sounding out the letters of a word, everytime she came across an r she would do that flat r instead of a tapped one, and I remember when I was learning how to read we got taught that r sounded like "rih" so the tapped noise was still there, but now it's just "rrrr"
edit again: there are efforts done by people to try and preserve Scots, but some of it's done by upper class people who don't even speak that way and they go about trying to push a way that no one's even spoken for probably like a hundred years *at least* and most of it just doesn't sound natural at all, it's sort of like saying you can speak English but then go and start speaking middle English
Gaelic is still spoken in parts of the Highlands and in some islands, it's not really a thing in the Lowlands any more (other than learners and migrants)
In some of these areas I believe the number of young speakers is actually starting to increase due to Gaelic Medium Education
There are a variety of Gaelic dialects but Mid-Minch Gaelic is becoming a sort of "standard Gaelic".
In the Lowlands, Shetland, and Orkney a lot of people speak their own dialects of Scots, and even more people speak some sort of hybrid English/Scots depending on the context
Young people do still speak it but as is usually the case with these things it's becoming less common and the local dialects are becoming less distinct
Edit: I forgot about the Travellers, I believe some of them have their own language
Scottish gaelic is spoke in the highlands and islands
Well throughout the whole of the highlands it still seems a bit uncommon
From what I can tell just looking at a map on the percentages, there aren't any parts of the highlands where more than 50% of the population speaks it
> I have a question for you
Just how important are these languages for the Scottish culture and identity
For Scots I guess it's fair to say it's a fair deal in culture/identity in working class areas, not so much so in middle/upper class, they'll just put it down as being nothing more than slang
Even some people in the working class areas do that too, but at least slang they're proud of if you get what I mean
To be fair though it is an unformal way of talking so it would fit in with the definition of slang
With r/ScottishPeopleTwitter becoming popular though there are people who don't even talk this way that go about trying to online and it just doesn't feel right at all
As for Gaelic it's not really got an impact on as much people at all, certainly not for me anyway so I can't really effectively speak on it
Only like 1% of the population speaks it anymore and they're all mostly in the islands/highlands, mostly the islands
It's one of those things I guess where if we can preserve it we should, but I'm not exactly shitting my pants at it or anything
Culturally it's got nothing to do with most of us but that doesn't mean we should leave out the small percentage where it does
The government has made an effort to revive it by making it standard for gaelic to be on things like police cars/ambulances (just "police" or "ambulance" in gaelic) and I'm pretty sure it's getting taught all around Scotland now too, I could be wrong on that though but at least more widespread than what it used to be
To the best of my knowledge every Gaelic speaker is fluent in English
To hear them speak English you wouldn't necessarily know that they were even Gaelic speakers other than the occasional Gaelic loanword or slightly different grammar from standard English
The loanwords and grammar are also found in non Gaelic speakers who live in those areas
Scots can be a strange one
Many speakers would deny it's even a thing, I suspect those people would be less likely to code switch than someone who recognises the language as something different if that makes sense
I'm a Scots speaker myself but I'll switch to standard English depending on who I'm speaking to
My entire schooling has been in English after all
No idea about the travellers to be honest
At least three separate groups (although I've probably missed some), Romani/Gypsies, Irish Travellers, Highland/Scottish Travellers
I think there's a regional element to Scots being seen as distinct
I'm from Aberdeenshire and most people there would acknowledge Doric as being a clearly defined dialect and most people would code-switch to some extent, whereas say a Glaswegian dialect is often treated more as just the way you speak and not as its own thing
Correct
There's very little Scots influence out that way at all except Campbeltown, but I believe that's due to plantation of lowlanders a few centuries ago (this seems to be a recurring thing
It's a weird one eh
It's not even a unionist vs nationalist thing necessarily, you get both mentalities on both sides
keep in mind though, *some* scots that gets pushed is the type of scots that isn't even spoken anymore, only by people who actively learn it
Out of curiosity how would they pronounce it
To throw a spanner in the works there's "aw-ven" from some Fifers and Taysiders
While everyone is aware of William Wallace, thanks to a certain movie, it was actually Robert the Bruce who won Scotland's independence
> But no king could be picked because of trivial issues like which flags to use
That's quite funny
Imagine declining the throne of France because you can't be arsed to accept the tricolour as a flag
Well, if you believe in violent revolution being a necessity, that entails killing your opponents as well
> A communist revolution doesn't wish harm on people
But when you define anyone who doesn't tow the party line as "reactionary bourgeois fascists", it's kind of hard to believe that
Not even other Communists are spared; Trotsky got the Ice pick from Stalin, Mao accused the Soviets of being revisionists, Tito nearly got Ice-picked by Stalin
> When have I ever done that
Perhaps you personally haven't, but it's not a secret that historically speaking, Communist revolutionaries have a habit of doing that
Trotsky, Lenin, Castro, etc
were not shy about saying it either, they were very vocal about denouncing their opponents as "Fascists".
>They thought it necessary in the moment
Well there lies the problem
"Oh killing thousands of people was just necessary, woe is me, I didn't want to execute them but they just so happened to disagree with me
" The death penalty is already barbaric in itself, even if it's used against "those who deserve it" (e.g. someone like Anders Breivik)
Trying to justify its use against people for disagreeing politically is pure savagery
>And to be quite honest, you would never use the same standards for capitalist systems, anyway
If deadly infighting in historical expressions was a black mark against an ideology for you, you wouldn't be able to defend capitalism for even a second
I don't have to worry about Angela Merkel or Macron hiring hitmen to eliminate the leaders of the SPD or the PS
Honestly, Glasgow has a pretty good foreign food scene
Italian, Chinese and Indian are probably the three most popular and that is likely as a result of those nationalities being our biggest ex-pat communities in 20th century
Sushi and Ramen are becoming more popular
We have a fair few Spanish and Greek restaurants
A few Turkish restaurants have popped up in the last few months (and the one I ate in on Saturday was fantastic)
We have a couple of Mexican restaurants (one of which is amazing) and a couple of Vietnamese and Thai places too
Glasgow's international food scene is really quite good, which may surprise some of you
Lots of Japanese, Chinese and about a million Indian take aways
Also got some Jamaican foods which are class
it's probably all gonna be in some form of a chippy
We have loads of continental European food like Italian
But we have some Caribbean food mostly brought over from when loads of people came here after WW2 as the UK needed people to help rebuild after the war, so a lot of colonial people left the home countries like Jamaica and India and brought there great food to bless us with

I'm sure theres more but they're what spring to mind
A more modern translation, but with minimal changes to the original translation, would simply swap ‘where’ and ‘there’. It still sounds old fashioned, but not archaic
(It’s a slightly different sense of the word ‘there’, it’s not just a change of word order)
Quite Positive
We knew we would have England (should we qualify)
We have beaten Croatia twice in recent years and the Czech Republic are a good side but are certainly beatable at Hampden
Knowing Scotland we'll fuck it up by managing to lose to Norway in the PO Final
Given that we could have had France and Portugal but instead have Czechia and Croatia, it's not as bad as it could have been
A moot point though, as I don't think we'll get past the winner of the Serbia/Norway playoff to even qualify
If we qualify (and it's a massive IF) we're getting pumped rotten in that group
2nd play off is gonna be tough
They never actually flipped a coin
Wembley was decided because of a) revenue reasons and b) England had qualified automatically
If that happens we qualify automatically
But don't get any home games
Please help
Yes
Scotland's politics are too far removed from England's, and we're being pulled along into Tory governments that we don't vote for time and again
Now, we're being pulled out of the EU without our consent
Independence is the only option
We had a referendum in 2014 and 45% voted for Scottish independence
I would hazard a guess that this number has not dropped in five years, especially considering what has happened with the Conservative governments, Brexit and Boris being PM
Bluntly, I’m too tired with it all
I would still vote Yes but I genuinely cannot be fucked with another 2/3 years of constant campaigning, debates, arguments
Let Brexit happen, give it a decade or so and go from there
This is the final stage in the unravelling of the once-mighty British Empire
We never really completed the transition, institutionally and psychologically, from global imperial power to normal European country
Brexit is, above all, an expression of the older generation's bewilderment at the relative decline in British power and prestige (as well as relative living standards) over their lifetimes
There's a lot of anger, fear and confusion behind it
This is all being deliberately manipulated by a small but very powerful clique of oligarchic libertarians who see it as an opportunity to finally dismantle what's left of the welfare state, workers' rights and environmental protections
The people who are pushing Brexit from the top and the people who are supporting it from the bottom have fundamentally different interests; when the people at the bottom realise how much they've been played, and that nineteenth century British greatness is not coming back - but nineteenth century slums and sweatshops are - there will be hell to pay
In the process of all this, the British 'unwritten constitution' (ok, parts of it are written down, but it is not codified into a supreme and fundamental law of the sort that every other European country has) has shown its weakness
It really offers no protection against a government determined to push its boundaries and exploit its many quirks and loopholes
We've had policy differences for a long time - that's a normal part of democratic politics - but for the first time since the British Civil Wars we now have fundamental disagreements about the legitimacy of the decision-making rules themselves
This is not just a political, economic and diplomatic crisis - leaving Britain weaker, poorer and more isolated than ever before - it is also a profound constitutional crisis
Discourse has also been poisoned
The tension between Leavers and Remainers has reached the point is no longer than of fellow-citizens having a civil disagreement over alternative conceptions of the public good, but a stand-off between enemies
Judges have been attacked as 'enemies of the people'. MPs have been assassinated and threatened
All the things Britain was famous for - civility, common sense, moderation, pragmatism - have fallen apart
Scotland voted in 2014 to stay in the UK
Promises were made at the time: that we would remain in the EU, and that Scotland would have greater autonomy within the UK
Both promises have been broken
The Brexit process has been accompanied by the ignoring and sidelining of the Scottish Government and Scottish Parliament
When Scotland voted by a clear majority in 2016 to remain in the EU, but is being taken out against its will, and against the terms promised in 2014, this is no longer a 'partnership of equals'. It feels increasingly like being a captive country tied to a UK that has lost its mind
Scottish independence is now a necessary and I think inevitable outcome
The only question is whether we get out before the damage is done or afterwards
A small country like Scotland always has to ally itself and share powers with others
In the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, we chose to do that through the framework of the British empire; in the 21st, our only hope is the European Union
I cannot speak about Northern Ireland - it has its own, distinct issues with which I am not well acquainted
But it would not surprise me if we also see a United Ireland at the end of this
Which leaves England and Wales
And I'm not so sure about Wales
I fear for England
I think they (I'm speaking here as a Scot) will see a sort of English Francoism - a nationalist, authoritarian, conservative regime; after that, perhaps, there will be less hubris, the ghosts of empire will be laid to rest, and England can finally become a normal European country too
But that involves at least a generation of pain and misery
> I believe the UK is much stronger together
What does this *mean*? Like, I don't get what the point of such a statement is, how it impacts upon our economies or societies or every day life
This may seem overly harsh, but I'm trying to be genuine here, it just sounds like vacuous politician speak
What does it mean to you
People from other parts of the UK already need to pay fees to study in Scottish universities
I don't see that changing
Yeah proper raging tbh
Its cause of the unionists who would have normally voted lab/ld voting con because they're the strongest party
Very unlikely that Johnson will accept it, and after the last referendum, Sturgeon will only call it if she's sure she'll win
I'd give it some time, perhaps until a labour government gains power in Westminster
You are certainly correct
We were told time after time that leaving the UK meant leaving the EU
The only way to stay in the EU was to vote No
So we did
Two years later Scotland voted to stay in Europe
And the rest of the UK took us out
You cannot write this
Yes me too
It was 45% yes last time
I cannot see that figure getting lower over time
I do think that if and when we get another vote independence will happen
Yeah, when the GERS/GERW figures came out there were a number of posts along those lines
Yes
A lot of Scottish trade is with England - but much of it simply appears that way because it goes through England on its way to the EU
An independent Scotland in the EU would need bigger port facilities to import and export directly to the rest of the EU, bypassing England
So does everyone in the UK except England and Wales
I think it's plenty of people in Europe (at least on Reddit) are as sick of Westminster's pish as the Scots and Irish
They're ready for it all to blow up in their arrogant faces and for them to have to suffer the consequences of the whole "bully bully, rule Britannia" attitude
Are we gonna get into a Macedonian-type argument about what countries can call themselves
haha
Not really
I just weighed up the pros and cons and decided that it was better for the UK/Scotland to be in than out
She's already played the only other woman PM we've had (Thatcher)
Advocating staying in an abusive relationship is horrific
For you, maybe, but not for others, including some people in this thread
Never said they weren't. There will have been many Scots with that attitude in the past
But that's not a part of Scottish identity any more
You'll rarely here Scots harking back for the "good old days of empire". To be fair most English people won't either
Who I'm talking about are those people, especially those in Westminster, who still bang on the empire drum and just expect the world to fall into line
They want to see these people fail, for everything to crumble to ash in their hands
Force them to eat a bit of humble pie
It is an individual thing
It's a fine analogy
You say Wales is buggered because of the actions of Westminster, and yet, you say that it's for that reason they must stay
That's characteristically abusive relationship stuff
I'm confused as to your response here
We're talking about some people in England advocating for getting rid of Scotland and/or Wales as financial burdens
Your response is a non sequitur
If it hasn't shown any interest in doing anything constructive in the past 500 years, what's the likelihood of them doing anything constructive in the next 500
It's like the abusive partner saying "oh, but I'll change"
Spoiler: they won't.
> ...except the UK is a democracy
Mate, an unelected PM just got our elected Parliament closed down by writing a letter to our unelected Queen
He's also denied my country a vote on independence
Not the most democratic credential
> If Plaid Cymru gets more votes, Wales will receive more investment from Westminster
This is completely without foundation
The broken FPTP system will ensure the Tories or Labour will do nothing to work with smaller parties, it's not in their interests
> Scotland's been getting nicer treatment since SNP took power
This is a joke, right
How is that being treated better
And who paid for it
Which government's budget did it come from
I just want you to answer the question I asked
You seem to be suggesting that we should be grateful for being allowed to live in a democracy, and for spending our own money on it
Same in Scotland
Like it's part of your personality that you drink and if you don't you're pushed to have one or there's something wrong
Our binge culture is terrible
Grannys are the worst for this
Throw emotional blackmail in while you are at it
That's what my wee town was like growing up, a proper community
The only choice typically offered in Scottish kebab places is how spicy the sauce is, if memory serves
Kebabs are almost exclusively eaten by very drunk people, so it doesn't really matter what is in them, as it will inevitably be vomited onto the pavement later
I've never even heard of putting onions on kebabs wtf
I mean, I don't know about you guys but that's how I get free kebabs
Hahaha
Absolutely the same here
Edit: like my English brother/sister below, boss is super common too
I'm disappointed at the lack of clapping from strangers in the vicinity
Edinburgh was one of the first major cities built in Scotland (in Northumbria at the time)
Its location has always been perfect for trade with other kingdoms and states
It was also the home of most Scottish literature and innovation from the 1500s onwards
Haggis hunting is actually not legal
>politician Carl I. Hagen wanted us to sell the rights to drill for oil to the Americans
Imagine how different everything would be
Rubs hands in Caledonian bitterness
Although it was Westminster that misspent the oil money, not the US
Though if you only include European Netherlands, your highest point is shared with Germany and Belgium
Tell us a joke then
They broadcast that for the first time in the UK this past hogmanay
Or every person has one ancestor who licked the flavouring off a Tayto twenty generations back
It's one of my favourite countries
I've been there several times and I've read quite a lot about its history, politics and society
I have several Maltese friends and get quite a lot of articles about Malta cropping up in my Facebook and Twitter feeds
I occasionally think about moving there, and probably would if the University of Malta ever gave me a job (which they won't, because as far as I can tell everything is determined by political patronage and you can only be a professor in Malta if you are connected to one of the two big parties)
Stayed there for a few months, it was really lovely
So much history which I find really interesting, they are super into Christmas, there doesn't seem to be any kind of countryside to speak of and I think the only 'wildlife' I saw were lizards, I couldn't pronounce basically anything Maltese but most people spoke English though I did feel a little guilty about it
I would definitely love to go back if I get the chance

Aren't almost all phones on a USB type C cable now
I thought even the recent iPhone had switched to it
Weren't they all mostly used micro USB before type C, excluding iPhones
Am I missing something
ITT: people forget Apple already have done what this law is wanting them to do with the new iPhone charger plugs
Also everyone has collectively forgot about wireless charging and how there’s literally no reason an iPhone wireless charger shouldn’t work on another phone and vice versa
Edit: changed “can and should work” to “shouldn’t”.
And on Brexit no less
Gonna miss this
Gosh, I sure am glad that those wacky European lawmakers won't have any affect on me from now on
^/s
Apple lawyers: "Hold my amicus brief"
Yeah, they’ll get super nervous if everyone figures out they developed time travel technology
Cause, ya know, the new iPhone charger plugs already use USB C.
Well, enjoy your universal phone chargers while we still have to deal with this bullshit

These items were taken from an Ottoman military fort
There is a dispute as to the legality of their removal, Elgin claims he had the authority but there is no independent verification
That he could move items from an Ottoman military fort does suggest he had permission, but then again no corroborating document has been found to his translation
The translation is disputed but hey, that history
Whether he should have or not is another area under dispute
At the time caring about ancient antiquities was something of an obsession of a few eccentric nobles in Europe
There is little evidence people of the time cared, other than one statue that was mistaken for a Christian saint
There is a very good argument the removal disfigured the integrity of the structure and its historical value
There is a weaker, but real argument that moving them to a country that cared for such artefacts reduced the risk they would be damaged as the ruling Ottomans had little interest in archaeology
The modern ideas of preservation of field work and buildings in archaeology are anachronistic, that is out of time when considered
Personally I am open minded on the issue
There are strongish cases on both sides
What this was not about was British imperialism
Also there is a "risk" of president being set, of demands for items to be returned to far more unstable regimes, we have seen recent destruction of ancient artefacts across many countries
Any discussion not acknowledging that this is not a clear case and that the return could have impacts beyond these artefacts themselves is playing for emotive responses rather than a reasoning and thoughtful approach to the complexities
Its also worth noting the Pericles filched money supposedly paid by the Delian League for ships to commission statues and buildings
Its a kind of irony their creation was an act of shall we say, dubious acquisition
This does not change the morality of their current location, just a subtle irony to my mind
Lol yoink
don't forget about a general dislike for the Swiss being neutral
Eh, I find that to be a flimsy justification
I think the best argument against returning stuff because is worrying about these sorts of artefacts being destroyed in countries like [Egypt] or [Ethiopia]
Greece is a first world country, stable and safe, they should have their marbles back
But Middle-Eastern countries that have Iconoclastic Islamists in them
Not as safe
There is also the Museum Fire in Brazil which happened two years ago
Brazil is one of the world's largest economies, and very peaceful (no terrorism, no revolutions, no civil war, etc
), but even they dropped the ball and lost the whole damn thing because the government didn't pay for better sprinklers
Egypt for example claims the Rosetta Stone
Today Egypt is a country that has a pretty good record of looking after artefacts
But it is a country where militant Islamism has a huge following
It is the home of some of the most noted such as Sayyid Qutb and Ayam al-Zawahiri
In its one quasi free election the Muslim Brotherhood took power
Its politically delicate but we cannot assume that Egypt will remain a country where ancient artefacts are secure
Across the world we have seen militant Islamists destroying incredibly valuable items
This does not say the marbles should remain in Britain, but if the debate is allowed to remain a purely low information, slagging fest then the potential consequences of establishing a legal precedent that if you cannot prove you had absolute authority to remove an item it must be returned to the originating country, could fly under the radar
Spain and killing entire civilizations

I am sadly reminded of Lincoln's telling the story of Sykes' dog
*‘Have you ever heard about Sykes’s yellow dog
’ said I to the spokesman of the delegation
He said he hadn’t. ‘Well, I must tell you about him,’ said I. ‘Sykes had a yellow dog he set great store by, but there were a lot of small boys around the village, and that’s always a bad thing for dogs, you know
These boys didn’t share Sykes’s views, and they were not disposed to let the dog have a fair show
Even Sykes had to admit that the dog was getting unpopular; in fact, it was soon seen that a prejudice was growing up against that dog that threatened to wreck all his future prospects in life
The boys, after meditating how they could get the best of him, finally fixed up a cartridge with a long fuse, put the cartridge in a piece of meat, dropped the meat in the road in front of Sykes’s door, and then perched themselves on a fence a good distance off with the end of the fuse in their hands
Then they whistled for the dog
When he came out he scented the bait, and bolted the meat, cartridge and all
The boys touched off the fuse with a cigar, and in about a second a report came from that dog that sounded like a small clap of thunder
Sykes came bouncing out of the house, and yelled: ‘What’s up
Anything busted
’ There was no reply, except a snicker from the small boys roosting on the fence; but as Sykes looked up he saw the whole air filled with pieces of yellow dog
He picked up the biggest piece he could find — a portion of the back, with a part of the tail still hanging to it, and, after turning it around and looking it all over, he said, ‘Well, I guess he’ll never be much account again — as a dog

Not really related to this post but on this sub recently I've seen a lot of islamaphobic comments
I'm not one of those people that think any criticism of Islam is horrible and racist, but people need to remember that most Muslims are just normal people that don't really care about committing religious extremism
I just feel like sometimes people need to remember that radicals of any religion don't make up the majority of the followers

How does one even get a banner than size
How much does it cost
How do you transport it
How do you co-ordinate that many people to hold it
I'm impressed, but genuinely confused
(I'm not asking where they get the money from or how they can afford it
More the practical logistics of getting and deploying a banner that big
I wonder who funded this get together
because they know they'll lose
They sign of bills that parliament passes
Power to appoint the Prime Minister and dismiss them
Power to dismiss Mps
Power to declare war and sue for peace
Command over the armed forces
Although in reality the monarch doesn't actually have these powers
If they just decided to use them then people would be campaigning for the abolishment of the monarchy
If the Queen intervened with Parliament and didn't sign a bill or just declared war or dismissed Mps and the Prime Minister without the most of Parliament agreeing then the Royal family would be Abolished
Their role is just traditional things and they don't really have any power over Parliament
I did not ask where they got the money, but I'd rather take Soro's money than Putin's any day

If TM was given the choice she’d remain in the EU, but as PM she has to do what the country wants
It’s no secret she supported remain so I don’t really get the dig here
For context: Harold Wilson wasn't fond of Europe and whipped his MPs to vote against membership in 73
Yet as PM in 1975 he accepted the result of the ref and kept us in
Going by what some on here say he should have just stuck to his own views and pulled us out
TBH at this point Juncker and Tusk should refuse to meet her, she's not coming in good faith, she just want to run down the clock and they are enabling her

What the Vikings (a discussion about viking being a verb aside) did then isn't so disimilar to what the British empire did in Asia and Africa or Spain in the Americas

Do a Twitter search for "failing EU". They care
Britain is fucked if we leave the EU and it's​ successful without us
If it broke up we'd be no worse off than anyone else
The big issue is Muslim immigrants which I don't think the EU controls
And it's been said that leaving the EU will resolve those issues
No one cared from the opposition to oppose or clarify that though
A lot of leavers did, so our economy wouldn't be relatively much worse off
No, China number one
Austria numbah two
Japan numbah five
Doesn't need to be best, just needs to represent a demographic
Who said "all"? It looks like most, and there is good reason it would be most
It's probably most
Muslim immigrants are coming here cause we used to own that land at some point
Not heard that one before
You really think most Leavers want the EU to succeed
Without us in it
I find that very unlikely
Admittedly I can imagine myself one of them as readily as I can imagine the perspective of a mole or rat
Think about it rationally
People voted Leave for three reasons: to get bilateral trade deals, to kick out foreigners, and to 'take control' of our laws
The free trade people want the EU to fail so we have more trade partners (easily checked by reading what they actually say)
The other two groups shouldn't care but there is overlap between them and the free trade people, and we've already defined them as racist and stupid - so they want the EU to fail for those reasons too
You just needed to think it through
Not just the Uk though
Hmm you've have given me some stuff to look onto now
Have you not been following the debate
All the Daniel Hannan, Douglas Carswell, (ostensibly) Boris Johnson people are arguing for free trade
They want the EU to fail so we have more trading partners
But let's say everyone who voted Leave is more like Farage
Xenophobic little Englanders
Why would they not want the EU to fail
We've defined them as exactly the sort of people who - if they think about foreigners at all - want bad things to happen to them
So all the Leavers we can categorise either want the EU to fail or patriotically don't think about it
Is there a single reason for a Leaver to want the EU to continue
The Leavers you know, your friends the little guys, the average joes - have any of them argued for the success of the EU
Lol yes I was being serious
I was confused, hence why I said you gave me stuff to look into

I imagine the girls were under constant surveillance from their own bodyguards, and from the American government

I don't consider him far right but others would disagree
Jon Harvey was the previous Lord Buckethead, but Todd Durham, creator of the character, disliked him, so he stopped him from being Lord Buckethead and chose someone else to replace Harvey
harvey then became Count Binface, counterpart and adversary to Lord Buckethead III

How is the symbolism idiotic
When I was in France in 2007, a museum guide mentioned that guillotines were illegal to display as a whole - you could either display the blade or the wooden contraption, but not both together
This law seemed to have been repealed by the time I went back in 2015 - I saw a couple in museums
I wonder if this protest symbolism would have been grounds for arrest 10 years ago
I wrote that just after waking up, and forgot to include the guide's explanation that the display was banned because it was considered an instrument of torture
The compromise was that you could display either the blade or the rest of it
EDIT: Two corrections to your post - the "freedom" derived from the French Revolution is debatable
The guillotine was used on the nobility initially, but the Reign of Terror killed far more innocent civilians and religious figures
The internal kerfuffle was only ended when Napoleon came along
His reign was hardly a democracy
And as for "the last lot these had been used on", remember that the guillotine was still being used right up until 1981 for capital punishment
There have been many people killed on them since the 1790s.
I agree that it's a symbol, but the history behind the symbol tends not to be known by those citing it
There was a [Bourbon Restoration] remember
That "open future" didn't really occur until nearly a century later

I think, and this might just be me, that the EU would be (and maybe only a little, it's hard to tell) open for Scotland to quickly rejoin the EU if independent
I dunno though, might be misinterpreting things (for the past 6 years)
should I leave this sub or I should I stay
Just a heads up that this was a stunt carried out by members of the SNP who ran a series of similar ones around Scotland
This wasn't something that was set up by the EU to show solidarity with Scotland, it was a ploy specifically done by the SNP to make it look as if the EU was saying it
Judging by the other comments in this thread I think we can all recognise the difficulties of leaving a union for which we are deeply intertwined with
As tempting as it is to latch on to Scotlands pro EU leanings please do not use it as a means to further the SNP's ill thought out separatist ideals
Thanks lads
It’s better for the Scottish people this way
Our political ideals have been too diverged for too long
And our population is too small to stop Tory governments being voted in
Consider that they only have 6/59 seats in Scotland
As someone from Scotland, I can assure you that the UK won't come to its senses
Scotland has been getting screwed over by Westminster for decades, if not centuries
This Saga is the last straw for us, and splitting from the UK really is by far or best option now
The burden of keeping the UK together cannot possibly fall to us
Sorry
Scotland and England are poles apart politically these days
So much so that it will most definitely lead to the break up of this sham of a union and the us Scots can happily rejoin the EU
Days I look forward to and hope they will arrive sooner rather than later
Was already requested, twice
Yes but Scotland had a clear majority of remain voters
Brexit vote was 52/48 - I'll refer you to how many Tory MPs there are now
The majority of which are, in fact, english MPs
Right, but the UK is a union of nations and on that basis “such and such has more people than x” is completely meaningless
It’s also not a far cry from saying “well but England has vastly more people so it doesn’t really matter how everybody else voted” which is precisely the reason that the union doesn’t work
When comparing countries or regions or cities with one another, there’s a reason we do so on a per capita basis
> Worth remembering that there are millions more English remainers than Scottish ones
Which is irrelevant
A minority of Scots voted leave and not one single constituency had a majority in favour of it
Not
One
There might me more remain voters in England but there is a *majority* of leave voters
The English wanted to leave, The Scots did not
That is the difference
> division and separatism inside the UK
Certainly isn't being caused by the EU
The EU would have about 15% of powers in Scotland if we were independent
Currently the UK holds 80% of powers in Scotland
It's really not comparable
That's just one reason
> Scexit, scottixit, skagxit
Sounds like a drug overdose whatever word you use
Scoot
No they wouldn’t allow it if we had an illegal referendum if it was legal they said they wouldn’t mind
The problems in splitting up are fairly obvious:
* Scotland does trade more with the rUK than anyone else
That matters when it comes to deciding whether to rejoin the EU - that it has trade with the rUK while part of the EEA would suggest that this is its optimal trading partner
* Scotland does have more public spending than it pays for with the tax revenue it raises - to the extent abolishing the military wouldn't get the gap to a sustainable level
Hard choices would need to be made which frankly aren't a part of the current independence campaign
* Scotland has a relatively bad demographic profile - meaning pressure for increased health and pensions spending will go up while the tax base shrinks
This is a challenge for the UK as a whole, but it's worse for us specifically
None of these are particularly short term problems or things which can be easily addressed
If we were to leave the UK we probably wouldn't even re-join the EU; EFTA would make the most sense
Dealing with the other problems also probably requires actions which most of the public wouldn't be happy about - the independence campaign doesn't exactly talk up the solutions to those problems because it knows they're not going to be popular
Agreed in 2014 we gave them one more chance (don't know why we did as I was for Yes) and the first thing that they did was to draw up EVEL, throw The Smith Comission at us and give us paltry powers
2016 was the straw that broke the camels back, watching every region of Scotland vote Remain whilst England voted Leave and decided the entire result of the referendum was what set the UK down this road
The UK has wrote its own demise with Brexit
We're using Scoot
If Labour hadn’t let Scotland down during the Independence referendum they wouldn’t be in this mess
They took for us for granted
And if they had an effective leader who could make decisions and take a stance
Well no other nation has had a EU referendum in recent years
Never mind one based on lies
There is huge differences between Brexit and Scottish independence though
Brexit is isolationist, backwards and exclusionary
Independence is the opposite of that
Brexit could have been easy and slow and manageable but Boris and his chums knew the best way to get power was to rile up the xenophobia
Anyway
The real problems I have is with the democratic systems in the country
It's incompatible with how I, and pretty much everyone I know, think a country should be run
We also vote differently from England
The political landscape in Scotland is so vastly different
We really need a way to create our own path
To make our own mistakes and our own success
Brexit pulled this into sharp focus for a lot of people
We are not the same country as England and should be ruled by them no more
> Pro-EU Scots like to bang on about how 'Scotland would have a veto' within the EU', completely ignorant of the fact that the EU has been slowly but surely eroding the areas over which the veto can be exercised
And if Scotland ever felt that erosion had gone too far then it would have the right to leave
Right now the Scottish Government can win election after election on a platform of independence and the UK Government can simply say "no, you're staying".

Lack of Congress and Senate term limits isn't a bad thing imo

In Canada the appointed Senators actually hold their office until the mandatory retirement age of 75
Are you aware of what a constitutional monarchy entails
The USA, despite its flaws (of which there are many), is remarkably stable and resilient
Their political system gets a lot of shit, for good reason, but it has managed to survive for 200+ years virtually unchanged
In comparison, France (the other republic) is on its fifth republic
One could even say the USA's problems stem from it being too stable and the political status quo being so strongly entrenched that major reform is difficult to accomplish
Germany became the democracy it is today because they literally got bombed to dust and had a "blank slate" to rewrite their whole government system
It is a bit bizarre how frequently the Americans are able to look at a problem that's been solved elsewhere and then just come up with some totally insane solution that definitely won't do what it's supposed to
It's not totally unique to them by any means of course - it might be that they're just louder about their weirdness

The arguing against the UK isn't arguing against the concept of a union generally, I don't know why so many people don't get this, just because you consider leaving a shitty job doesn't mean you must then be unemployed for life rather than simply looking for a better one
>Would Scots get out of a union after so much blabla just to get in to another one

Just a point of order: he does believe in climate change, IIRC he had to build a wall to protect his Irish golf course (citing climate change as a reason)
What I believe he and the Republicans believe is that the measures taken now would be more harmful than doing nothing and waiting for technology to develop to reverse the damage after it has been done
Yeah, on twitter
His *actions* with his business prove otherwise
He's a liar sure, but a businessman

Mosley was at this point a pan-European nationalist

"The idea came to fruition at the Conference of Venice in 1962 when the leaders of the Union Movement, the Deutsche Reichspartei, the Italian Social Movement, Jeune Europe and the Mouvement d'Action Civique came together to form this group
The European Declaration at Venice was released on 1 March 1962 and contained the following ten aims:
The creation of Europe a Nation through a common European government
The creation of an elected European parliament
The continuation of national parliaments with their authority limited to social and cultural matters
Economics to be driven by the wage-price mechanism to ensure fair wages and economic growth
The creation of an economic alternative to capitalism and communism
More worker control and less bureaucracy in nationalized industries
The withdrawal of American and Soviet forces from Europe
An end to the role of the United Nations with the US, USSR and Europe acting as three equals
Decolonization with a move to set up single-ethnic governments in former colonies
Europe to be defined as mainland territory outside of the USSR, the United Kingdom, overseas territories and around one-third of Africa

The first thing that strikes me about this programme is that many of the subscribers of /r/europe would agree with it
So would many enthusiasts for the European Union in general
The position is "Neither Washington nor Moscow" and a third way economically
Where they might disagree is with point 5, preferring liberal capitalism of some kind, point 7, being broadly America-friendly and Russia-phobic, point 9, which hardly applies now, and point 10 especially the bit about Europe including one-third of Africa

What sanctimonious hypocritical nonsense
Why don't they have a day to remember the victims of capitalism and imperialism
What about the mountains of corpses they've produced with their mealy-mouthed "democracy" (read: capitalism), worse in its way than communism or fascism because more insidious
Lmao way to totally ignore the history of WW2 to fit the Western narrative that the commies and Nazis are just as evil
Do you know that the USSR tried to get the liberal Western European states on board with an anti-fascist invasion of Germany well before WW2
When that failed, they really had no choice but to sign a non aggression pact - 20 million Soviets died in the Nazi invasion, what do you think would've happened without those extra 2 years to prepare
Appeasement is seen as a great failure by this country - it's why Chamberlain's reputation is so poor
There's a push online to equivocate the Nazis with the Western Allies driven by a combination of the alt-right and useful idiots on the far left
Molotov-Ribbentrop is seen as worse both because the Soviets used it for their own massive land grabs (how did invading Finland contain Germany again
), because of what they did in the occupied territories, and because the Soviets provided Germany with oil as it was fighting the Allies
> Can't you just have a day to hate the worst regimes that have been created
I hate them 365 days
> They outweigh the deaths of what capitalism has done
Never
Capitalism is creating new bodies every day, at least the commies and Nazis have been stopped
Both world wars, all the wars of imperialism, all the Cold War wars, all the preventable poverty deaths, all the deaths of despair, all the Climate Change deaths to come
Worse because more insidious
> It's like a person advertising a funeral of someone at another person's funeral
The funeral of Nazism was in 1945, and the funeral of communism was in 1989
The funeral of capitalism
when
If it were primarily about containing socialism then they could have avoided war over Poland as well
This is why most believe Chamberlain was appeasing to re-arm rather than to bait war with the Soviets (which wasn't going to break out when they didn't even border Germany)
The equivocation of the Soviets and Nazis is a problem, and mostly comes from Eastern Bloc countries except Russia
Unfortunately a lot of the pushback comes from Western Europeans and Americans standing up for Stalin rather than making a sober assessment
I'd agree that many in the West hoped that the Soviets and Nazis would destroy each other
A similar hope existed in Moscow - that the war in the West would drag out like World War I. The Germans were much more paranoid and assumed the communists and the West were secretly working with each other
In the modern era these three factions all believe something closer to what Germany thought - that the other two sides were working together the whole time

I’m as bleeding heart liberal as they come but it simply boggles my mind that anyone would uproot their lives to move somewhere they do not want to live, that is incompatible with their fundamental values and way of life
Or alternatively, if they are not first generation, and feel their beliefs are more inline with where their parents or grandparents immigrated from, seek to emigrate there to be around more like minded individuals
That is surely a more pleasant existence
Nobody who feels “at home” goes around harbouring so much hate and resentment for their fellow countrymen going about their peaceful days
I will not move to Saudi Arabia as I do not want to live in a country with no alcohol, the death penetration for being gay, and lesser rights for women

I think you (the French) have one big asset on your side: the Republic
It took a century after the French Revolution to finally settle down, but you have a broad consensus on the importance of certain democratic, constitutional, laic values
You can articulate the 'values of the Republic' in a clear, coherent way
You can draw a line between what is and is not acceptable
It's much harder for other countries, who haven't got those foundations, to do so
The point is to always emphasise that the values you are defending are the values of the Republic: they are democratic, constitutional, laic values
That should at least provide a degree of common ground across most of the political spectrum

UK: Fine
I'll just play on my own then

This makes me fucking sad
Round the back
I thought the Fritzls were Austrian
I want to be *here* right now
I watched an Arte video about Sarajevo and have been so interested in visiting ever since
Looks wonderful
Current greece is more like the series going bankrupt because everyone pirated it
This photo is not Madrid there is not enough snow sorry
They look like hoover extensions / nozzles
Not even a "here be dragons"?
Well, this is thoroughly depressing
HOLY SHIT
THEY HAVE TESCO IN SLOVAKIA
Huh, Slovakia has Tesco
Holy fuck
Well lads, we did it
We fucked up and spread thos disease even more than a country with a population of over a billion
You'd have to be a moron believe the numbers china is putting out
How realistic for a country with a populace so large that the confirmed cases would flat line

Damn I though scotland was bad
I live in scotland and here we never see the sun
Not because of that, it's just constantly cloudy
Although 3 oclock sunsets aren't unheard of lmao
Better than the road outside my house in Scotland
>much worse roads in the uk for example
I can confirm, roads are terrible here
But having driven in both countries, I'd 100% take driving in the UK
Every trip from Bucharest to Brasov I see one accident
Ludicrous junctions, level crossings and undertaking lanes - then there's the drivers
The reason the roads are great in Romania
Only 50% of journeys are completed without a fatality
Post downvote edit:
I'm making a joke that the quality of the roads is high due to low usage, because half of all journeys do not reach their destination due to the high number of fatal road accidents
I want this to be a webcomic now
I really love old photos like this, and I love the fashions of the ladies back in the day
The only thing that makes me sad is realising that every single person in those photographs is dead
These are amazing, I hope someone from r/ColorizedHistory will pick them up
Wish I had the skills to do a Scottish version
Haha great
Never realised it was such a similar shape and size
How come you never see Italy and Italia in the same room
I can MILDLY understand all except czechia, as far as I know they haven't had any recent conflict with each other

Do folk on this subreddit not support Catalonia
I mean the politicians got imprisoned for Golding a referendum
How's the situation over there now
Haven't heard much since your politicians were imprisoned or something
I suppose, just think that folk would at least be against the way it was handled
What's the next stage to try get independence
Do the majority want it
Country roooooooads
Same over here in La Paz, Bolivia
But it's summer
Over in Vienna, though, I hear it's warming up this week
My girlfriend is getting annoyed that the bloody weather cannot make up its fucking mind
Well, in La Paz, winter can go to as low as -4C and as high as 10C, summer can go as low as 1C and as high as 20C (I think they got up to a scalding 24C this year)
Rainy season is from sometime in October to around April
It's more homogenous in the lower areas
You know when your friend shows you something they think is funny but you think is just, meh

German Precision
Not nearly as bad as it was with Obama when Angela Merkel likened the NSA to the Stasi after it was revealed they had been spying on her personal mobile phone
She wasn't alone in this during the obama administration so although Trump was laughable, it can still work out badly
&#x200B;
> We want a permanent seat on the UN security council
That's not even up to the USA to decide
You'd have 4 other members to discuss that with, and even then, it's more likely that India (which is a nuclear power) would be the preferred new candidate
> Now most of us have realised the ugly face of US imperialism
Rather pathetic that it took Trump for that to happen
Obama fucks up Syria, 1 million Syrians flood Europe, and he still manages to have over 50%+ positive approval ratings in Germany because
he's cool or something
Trump has actually avoided creating any *new* conflicts in the ME (thereby already fucking up the EU less than Obama indirectly did), but he is reviled and compared to Hitler because he says dumb things on twitter
> binding agreements and treaties not just a "trust me bro
That's what the US Senate is supposed to be for
For whatever reason, American Presidents have decided to ignore that lately (e.g. Obama touting the Iran deal as if it was a sealed affair, even though the Senate told him they did not agree to it)
There’s a medieval knight called Giles d’Argentan that I really like

/r/France is 90% "Air France" memes, to boot
It's a fun sub
/r/Canada, on the other hand, is a dumpster fire

A big part of how good or bad these blocks look is definitely the scenary around them
I'd happily live there to be surrounded by all that greenery
Wtf are these comments
Why are people annoyed that other people are protesting BLM/police brutality rather than Hong Kong
It's ironic that some people are annoyed about what people are choosing to protest about
China oppressing Hong Kong is a Hong Kong issue
Racism is a worldwide issue
It's not hard to see why one issue draws in more people than the other
Besides, a lot of European countries are more racist than the USA
The BLM protests are needed in Europe as much as they are in the USA, if not more so
It was a thing by the FDP
I think they did it for publicity
I remember a lot of police brutality in Barcelona a few years ago, just off the top of my head
And I'm sure that's not the only instance of police brutality in European history
Wtaf
Good
Is this for tourists or will it include business travellers and those on shopping trips\\work ina different country etc

Lucky fellows
I wonder - is everyone there bilingual
How does the dude in the bottom left have a tan
I’m genuinely in awe of the European personnel I’ve worked with in the U.K. who effortlessly flip between 2, 3 or more languages
We were in Split last summer and went to an outdoor restaurant with long tables & benches so everyone piled in wherever there was a spare seat
Just immediately next to us were multiple nationalities but the common language between us and staff was English - that’s a huge reason why Brits are so bad about learning other languages
What in the actual fuck did I just read
They aren’t protesting against terrorism, they are gathering for the victim
Mass gatherings during a global pandemic
Yay

Making her class part of thr national curriculum is the only thing I can think of
So will we see PolWexit
Yup it's a tide ad
I didn't mean from the EU, i mean from Poland itself similar to Scotland (which shows the same divisions on an electoral map)
> I'm simply pissed that Poland will go full right wing populism for the next couple of years
Damn, you're an optimist
These fascists regimes don't tend to be a couple of years and they don't tend to let their reign end electorally
Just look at Hungary where there's pretty much no electoral way back from fascism now
I love that it says (Metropolitan only)
As if adding the rest would make a difference
TIL France is a real country
Yes but if it wasn't metropolitan only it would still be 1:1
There’s a great wee brewpub on the other side which is a cracking way to spend an afternoon
Good beer in general in Newcastle to be fair
As an Eyemouth native (5 minutes north of Berwick) sadly the only real idiosyncrasy of any note is the fact that Berwick Rangers play in the Scottish football league (or whatever it’s called), and not England where they are located
Assert dominance and put a polish flag down over them
Can you also upload the picture from immediately afterwards of them all floating in the pool
You saw this at 7am
So they have been there for two hours
*cries in Scottish
I mentioned Scotland in another post awhile ago and got meet with such hostility
Do you guys hate us now
Càite a bheil Alba
I see how it is
Ahem, Scotland
Do white next
mods talking pish
This seems quite extreme
Isn't it a legitimate question rather than brigading
We've just been patched by all of Europe here D:
They are most definitely a country
It’s just very easy to forget them cause they are in a union of nations
But I have a feeling we won’t have to wait long to see them as an independent nation again
Edit: Scotland is a country
One of the oldest countries
Your country will play them at football, rugby, etc
They have their own parliament
They have their own legal system separate from England
A distinct culture, language and dialects
I could go on but you get the jist
Any denying of Scotland being its own country is just nonsensical pettiness from unionist or those who aren’t too aware of Scotland’s unique situation and long history as a large country (by European standards)
Scotland is a country
I appreciate the input from the people of Southern Ireland
Scotland is a country
Fuck you and your meetballs, I bet your personality is flat packed mate it’s so shite
Has a flag ever more epically crashed and burned compared to what it was trying to achieve
lol
Celtic & Rangers pubs worldwide are defacto embassies
So you think Scotland is a province of the UK no different to Essex
I shouldn't reply to trolls like you but we have a border, a parliament, our own language, our own education system
We were independent for 1000 years before this union
We are a nation thank you very much
> not administrative divisions called "countries" for some reason
The reason being that they're countries in a union
I didn't say it was a sovereign state
I said it was more than a fucking local authority
Its a nation not a region
No i don't care too much on the map I care about people saying my country is the same as a region of a nation
Its rude
Scotland is a country
Feel free to also call those countries then
Yes and I was addressing their comment about Scotland being no different to a Swiss Canton
No, country means country
Post says countries
Scotland is a country, always has been
The UK is coming to an end, happy days
It's really not what people voted for as it was 55% against brexit in Northern Ireland
You mean thats not an accurate drawing of BlowJob
I can get on board with this
I'm aware, I can laugh at it though
You forgot the
UK "you need us more than we need you"
I have a feeling that this is going to be the negotiations from both sides for a while
Both as shown in the gif and the reverse with the UK telling the EU to fuck off
I don't think I've actually seen any demands from the UK in the news, just stuff about the ECJ, Money owed etc
just kill me, this was such a stupid decision
The best would probably be UK(excluding NI) as GB excludes all the islands of the UK and the crown dependencies
If you actually look at the comments, it's the other way around ;)
You're thinking of Little Britain
30 degrees *average* over the whole summer would but not individual days
There are plenty of places the temperature varies 30 degrees
Americans couldn't draw the map in the first place if they tried to make one
I like the Cantonese version of this expression which translates to
"**It's all chicken's intestines to me**"
'*It's All Klatchian* to Me
I say “it’s like trying to read hieroglyphs”
In the UK people also say "double dutch" meaning pretty much the same thing
We need list of all MEPs who voted in favour, with contact details
Also you need to commit to never vote for anyone on said list ever again in any election
Selling out should result in career suicide
Can we check how our mep voted yet
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahahah
another good reason to leave the EU
Yay
I’ve been thoroughly enjoying Mullvad for about 6 months now
Flat €5 a month, zero personal information required (you can send them cash in an envelope along with your randomly generated user code if you really want to stay anonymous), super simple desktop application, good mobile support, good lineup of servers and locations to choose from
Who says we are getting a deal at this point
Might as well blindfold yourself and throw darts in the general direction of a board with the options on it to see if you can randomly hit one in order to make a guess at where things might end up
I didn't even see it at first and very unlikely I would have seen it irl
Fun fact that I discovered around 6 years ago getting caught in a winter storm in north america, -40C is the same as -40F. I still don't understand F, but there it is
But is your solar power or Wind power working
/jokes
All it's points of interest are wrong, from body temperature to the freezing point of sea water
It's worthless as far as I can tell
And then we did it again 2 decades later
Humans suck
The Taiping Rebellion might genuinely rival WW1 as the "second worst war ever" (number of deaths), and it all started because a Chinese student had a mental breakdown and proclaimed himself the brother of Jesus Christ
This is not a joke or exaggeration
An estimated 20-30 million Chinese people died because of this lunatic
Just wait until you hear about that time when 20-30 million people in China died because some failed student thought he was the younger brother of Jesus Christ
No, this is not a joke, this shit actually happened
Read more about the Eastern Front, China and the Asian Theatre
Finally, one I can answer
At one point, many years ago, I had just sold my house and made a nice profit
I was in the middle of a career break and looking for new directions
I also happened to be visiting Poland at the time
I looked into buying a business there - a small supermarket or coffee shop - but decided that the risk of Russian invasion leading to the Partition of Poland and the capture of my assets by Putin was too great
And that's why I didn't invest in Eastern Poland
You are in NATO now
So you are completely safe, so long as the US doesn't elect a President who is an isolationist supported by the Kremlin
Oh, wait
This colourisation is amazing
I can't decide whether to hate or love it
Depends on the fairy tale
Like the one where the girl marries a king, he goes off to war, the kings mum tries to kill her and the kids then cuts her hands of and drives them out into the woods so she sells them to the devil because they are starving
The devil gives her a pair of silver hands so she can look after herself
Then hubbie gets blinded and ends up wandering in the woods too
EDIT I could see Koschei the Deathless living there
He didn't have to have the referendum - I can't quite figure out if it was hubris or vanity that finally convinced him to do it but it was definitely a deadly sin
I agree there is a special circle of hell reserved for Gove and Johnson, but I also see austerity economics as the primary cause for the disillusionment with Westminster
The 2011 riots were a warning ignored - deprivation and penury over prolonged periods leads to extremism, something that had been clearly established after WW2
this is Tusks take on it after talking to Cameron prior to the 2015 election
>Mr Tusk said: “I asked David Cameron ‘Why did you decide on this referendum, this – it’s so dangerous, so even stupid, you know
’. And, he told me – and I was really amazed and even shocked – that the only reason was his own party
>Mr Tusk continued: “[He told me] he felt really safe, because he thought at the same time that there’s no risk of a referendum, because his coalition partner, the Liberals, would block this idea of a referendum
But then, surprisingly, he won and there was no coalition partner
So paradoxically David Cameron became the real victim of his own victory
I agree with your points but would add the banking crisis was squarely caused by the previous labour administration under Brown not saying no to pressure from the banks to lax controls , but primarily, it was caused by the greed of the banks
And seeing the costs being passed to the public along with those of corporate tax evasion, to then continue to adopt austerity measures essentially punishing people for the excesses of business and trying to hide it behind a demonisation of the poor
Those were ideological vanity choices made by Cameron and Clegg, and perpetuated by Cameron
Do the Finnish Police ever need to use skiis, maybe not for cities but I can see that being quite  important
Why are organisations doing this
It just seems like a waste of time and public money
Because it’s a nice car
Good thing is we can all still be close allies even if we are not in a political union
Except we voted to NO
/r/Europe loves to pretend that the UK voted to Remain and Scotland voted Yes
What you want isnt reality
Europe - Scotland is gonna need your support to get away from its abusive partner
I'm not sure what you mean I'm Scottish and most people here are pro EU
Yeah it’s a stupid mentality for anyone to have
Just for leaving a trade block
Brits would not have the same view if someone else had left instead of us
Better get the hammers and saws, we need to move the parliament of Great Britain out of London
How high is it compared to nations like italiy France Poland and hungry which are also euro septic
Hopefully once we've left everything can normalise quickly
This is true, I don't get why people don't understand this
Do you ever see any American or Chinese products in the UK
Exactly, you don't. We're not in a union with them so we cannot physically do any trade with them
Right now Scotland can trade with the EU and UK
If it leaves both, there won't be anyone to trade with, they'll need to completely fend for themselves
I went to Iceland last month, and they're not in the EU, nor the UK
Guess what it is like there
Yep, there's nothing
Cars don't even exist there yet
I would say the big difference here though, is this is our second spike, which was predicted to be worse than the first
The US however never dealt with their first spike like we did and are seeing constant spikes and the graph even shows
Most likely we will spike and then dip similar to the first one, the US on the other hand will dip slightly and then grow further because they aren't dealing with it
God fucking damnit
As a remainer, THE PEOPLE VOTED FOR BREXIT, TRYING TO STOP THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS MAKES YOU LOOK LIKE A FIRST CLASS MORON
He sure is making a difference
That’s pretty sad

Not for long
Yeah the redcaps/bots seem to have trigger words, Sweden is definitely one of them
I always thought complaining about the weather was only a British past time
As time goes on, and the more people I speak to from across the world, the more I realise that everyone likes to complain about the weather
Hot, cold, wet, dry, windy or snowy, people love to complain
And it’s absolutely glorious
It’s the go-to small talk when things get awkward
Wow, the Dutch and the British are the same people
This video could easily be about British people and their relationship with the weather
I honestly can't process this fully
Hell, just the travelling photographic Holocaust Museum exhibit made me bawl
I couldn't handle a concentration  camp visit
Is that the church that Corvus Glaive smacked Vision about on the roof of in Avengers: Infinity War
What do you mean
Heavy use of sandstone which tends to darken upon exposure to soot from smoke due to the structure of the stone, partially from industry but also because coal fires were just how buildings were heated
The nickname for Edinburgh is "Auld Reekie" (Scots for "Old Smoky")
Some buildings have been cleaned but the techniques are damaging so are used sparingly
There is also the issue of "should the buildings be cleaned
". When restoring a building, how do you choose what era to restore it to
If its raining the stone becomes darker
Yes it was caused by the pollution
The buildings are made of sandstone which is a lot lighter in colour
Nah, that was St Giles Cathedral, which is a bit further down the road
The church there is actually no longer a church - it’s called The Hub and is an event space
Edin Burg, Scatland

Yeah I get you, I agree

You have to be hard of thinking to read the fucking nonsense they print

You might think it's dumb, but imagine what would have happened if Le Pen had won the first round, and then presumably lost today
It would have meant your system wasn't stupid
If you had a simple FPTP system then Le Pen might have won the first round
This way all the reasonable parties can unite against her
Good job April 1st
I, for one, welcome our new American overlords
Yep this could be Scotland

Ohh you don’t want to see Russian roads
As a Scot, we get a ton of rain and I think I have seen that more times than anything
You clearly haven’t been on a backroad or just a road in general
Some of the roads are worse in the Scottish highlands
Thats fucked

This hurts to look at, at least the EU contributions would turn into productive projects the UK would benefit from, this is just burning money
We can also cut out the middle man and invest in ourselves
Yeah, because we were totally being ruled by Brusseld and had absolutely no control over our country already
If tomorrows world truly is that of empires we'll be assimilated into one regardless
It doesn't matter anyway as he is one single person, one single MEP for Belgium and as such it's extremely dishonest to take his own views and use them to vilify the EU as a whole and represent them as very widespread across EU nations
Then the EU can leave a corner of the sign, but take the rest
Maybe the 'fun-' part can stay
That 5th in the world is going to be for long
Once we leave our favourable position that'll drop
Anyway, you're talking like we'd have a choice if the world of tomorrow becomes one of empires
We're a small island and the world is already very different from the one where the British Empire once reigned
It's all irrelevant anyway you're still taking a single quote from one single person (it doesn't matter if he is "the EU's top negotiator" as you put it) and using it to vilify and misrepresent an entire union of countries which is ncredibly dishonest
Nice job to Austria, Croatia, and Latvia, the surprise leaders
It's interesting how sudden and rapid our change here in the UK is
Sometimes I really hate that I live in the UK
A shame that Cyprus can’t look at what you are doing
My point was a comment to a post about Denmark (which has one of the highest percentages of renewables) vs Cyprus which looks like it has the lowest
Of course *all* countries need to shift their blend of power generation towards more renewables
Examination of the charts shows that most counties are making active progress
Sadly the Cyprus graphic also looks like little progress is being made
It’s a lovely country - famous for its good weather but having the same 2020 7% target as Germany seems like setting the bar too low
Malta has a population density of 1354 people per km2 on an area of 320 km2
Cyprus has 130 per km2 on an area of 9240 km2
So they aren’t as comparable as you say
Given its geographical location and dependence on imported fuels I would have thought this be a higher priority for Cyprus
It’s not just me thinking this:
Edit - word
There are EfW projects around the world digging up old landfills and treating them like mines
We now have pretty good waste separation technology which can pull out recyclables (ferrous/non-ferrous metals etc) leaving putrescible materials as feedstock for anaerobic digestion and easily combusted materials to supply gasification/combustion processes
Sadly, in the U.K. at least, so many of the projects I know of have struggled with various issues: bad design, overly ambitious budgets, poor engineering & dodgy installation, etc
Hopefully we get through this teething period sooner, rather than later
Source - work in EfW
I am aware of the costs involved
That’s why you appoint an EPC to take the risk and provide the energy
Yes
That’s exactly it
Plus the geopolitical security risk of being dependant on importing in what is a fairly unstable area
And EfW can make money while minimising loss of land through tipping
Why are they carrying him battering ram style though and not stretcher
That's not how diplomats work
Belarus is not part or even aligned with the EU so expelling missions from Belarus but not Saudi Arabia, China, Egypt, ect
would be extremely biased
Severing ties with dictatorships tends to result in them doubling down and wielding it as propaganda, not suddenly deciding to respect the will of the people
Further sanctions are a different matter, though
The UK continuing to be the USA of Europe
Well we have Greggs if you and it you’d understand
Always kinda annoys me when graphs and maps show UK as one entity, like Scotland, Ireland, Wales and England are all so massively different culturally, it's only the government that is overarching and even then each country has its own government anyway
But doing % of UK is basically the same thing as just doing % of England cause of the massive population discrepancy
Uk is chonky

I'm just thinking what it says about these buildings, we know the kinds of buildings supermarkets and fast food places opt to build, looking at the opulence of these buildings, there's no chance these companies would pay to maintain them in good condition, it pretty much represents a temporary occupation while these places decline, that to me is a great shame
Everyone is blaming the internet but nobody seems to mention there is large groups of immigrants to Europe that I think would be less likely to believe in the holocaust

"Too many corpses strew the paths of individualism and collectivism
Under two apparently contradictory rationalities has raged an identical gangsterism, an identical oppression of the isolated man

As a Brit, I definitely didn't like the look of that figure, but I felt a lot better when I saw the USA number
It's correct though our government is a mess, we're in desperate need of some French Revolution style shit and the current party in power should not be trusted one bit
How odd
I used to work for Apple in Scotland when the plastic carrier bag charge (5 pence) was introduced
They decided that we would keep giving out bags for free and just pay the fines
Really pissed me off because the point of that charge was to reduce plastic bag waste, not just a charge for the sake of it
Only spent a couple of hours in Darmstadt but it was definitely a lovely town
Happy Independence Україна! I visited Kyiv in 2018
Beautiful city and one I would recommend to all
I hope you can sort out your politics and corruption blighting your country
TIL I'm older than Ukraine
....spoiler: good luck with your knees in a few years
Slava Ukrayini
You appear to have insulted everyone except Sweden for some reason
Northern Ireland will be happy with this
I'll nEw NoRtHeRn IrElAnD ye ya fuckin wee cunt
So, um, what's going on with Switzerland
If you wanted to really offend the Scots you should have said northern England not very northern Ireland
Tips for the British isles
1: keep Ireland unified but call it England
2: call Scotland northern England
3: delete Wales
4: call England “Small America”
I dunno I feel like we got it pretty light tbh
It’s like half it’s normal size fs
Quite a few people out and about at 4:50 a.m lol

Same here

She is English not Scottish
I agree with everything but she doesnae sound very Scottish tae me
Are you sure she is Scottish
Cause that ain't an accent I've ever heard up here
Not to be pernickity but she's clearly no Scottish
Well said though
So Scottish alliance with basically everyone in Europe then
Sounds good to me
As I said somewhere else, your nationality isn't defined by your accent
There are plenty of people that are from or living in a country but don't have the accent
In fact, there are people who have nationality for countries they don't live in
As far as I'm aware, she *isn't* from Scotland, but her accent alone isn't proof of that
Fun fact: That street directly in the middle of the photo that goes up to the left is called ‘Cockburn Street’.
Can you guess how it’s pronounced
[Google streetview location]
When I see St Giles I always think of Jenny Geddes throwing that stool
I live in Dundee, an hour's train away
My friends all say I'm crazy for never having been to Edinburgh, I really have to sometime
You’re welcome guys
That's Cockburn Street - the castle isn't in shot
Was visiting earlier to see a friend
50 for a pint of Tennent’s
That’s a hard pass from me

That roof is where Vision fought the Black Order in Infinity War
To add to what the other Edinburgher has already said, Edinburgh is generally a remarkably compact city
There’s nowhere in particular more than a 30 minute walk away
Weird seeing Trainspotting get downvoted :/
Edinburgh, Scotland, United Kingdom
Scotland is still a country
Watching that film and living here was a bit surreal
The fuck are the Avengers doing in Waverly station
Where's all the drunk folk pouring out of Hive
It’s free

Yeah same
I lived there for 6 years

True fact: Tolkien based his high elven language on Finnish
If he had ever been out in Oulu on a Friday night I'm sure he would have given it to the Orcs
Also the Orcs would have fought with a kebab in one hand

Dont tell Spain
Europe has got to let go of this idiocy about flags
Flag-wavers are always the worst people
Is Europe giving us the 'fuck me' eyes
Yaaaaas mon the Scotland
[We have a habit of harmlessly vandalising public property
You can help Scotland to fuck off even faster by donating [here]
Spain has been saying since 2017 that they wouldn't veto Scotland joining the EU as an Independent country, why the fuck are people still spreading this bullshit myth
BINGO
Mention oil as well and I'll be on to a winner
Moldova smells weird
Nothing wrong with being patriotic about your flag
Like I don't have a saltire on my roof or anything, but it's still nice to see that Scotlands welcome in Europe
Literally never heard anyone so much as mention romania
Poles, on the other hand
Aye you away and dae that hen
It doesn't make any difference
It goes by the passport and not the flag
Most of the time they can't even tell the difference between an Englishman and a Scotsman on the continent
We’ve been told we can and most people are in favour of it
Just cuz you don’t think we can doesn’t mean we can’t
South Africa
I'm well aware of what it said in the article, no Public figure that is for Independence is seriously advocating UDI
If I hadn't read it I wouldn't have posted it
Touché.
Why are you twisting my words like that
Literally no need to be so hostile
It's not all about politics and nationality though, it's about EU states showing solidarity and support for Scotland through all this Brexit crap
I think it extends beyond that to Romanians = street beggars, because there are so many people in the UK who have been trafficked over (from Romania or elsewhere I don't know, although it's said they're Roma) and people say they're only pretending to be homeless so they can make money for dodgy gangs in Eastern Europe
>Wouldnt the uk just send its military in then
To do what
If there was a serious majority for independence then sending in the military would have no impact beyond a few weeks and create huge social unrest
The mechanics of setting up a taxation system and paying for a bureaucracy would make a "UDI" an economic disaster
In reality London would just drive a very hard bargain in negotiating while Scotland struggled with currency issues
You cannot raise sovereign debt if you are not sovereign
A thing like this does not make any difference
Solidarity and support are just words with nothing behind them
And a flag is a piece of coloured cloth
Nothing happens when you hang up a piece of coloured cloth in a street
Yes but things change, Alex Salmond is no longer an SNP MP, hell he's not even an SNP member
The SNP stated in their 2016 that if there was grounds to hold a referendum they would seek to hold one
Those Grounds are Brexit, Brexit has changed everything
Even the The Tories agree with the polls being in favour of Scottish Independence it can no longer be denied
We don't hate English people
As a nation we definitively voted against Brexit but are now out of the EU against our will
On top of that, one of the biggest arguments the pro union campaign used against independence was that by voting no, we would be guaranteeing our eu membership
The conservative government that's in charge of the UK is widely hated in Scotland and England only seems to be getting more conservative, meaning we will be left with a government we in no way voted for
I just think politically England and Scotland are going in two very different directions and it doesn't make sense for us to be dragged along with them
Ah yes 58% for independence in the last poll but apparently ‘not in our lifetime’ as if the union will last
We're not karens either, I see why some people get frustrated
Every day from the English it's either "you're never getting independence" but also "looool can't wait for them to leave they're nothing ng but a drain on GLORIOUS ENGLAND" but also simultaneously "nooo don't go we r stronger together "
There's nothing in the 2012 Edinburgh Agreement on which The 2014 Independence Referendum wasn't about "Once in a Generation",it wasn't even on the Agreement
Jeremy Corbyn said that the 2019 Election was "Once in a generation chance for change". When Alex Salmond was talking about "Once in a Generation" that's pretty much the same point
What Alex Salmond said was "The Referendum is a Once in a Generation Opportunity".
Mate I couldnt give a rat's arse, I'd just rather not have a racist lying prick in charge of my country thanks
In The EU referendum Scotland voted overwhelmingly to remain
Yes I can blame the English, as my point is how inconsistent their message is
Oh no, I'm not allowed to be racist at the dinner table anymore, the travesty
You're giving me a right laugh tonight mate cant lie, I'll make sure you're the first to know when I'm in the gulag
"brexit will be great for buisness" fuck off
Massive German car manufacturing industry and a wealth of crucial experience which Tesla really need
I mean yeah that doesn't explain Berlin specifically but maybe they believe they will be attracting people to the capital or something
Building cars
They've had pretty well publicised problems in refining the process of building cars to a cost, ongoing quality issues etc
They're improving but they are a new player to an industry where they will benefit from people more experienced in mass production
Name might be a clue
I hope Portugal's sounds better translated, that's such a clumsy line for a saying
What do Icelanders say
Is that a cat on the window sill, or a giant cat terrorising the city centre in the distance
I stayed in the Hotel Atlanta, above the Irish pub called St James Gate in Rembrandtplein the first time I went to Amsterdam
The hotel was a shithole and the heating didn't work (made especially worse as it was during the "beast from the east" and at one point it was -9 degrees) but the Irish pub was decent and did a good pint of Guinness
Rembrandtplein was lovely in itself as well
> I feel like in Dublin any time anything is put forward that slightly inconveniences drivers there's an uproar in both the city council and the population
Same in Glasgow
I'd love to see George Square pedestrianised, but I know for a fact that all the drivers would be up in arms because "how am I supposed to get to the other side of George Square
Christ don't even get me started
You even remotely suggest pedestrianising any single part of Glasgow City Centre and all of a sudden you've got a million car drivers screeching "HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO GET MY SHOPPING HOME
" or "WE'LL JUST GO TO THE FORGE INSTEAD"
I wonder what the fourth era will look like
Looks like a big of an evil building thing

Does this mean I have to leave this sub on the 31st
at least we'll still be neighbours :)
See yous soon when we're getting the Celtic Craic Union on the go
Here's hoping
Not all that much difference
We stay in the single market through the transition period, which includes freedom of movement
If you do come to the UK this year, you can apply for [pre-settled status online] for no cost
This allows you to stay in the UK on effectively the same basis as you can now
At the end of the transition period, which ends at midnight on 31 December 2020
Irish Border Boogaloo is just a reboot of 'The Troubles' I hear

That's such a sweet story :)

No it's fine, I find family histories interesting :)
Its The Crown really just a classy rewrite of the past 60 years of UK tabloid headlines
The 80's was when Koch started cracking down hard on minor offences like littering and avoiding subway fares, arguably a sign of the modern American carceral state
You wouldn't have seen litter like this
What the fuck Germany
I had my fill of Diana media bullshit when I was a bloody toddler, I cannot imagine *willingly* consuming more of it
You'd be surprised at how some of the older east coast cities in the US retain some level of English esque architecture
[I find it a damn shame that places like Boston are the exception] rather than the norm, for the USA
Italy and Spain were also often used as replacements for Texas and Arizona in spaghetti Western films
Bloody shame too, I don't think any royal family in Europe could top the Habsburgs in
eccentricities
> It's like they're so scared that if any of their protagonists are racists (which they probably would be given that time period)
Lmao we don't even have to guess, Prince Philip has no filter on whatsoever
He's the entire nation's racist uncle
I’d rather be in the US sphere of influence
Jesus christ his roof, suspension, hood
damn, that poor car
thats probably not good for the suspension
What
Even today Rotterdam is well regarded for its modern architecture
For such a heavily bombed city Rotterdam was able to redefine itself and remake its identity
Go to Dresden if you want a bad example of modernism
Unless you're suggesting every example of modernism is worthless
>Rotterdam was punitive and destroyed for no other reason than to make the Netherlands submit
There was no tactical reason
Are you arguing for or against the both sides are equally bad rhetoric
The area bombings of Germany were also ordered to make them submit, but instead of one large city it was every large city
Why is the both sides equally bad rhetoric so bad
Should we just ignore holding anyone of team A accountable to war crimes because team B's supporters are racist
The following is a comically evil, somehow real quote of Arthur Harris who believed that somehow killing as many civilians as possible would make Germany surrender
He said this in response to official statements that the bombings were only targeting industrial and economic targets with the civilian casualties or property damage being unintentional
>The aim of the Combined Bomber Offensive [...] should be unambiguously stated [as] the destruction of German cities, the killing of German workers, and the disruption of civilised life throughout Germany [...] the destruction of houses, public utilities, transport and lives, the creation of a refugee problem on an unprecedented scale, and the breakdown of morale both at home and at the battle fronts by fear of extended and intensified bombing, are accepted and intended aims of our bombing policy
They are not by-products of attempts to hit factories
I mean Antonio Costa's, P.S party has done an incredible job
He has managed to reverse a lot of damaging austerity while systematically improving the economy and public finances
Here is a good article and interview by world politics review
If you are interested in Portuguese politics have a quick look at the result of their elections on October 6th as it should be very interesting
Portugal has really made an incredible economic recovery
If you want to have a Google there are lots of other interesting stories about Portuguese politics
I hope they all said their favourite Christmas movie is Rare Exports

God as a Scot seeing us greyed off the map is an absolute gut punch
I was looking for the UK in the list, couldn't see it, looked at the map and it was greyed out
I'm proud to be Scottish, but not proud to be british anymore
For info - here's the RSF reasoning for this ranking:
Honestly
That's suprisingly better than I expected
Smart move
Which country is it that Germans can get into the others can't?
As a Scottish person this makes me so very very sad
I saw them really high on a list of anti-vax countries the other day
They might be Hungary but they’re not thirsty

FIXED
Oh my goodness
Glaswegian here - this makes me homesick
Can't wait to travel back again
It used to be the entrance to the Subway, the architecture matched the hotel that used to stand nearby
The hotel has since been replaced with a modern shopping centre
The Subway station is still there, but it has a new [glass entrance] now
It’s the old subway station that’s been converted
There's a photo from back in the 70s/80s where this building is suspended in the air while the subway was being renovated underneath and around it, it looks mental, like how did those pylons support the entire weight of that building
[edit:[found it
Fun fact, it used to be the entrance to the St Enoch subway station before becoming disused and then renovated into the Cafe Nero you see now
I just moved here and I go past that coffee shop everyday
it's so surreal to see it on reddit with thousands of upvotes lol
If I remember correctly, it's the old ticket office for the underground at St Enoch
The ticket office us now underground and the coffee shop has the building now
I've been in there
It's very nice
Love Glasgow, Scotland
Walked past it many times, but never been in
Tbf though I'd imagine it's much the same as any other Cafe Nero on the inside, so probably best to just admire it from the outside
FYI the armadillo pattern you can see in the doorway is actually a reflection of the St Enoch subway entrance behind the photographer
I just moved here from up north and I never want to leave, it's such a lovely city
right there with you, been living in Dundee for years now and it's just not the same
YOU CAN'T HANDLE MY POTIONS, TRAVELLER
Same
Well it's a lot more functional, there's actually 2 of them, one on either side of the station
You couldn't really filter modern commuter crowds through that old building which is why they changed it up
But yeah, not the most timeless architecture is it
ah what are the chances
came up for uni myself, still not thought of an escape plan yet
Better than the utilitarian orange and brown brick buildings that they replaced
They were very much of their time (late 70's/early 80's)
I did too, then I ended up staying
Dundee's no Glasgow, but it's got everything you need and there are a lot of similarities (both got majority 'Yes' in indyref for example
All in all I'm happy here, but I used to go back home at least fortnightly (I really miss my family just now)
I hope you enjoy yourself here too
yeah took me ages to actually start exploring but there's some nice spots like the law & balgay park (even if I like to joke otherwise) and aye another Yes city is nice too
same here about missing family, Dundee's nice but it'll never be home without that
The UK doesn't deserve presents
This whole thing has been the biggest pile of stupidity and lies since the Daily Mail added a comments section

They do seem to love coal for some reason
Sorry for our country, merry Christmas all :L
They don't credit it there either
It's by David Schneider (on Twitter)
We ffffffucked it
As a British person, I see European hostility to current UK policies as sympathy with British people
Isn't brown coal still popular because the green lobby was able to force the planned phase out of German nuclear plants after Fukushima

No, it isn't.

Call me when the Dutch start building islands just off the coast of Norfolk to try and enforce non existent territorial claims on the North Sea
I left home at 16, almost 17
It was pretty much a disaster and I ended up moving back home within 2 years, which wasn't well-received and resulted in a lot of conflict and tension
With hindsight, I see it as a terrible indictment of my family situation, given that I actually *wanted* to leave home at such a young age, and my mother not only stood back and watched it happen, but actually went along with it
I think the fact I expressed an interest in moving out should have caused alarm bells to ring, but my mother just naively assumed I would be fine, when in fact I was very immature and tremendously unprepared for adult life
Looking back, I can see how poorly it went affected my entire life, undermining my confidence and damaging my educational, social and career prospects
I had a lot of disadvantages to overcome growing up, and feeling the need to essentially flee the family home only made a bad situation worse IMO
Having said that the situation at home was really unbearable for me, so perhaps I did the best thing I could in the circumstances
i'm gonna miss being a part of infographics after brexit

They aren't - they offer less protection from things like barbed wire and blistering gas
It's also said that the shiny sporrans in WWI reflected a lot of light - making the wearer easier to see and giving the Germans a nice central target to aim for

He never said to deny anything
It would be more like Germany saying "yes the Holocaust happened but it was a state that no longer exists that was responsible". But even then, Hitler was elected on his platform of anti-Semitism and the German people knew more about the Holocaust than they let on
The ones who committed the Armenian genocide weren't appointed by the people at all, so there's a stronger case for separating the modern state from the empire
I would argue that, personally
Mussolini already tried making that true and it didn't work out
Jokes aside the Roman empire went on with zero Italian territory for a thousand years after the fall of Rome so I think it's silly to suggest Italy is its successor
In a presidential system yes
In a parliamentary system no
The presidential system is too open to abuse
They can lose the support of the legislature and still retain vast powers
A chancellor/prime minister that loses support is out on his/her ear
can’t argue with that
Can't complain

As I had to point out the last time this was posted, the wikipedia list this map was made from is unsourced and inaccurate
As others have said Glasgow and Edinburgh were not in any way founded by the Romans
Being Scottish those are the ones I'm aware are wrong, I'm sure many more are
Without sources to back it up this map is generally useless
The list is incomplete as well, so the "every" is also untrue
It's very sad to see false information being posted and believed yet again
In a lot of those cases I wouldn't say founded, rather that their introduction of infrastructure made the existing small towns/villages flourish
They built a lot of stuff here (UK) for a country they didn't even manage to hold on to
Also Prideful reminder that they never took scotland
Glasgow and Edinburgh weren't founded by the Romans
Also missing tons of other cities
pretty shit map
Even the Romans didn't want Dundee
But didn't America Guy come first
What an utter wankstain you are
Personally, I've been at university, so I have no ability to move despite wanting to
Hopefully Scotland gets another referendum
Scotland has free university for it's own students from Scotland, and for people from the EU
It's just the other parts of the UK that have to pay to go
Scotland voted to stay in the EU as a majority, and as a whole we tend to like the EU
I'm unsure of what the Scottish governments plans are post Brexit though, but I assume they're going to try to get another independence referendum to be able to return to the EU
And hello to the customary hordes of drunken British people
Those poor people
Haven't they suffered enough
This does not look like somewhere that it’d be safe to walk after a few refreshments

I always head up Cockburn street when I'm going from the train station to pretty much anywhere on the south side
There's something nicely bracing about a steep hill climb after you get off the train
RIP Whiplash Trash though ;;
And it is a true representation of summer in Scotland - all cloud and no rain
Still think Glasgow should be capital
A bit like Kraków
Little in the sense it's younger perhaps, but by far the bigger city
>by far
It's only 100,000 more
Geographical size
The city limits of Glasgow are a bit less defined and can end up including much more people than Edinburgh
UK kinda letting the side down
To be fair, Oregon is one of the least affected states from the virus right
Bottom 5 I'm sure
I don't think the same precautions are being taken in a lot of other states
I don't have the EU as a whole, but I've got the USA and some European countries tracked in a table [here]
The USA isn't doing that bad at all compared to most of the large European countries, at least when it comes to deaths
But it will be best to look at the excess death figures when they're available
The FT has some excess death figures [available] and again things don't seem too bad in the USA, at least compared to the likes of the UK, Spain, and Italy
Although the data there is from a range of dates
But yeah, comparing infections and tests isn't particularly useful
Deaths are the best way, and excess deaths are definitely the best possible metric
Edit* I've also made this, which shows weekly increases in the above countries
I'm not sure if the USA has being testing more and more, but it is still quite shocking how their number of infections are hardly decreasing
Gotta conquer someone to have an empire

How are you sending wishes from two places

No problem, just peculiar
I guess it's down to how you like to identify yourself
I'm personally always a bit unsure about how to identify myself
Apple doesn't have the Scottish flag
I can't find it on android either
I guess I am Scottish since I've lived here the longest, more than 10 years
However I was born in the USA, lived in Canada and England, and to top it off my family is from Bulgaria like yourself
(I actually just came back from Sofia
) So even though I've lived in Scotland the longest I don't really identify as Scottish
at least not yet

What does that have to do with what he wrote
He wasn't making any statement about anything, just summarising the people in this thread
My mum, born in 1952, told me that she had no idea that homosexuality existed growing up
According to her, it was simply not talked about in the fifties and sixties, in the media or anywhere else, or if if was she missed it
She only realized the existence of homosexuality in 1969 when she was in London and hanging about with the hippies in Trafalgar Square (or was it Picadilly Circus) and noticed some young men who were entering and exiting the public toilets there strangely frequently
Why were these men frequenting the public toilets so much, she wondered
Why does France not surprise me
The legalisation of homosexuality takes the fun out of it for me tbh
Not in Scotland and Northern Ireland
Oh Italy
When I saw that originally, I thought it was a funny photoshop
But apparently not
In Germany you need a special permit to have fun and the quota for 2017 was already given away

Last year my mrs was in a private hospital in constanta and it was a very nice place, doctors were useless though
And then she was in the state hospital which was visibly comparable to the older hospital where we live in the UK
And a fridge
you would think
Both the Private and State hospital managed to miss a huge issue that was eventually solved when we made it back to the UK
To be fair though, the local older doctors practise in constanta did seemed to be a lot more on the ball
Apparently the older doctor guys are more in it for helping folk, but younger doctors just want to make money
They were allowed in specifically because France, the United Kingdom, and Germany wanted the expansion
However, all the member nations were against allowing free movement of those nations until significant advances had been made, to prevent mass migration
The UK, though, was desperate for new cheap labour, and spent months convincing the other nations to allow migration from E. European nations
And now it's Britain, my own damn country, protesting about "lazy eastern Europeans coming in and simultaneously being on the dole AND somehow stealing our jobs". Fuck I'm glad I moved to Australia, at least we're upfront about our severe xenophobia
I got a train to a town in Yorkshire where they filmed some Harry Potter and the show heartbeat

During the 2014 campaign Unionist would try and argue that Scotland wouldn’t be welcomed into the EU or we would need to go to the back of an imaginary queue to join
Thinking back to some of the arguments they used is just laughable
They even threatened to put up a guarded border between Scotland and England
Thanks
Hopefully we will be with you guys soon so long as little England doesn't succeed in preventing indyref2
Oh the cunts are still here

> 1 million Scots voted to leave the EU
62% of Scottish voters were Remain
> It'd be nice if we stopped treating this as a black and white thing
62% is a *far* larger margin than that being used to justify 'Brexit'.
Could you explain the inconsistency
Isnt the combined population of NI, Scotland and Wales around 10m?
62% voted to remain I would say it’s more pro eu
I like people like you, people like you and what you say and do are the reason Scotland will leave the UK
Continue doing gods work my dude
It’ll be interesting to see how women’s magazines go from telling women how to be anorexic to how to put on enough weight to not get malnourished and die

It's about 50/50, which was confirmed by the election results last week
If anyone tells you which way the election will go they are clearly not very well informed
Any of the arguments there were against Brexit are even more acute against Scottish independence
Scotland going it alone and hoping to rejoin the EU doesn’t present any reasonable prospect of economical benefits over staying in the UK
Most independence supporters argue (much like Brexiteers) that the economic pain would be worth it for more sovereignty
>I wouldn't be remotely surprised to find out in a few years that Sturgeon and Putin are connected
Absolute nonsense and insane that it's being upvoted
Cringe scene
England never colonised Scotland
I mean
yeah, because it's civic nationalism not blood and soil nationalism
It has more or less the same problems but worse, and largely relies on the same arguments and same reasoning - which sort of gives the sense that what's being said doesn't really matter
Though on /r/Europe it is less supported than on the American-dominated subreddits since a connection isn't made to the Trump psychodrama
A similar example is Quebec
They had two referendums with similar results in both and it seems to have put the issue to bed
It has returned and levelled out at its post brexit but pre pandemic levels
Right
In case you missed it salmond and Sturgeon hate each other now
All the smart Scots go to England already, this will just be the exodus x100
Korpiklaani rewrote [Beer Beer] in most of these languages
I know in Ireland they don't like the term "British Isles" as it suggests that the island of Ireland is "British" in a national not just in a geographic sense, but imagine being lumped in with England all the time, as though you don't matter or don't exist, in the everyday speech of Americans and continentals alike
Imagine the chagrin
This diagram has some big mistakes
The island of Ireland is not considered part of the British Isles by people from there
The Channel Islands are not 'British Islands'. They are part of the historical region of Normandy, now in France
Not all of Scotland, Wales and England are on Great Britain
Scotland has more than 700 outlying islands
I just meant in terms of nomenclature, I wasn't referring to the union
They are part of the historical region of Normandy
Obviously they are not part of the modern French department

Kinda surprised this was stopped though given moving goods into North Korea should be as simple as stating China to be the final destination and then simply moving them on quietly from there
The Chinese Government aren't exactly coy about their support for North Korea, it's pretty much accepted that most goods entering the country are via the Chinese border but there isn't a whole lot anyone can do about that
Just the right amount for a good Friday night
Officially
Keeping the dictatorship sweet has been a Chinese policy for a long time and they've let through whatever is necessary to keep that fat bastard content and calm him down when necessary
I think he knows his country is relatively safe because a buffer zone is required between the USA and China though
Nobody ever seems to have proposed a good solution for that problem, I suppose Trump has in a way though by threatening to take the USA out of South Korea

Support their right to a vote on independence, but I think this could have been handled better by both parties
Catalunya should have pushed for a legal vote (like Scotland), Spain shouldn't have reacted with violence to the vote
A big big mess
Not sure how the EU will handle this
> Obviously this is controversial as topics go

I mean, legally speaking isn't Catalonia in the EU until the Spanish recognise them as Independent anyway
I mean I get the whole out of the EU thing but really, the circumstances under which they are effectively out of the EU only occur once Spain recognises their Independence and that isn't something that appears to be on the horizon and if it ever gets to that stage I have to imagine we'd be in a situation where there was a more collaborative relationship between the two governments
For the time being Catalonia will be treated as any other part of the EU because to the EU nothing has changed and the biggest voice demanding that will be the Spanish
basically what I'm  getting at is, by the time Catalonia actually finds itself becoming Independent and leaving the EU if it ever does, chances are it'll be dealing with a Spain far more amenable to helping it back in
In other words, "Catalonia is on the rag".
Yep, I'd prefer they played it smart, but Scottish independence *supporters* seem to have become kindred spirits with the Catalan independence supporters
They held a refferendum, and people who didn't want to vote boycotted it
Then they held a vote in parliament, and politicians who didn't want to be independent boycotted it
Not sure what else they can do
If every liberal boycotted the next US election, and Trump won with 90% of the votes, what happens there
Does Trump become president, or does nothing happen
Trump would become president because 90% of voters voted for him
That's what would happen
Catalonia is going to become independent because 90% of voters voted for it
That's what democracy is
No, I'm under no illusions about that but people saying Catalonia is leaving the EU as a result of this vote don't seem to get that nobody would dispute that more than Spain itself
Yep, the only real connection is catalonia supporting the yes campaign (one of very few "countries" to do so) in the lead up to indyref
This is some well done satire

She was, but now in many ways she's the most fanatical of the brexiteers
Even Dominic Raab (the second EU exit Secretary to resign) admitted that remaining in the EU would be better than the worst case scenarios now being talked about
For some reason, May won't hear of it
She's determined to Brexit on any terms regardless of the consequences
She got the nickname "the submarine" during the remain campaign as she always disappeared whenever something important happened
Most people that I know think this is because she chose the remain camp as it was politically advantageous, but wasn't overtly campaigning for it as that would harm her standing with leave voters
As such, most of us have no idea what her real position is
Its pretty ironic watching people wearing nike shoes demanding statues of people associated with slavery get taken down

There's two types of Loot Boxes, Loot Boxes are things that you can buy to get extra content in your game and Loot Boxes that you win for free
They'll give things that you could potentially get an edge in the game, for example Call of Duty you could win better weapons via Loot Boxes, the problem with them is the Odds for some items that to get Rare in game content is so low that it can tempt people to pay for them as you do get Loot Boxes at the end of a round that are free but they don't great Loot so it will tempt to try and pay for them
With the rewards always being Random and Paying to Win said Rarer Items can easily be addictive, EA Games tried to call Loot Boxes "Surprise Mechanics" to a Committee in the UK government in 2018 and they were having none of it
There's been many times that kids have ran up crazy bills on their Parents Credit or Debit Card as they no idea what is going on
Older gamers like myself are on to this type thing and we hate Loot Boxes, we want rid of them because they can give an opponent a hidden edge as long as they don't mind paying thousands to get
I'm against it as it you should be able to unlock said content through the game but now that's rare to happen with EA in things like Fifa to the point where it would really tempt to buy some, at first you may think "What can it hurt it's only 9
99 for this box, I'll buy it once or twice and see what happens" the problem is that there's an addictive thrill to players for unlocking content in games so if you're not careful you end up with thousands of debt because of them

Your country as a whole voted to leave
Scotland voted overwhelmingly to remain
I'm not even a Scottish nationalist but Scotland was completely bullshitted in that referendum
Edit: spelling
Lol not with our post-independence deficit
I'm talking about the EU referendum not the independence referendum
If we're going to get technical, then yes the UK is a country but it is a sovereign state
England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are all separate countries
Separate countries with completely different cultures and different social, economic and political views
all being governed under a single political body
England has a population 10 times higher than any of the other countries in the UK
This means when it comes to voting, the UK gets what England wants (9 times out of 10)
I having nothing against England, this is not a matter of being childish, and I voted No in the independence referendum
All I'm saying is that there is a blatant flaw in 4 nations being governed by a single parliament, especially when one of those nations is far bigger than the rest, and that this ancient union was formed to stop us from killing each other hundreds of years ago
This is no longer the case and is it proving to be undemocratic and oppressive
Obviously not every city can have its own parliament and there is a certain degree of tolerance needed, but we're talking about different countries here
Aberdeen is not controlled by the SNP and labour have made gains in Edinburgh
You hit the nail on the head about 'Scotland doesn't get a say
' argument
The UK votes as a whole, all people's votes are equal (Scotland actually has a bit more MPs per capita) yet these people want the Scottish vote to be equal to the English vote
I despise nationalism on all levels, but I would vote for independence if there was indyref2 due to the result of the EU referendum
I am not convinced Scotland has a voice in West Minster
The result of the EU referendum was just so black and white
Edit: wording
I had assumed that the Erdogan vote was highly motivated by peoples religious ideals, those who want greater Islamic presence in turkey vs those who want it to be more secular
There may be joint overlap though, i have no idea on religious density per district
[no need to worry]
why would closing stations make it busier
there may be people going from a closed one to get on at an open one but that will not compensate for the people who are going 2 or 3 stops who choose not to use it now
Considering this is reduced trains and the underground carriages look pretty normal that would mean the stations being closed have reduced the people trying to use the tube
but i didn't ask about less trains
and a lot of people only get on for 2 or 3 stops
They all don't bother now
I'm against the death penalty, but it's times like this that I think we should be allowed to make an exception
As much as I’m left, and as much as I *now* support Scottish independence, I do not take The National as a particularly reliable source of unbiased factual information, much like I don’t do that with Fox News on the other side
The paper was set up during the Scottish Independence debate and has had that agenda ever since
As much as I’m sure I’d agree with much of its stance, because I am generally aligned, I wouldn’t bother reading some biased echo chamber

They want to see the balance on my banking passbook up-to-date so I had to take that into the bank to get it updated too
Now they have decided that the address on my passbook being out-of-date is an issue, so I've emailed the bank to ask about that and they said I'd have to take it back in to get it done
I've replied asking if we can do it by post but will have to see about that
Plus when I was in Glasgow yesterday getting all this done I had to repeatedly ask for directions and speak to bus drivers about my intended journey

I think a lot of people in the UK didn't want to fully leave, but have something like Norway in the EEA
But the EU wouldn't allow it ://
Apologies, I didn't literally mean in the EEA, we were trying to get something similar but with a stricter border
Yes, a lot of the voters were sadly mislead :(
Man really gonna break all the people in Scotland’s heart who pretend we’re Nordic

The US has been our closest ally for decades and we want to remain close with them
I really don’t see the issue here
I hope we do the same with CANZUK after we’ve finally left after abandoning them in the first place
Japan is another example-they are doing okay
>countries dont have "friends"
So why do people paint the EU as a friend
Because some Scots don't feel British, others do
Because I consider myself both
Nah but we don't want to be in a political union

Surely one cannot say that the simple existence of a tall tower is detrimental towards a city
Cities can coexist with great history and modern development, like London, New York, and Tokyo, all great world-class cities
Warsaw doesn't even have that many skyscrapers in the first place, (only 8)
They're all located close to one another in the city centre (which is newer than most European centres due to bombing in WWII), so even if they are bad for Warsaw's cityscape you can go literally anywhere else and enjoy beautiful low-rises
Lastly, they're not even architecturally bad
Much better than the tower blocks they build in China, for example
I'd hardly call seeing a few more towers harming the harmony of a cityscape, which prior to the boom had only the single Soviet-built Palace of Culture and Science
I could explain why you don't have any friends

The world is rapidly becoming a scarier climate to live in
Thoughts are with the dutch today
Look, we already tried that with Ireland 4 centuries ago and it completely backfired
In what way is that not true
Its an opinion, i'm not saying that everyone believes that
Edit: I'm not saying more dangerous, just a scarier political and social climate in my opinion
I am more concerned with the rise of misinformation and radicalisation than anything
We have entered an era of social echo chambers becoming a breeding ground for hatred and unfortunately on occasions violence
Sure on paper we may be living in a safer society but the rise of random attacks based on politics or religion and the way that they are reported on just scares me
I'm just stating how I feel, I respect if you guys think differently
Y'all seem to be forgetting that being scared is an emotion
If the world is becoming scarier to me that doesnt necessarily need to apply to everyone
I dont understand why this has created so much discourse :(

Dam son
This seems so huge that its hard to imagine that its feasible, but I wonder if a barrier across the Strait of Gibraltar will actually end up being built and used to generate insane amounts of electricity
The Persian Gulf and Red Sea are narrow enough to be dammed as well, potentially saving a lot of low-lying ground in the middle-East and southern Europe, though probably at huge environmental cost
Could we please have those dams also function as road & rail bridges
If you put a road on top of the dam, it'd technically be a bridge across the north sea and Boris Johnson would die of a pleasure induced aneurism

We will be again soon ;) keep the heid
Get us to fuck sooner rather than later
It’s kind of complicated
There’s this thing called the “Scotland Act of 1998” which basically states that the Scottish Parliament, Holyrood in Edinburgh, can’t pass any legislation which relates to any “reserved powers” which Westminster holds, including the existence of the Union
The only reason we got to hold one in 2012 was because we signed an agreement with the UK government called “Section 30” which temporarily gave us the power to hold one
We would need to get the UK to agree to another order, otherwise if we went ahead and had one without the UK’s “consent”, the ruling if turned in  favour of independence could be boycotted or blocked in the Supreme Court because it’s not technically legally binding
Sturgeon and the SNP are pushing to have another one before May 2021 but we would essentially need Boris’s consent to do so, and he’s said in interviews that he wouldn’t give his consent
So it’s going to be a tug of war for sure
Hope this makes sense
Sounds like a terminal disease
It’s just nice to feel included really :)
I can see the point, but a lot of people don’t consider themselves British, myself included
“This man is your FRIEND
He fights for FREEDOM
I'm slightly colour blind and was thinking, 'so what's the green
I don't mind religions dying at all, I just hope we keep as much of the positive cultural aspects as possible
A lot of it is nice, as you say
Buildings, music, ceremonies, gatherings, holidays, etc
JÓHANNESSON: MAKE PIZZA GREAT AGAIN
The man talks sense
Good, I'm glad to see a politician having the balls to crack down on that disgusting behaviour
I once had a pizza from a takeaway in south Wales, with small chunks of potato on it
It was quite nice actually
Can I stay
>anchovies on pizza
Are you insane
Haggis is the only acceptable "weird" topping on pizza
Doesn't look like a pine, doesn't look like an apple
>Anchovies isn't weird
Disgusting little fishes; it's weird
>I don't even know what haggis is
It's glorious
Deep Fried burn that right there
I think that's the joke - the vouchers are the same price as the regular menu
Is it
The mini fillet is usually a quid, so I assumed that the rest of the vouchers were nonsense too
Huh, it's a quid in my local one - I wonder if it's regional pricing
Thanks for reminding me to renew my passport early
I want to avoid the embarrassing of carrying around that blue one for as long as possible
I actually do like this colour more - but the fact that it's changing annoys me more than the new colour pleases me
Even more ridiculous was the Brit media going along with this, taking an angry press release from the losing company as the basis for a few days of brexity headlines
Twats
Enjoy your downgrade
Oh yeah, every single one of us voted to stay in the UK, it was pretty much unanimous
What was it, like 98% No and 2% Yes
Yeah, my point is that you can’t just assume that Scotland as a whole voted to stay
Only 55% at the time did, which isn’t really enough of a majority to assume that any Scot you meet wanted to stay in the UK
Yeah, I know why it happened
I live in Scotland, you don’t have to explain it too me
I do agree with what you’re saying though
Granada is the first city I've been to where they have the mist spray to keep people cool outside bars
Really lovely city, I went in August 2018 and I have never sweated so much in all my life
As someone born in raised in Scotland, the introduction of free tuition fees has been instrumental in my life
I'm only 19 right now bit come from a poor background and it's thanks to this that I'm currently in uni and doing pretty well for myself
Without it, I don't think I could have gone
Not necessarily true
Any UK residents (with the exception of Northern Irish students with dual citizenship), regardless of where they're born, are subject to the same residency requirements for free tuition in Scotland
You have to have lived in Scotland for at least 3 continuous years prior to your course start date
Someone born in England, moved to Scotland at 5, and applying for university at 18 will have their tuition covered by the Scottish government
Someone born in Scotland, moved to England at 5, and returning to Scotland at 18 to apply for university will have to pay full tuition fees
This is because England opted out of giving free tuition to EU students, so they lost it in turn for English students going anywhere else
Charge fees for visiting students to your country and your students will be charged equal fees when they go elsewhere
[Can anyone guess why
You will always be welcome here
Please wait for us - we will take that 27th member spot once England leaves
Not really, its a reciprocity thing
No, it's because the rest of the UK is not a separate entity in the EU with respect to Scotland
I need to pay tuition in Scotland because of some silly rules, and was upset about it  but it's only £1700 a year
I couldn't imagine paying £3000 a year never mind £9000
It's the sad Torification of the UK, unfortunately
You'll find people even defending it these days
Maggie's foul offspring have finally cracked them
We love you lads too
We might need some of that automatic French citizenship shortly - any chance
It's because we apply the same 3 year residency requirement for free tuition regardless of where you were born in the UK
Someone who was born in Scotland, moved to England at 5, and returned at 18 to apply for university will have to pay fees
Someone born in England, moved to Scotland at 5, and applying for university at 18 will get free tuition
It's based on a residency requirement, not where you were born, you need 3 continuous years residency in Scotland prior to your course start date
That would absolutely fuck them over
Another blatent dismisal of our devolved parliament
The Tory bastards
Yeah it could
Unfortunately the rest of the UK has succumbed to the right wing personality defect that makes them think it's a smashing idea to charge tuition fees
Until that is sorted out it's not likely they'll do so
St Andrews, Edinburgh and Glasgow are among the best universities in the UK, hence why lots of English people go to them
> We have the best universities though
No denying you have some amazing unis
> And student debt does not act like normal debt
**Everyone in the nation can afford it
That last part simply isn't true when you throw in the cost of living as a student
I'm planning on travelling when I graduate, if you guys can drink I'll be there
English salt tastes best
I don't know what that means but I like you
No, we want to
Still I'd offer it to France before I'd offer it to the rest of the UK
Get some other people over here, it's nice
Hahahahaha this guy had to live in Dundee for four years
They're different constituent countries, but they're both in the sovereign country of the United Kingdom
There's nothing wrong with their comment, you're just misunderstanding it
Well you see, the reason we have it for free at the point of use is because our education is a devolved power meaning our government controls it and not Westminster
As we also tend to vote more left wing than the rest of the UK, we have the Scottish National Party as our government and they introduced it back in 2010
If the rest of the UK wanted free tuition fee (something politicians have promised them since we introduced it back in 2010 during pretty much every election) they would have to do it through the UK parliament
Wait, so you're saying because we have a devolved system that your politicians can't vote in, but you don't cause you have never voted for one (like we did) it's our fault your politicians don't give you free tuition
Whats that got to do with anything
Many people in working class backgrounds
Yes they can go and the loans are easily repayable once employed but the cost of living is too high for many
We represent a smaller percentage of the UK population but contribute a higher percent in tax, so not sure what you're talking about really
A constituent country is not the same thing as a sovereign country
They're saying that both England and Scotland are part of the UK (the same sovereign country), you're assuming that they're saying that both England and Scotland are the same constituent country
You're misunderstanding them
I myself am from a working class background and it is not misleading
Even with a higher maintenance loan and a job that pays me £9 per hour, I struggle to get by and that's at a uni with comparatively low costs
I encourage everyone who wants to persue education to do, I myself have worked hard to get to this point but I would be lying if I said it was affordable and the fact that tuition fees are paid was a huge motivator for me as it meant one less debt
Interesting
I'm guessing the Barnett formula accounts for a comparatively more dispersed and remote population, and the public spending implications that come with this
I'm going to go away and read up on this more though, cheers
> which is an objectively incorrect statement
It's not, because they're both in the UK, which is the same country
It's only incorrect if you wrongly assume they meant constituent country
I  work around 30 hours a week, I don't have a car, I have a strict food budget that I stick to, my rent is fairly reasonable and I have cut out all unnecessary memberships and such
I know I'm not alone in this either
Many of my friends work more hours than me and budget even better and still struggle
I mean I get by but just barely and as some people have suggested here that it's a great time to be saving and stuff, well that's just bs because pretty much most people I have met at uni are only just getting by
> Scotland, England, Wales etc
are referred to as 'countries'
Yes they are referred to as countries, but they're not sovereign countries, which is what the common use of country refers to
My loan just about covers my rent and I don't make over £1000 per month
Sovereign country is the common definition used when someone says country
It's incredibly rare that someone means constituent country when they say country, because it's not a common use
You're assuming they meant constituent, which is incredibly unlikely
I'm getting bored of this now, you're just being a pedant
You clearly understood what they meant and just want an argument
Feel free to shout into the abyss if you want
> Lmao, you're just being awkward now man
I'll just leave this map here
You're the one linking a "UK map" that includes Ireland

Did that building have something to do with the Warsaw Uprising

I was under the impression that totally bombed and was effectively dead compared to Czech Republic
Gotta spend big and do big stuff if that's the desire
As it is ESA and NASA work very well together
NASA are going to be doing big stuff in the nearish future though, ESA will of course be involved in a lot of stuff as well but if public engagement is the desire then we need to be thinking much bigger
Manned flight and ambitious goals are the key imo
We need a Mars programme - we need someone to come out and do a JFK
I'm fairly sure that if you dial 911, 999, or 000 in Europe your numbers will also be routed through
I've been to several airports where I've gotten it for free
As it should be because it's fucking water
Glasgow has a free water fountain
Sure, it pours like a drop a minute but it works and is free
I was thinking we were having a warm month
I guess it just doesn't feel that unusual because it's still cooler than the summer heatwave
It was 19°C here in Edinburgh, and I was coat free and still too hot
I'd think it's similarly coat free there
Yeah, then the Paris Commune happened and the rebels just built bigger barricades
It’s easy to get rid of without paying as well
Haha, amateur hour

It's misleading to suggest that we're imprisoned by Britain, we're not
Scotland has one of the few separatist movements which isn't illegal/suppressed/etc
Had we voted in 2014 to leave the UK then we'd have left
However the basic point is still true, as the government fucks Brexit up more and more the UK may disintegrate internally
Brexit is horrendously damaging
Scotland wants to be an independent country but we also want to join the EU
I personally prefer Caledonia
Me too
I didn't know that
I like it
Someone from NI complaining about Nationalism
LOL
Scotland is barely ‘part’ of Britain it has a small, meaningless voice within the UK parliamentary system and a limited devolved government which can have powers taken away from it on a whim of the UK government going from recent developments around its brexit bill
Very little Scots are proud Brits, if many at all, most no voters done so out of a fear for the future not a misguided sense of pride in an empire which has not been relevant for around 100 years
Yes but in 2014 Scotland was told the only way it could stay in the EU was to stay part of the UK
That probably had an impact on how people voted
And it isn't like Scotland voted to stay in the EU either
But we're apparently all oppressed by our Westmonster overlords
Fair point, but you could always leave if it has that much of an impact
Incorrect, most Scots are Brits by default and have little ‘pride’ in being British
Pride in historical contributions to the empire are of little relevance to independence arguments
Andy Murray actually revealed himself as a supporter for Independence on the day of the referendum
Some nats seem to act like we're oppressed
I have no issue if people want to argue that the union is not ideal the way it is
Everybody I know who wants Scottish independence is sitting and waiting to see what happens with Brexit
Hell, even the SNP are
I didn't mean nat to come across as derogatory
Apologies
> current arrangement isn't idea in achieving the kind of life they want
Agreed
In Britain the minister of health was recorded post curfew time in a bar, actually making jokes about abusing the current Covid-19 government support scheme, and nothing happened
This is how I feel lawmaking should be from time to time
I know endless debate and refinement is a good thing but sometimes a swift enactment like this can restore faith in the ability of government
I think this is great actually because it shows that democracy really works
Doesn't matter what the personal opinions are of the country's leader, if the majority vote for it, it happens
Vive le démocratie
Lang lebe die Demokratie

Kinda surprised the UK is so accepting of Muslims after the history the country has had over the past few years
Unless you're in Slovakia, which exists in a localised time warp where Hitler won the war, apparently
From anecdotal experience being from the UK I would say most people also don't think of Indians and Pakistani as Asian, just refer to them as Indian or Pakistani,
for some reason our media always labels them as Asian in news stories and statistics but there has always been varying amounts of backlash to that as well
ITT people arguing in their shared language about how their cultures are totally different and have been separated for 'thousands of years'. Hint - if you share a language with another country your cultures cannot have diverged more than 400 years ago
When you haven’t had a government in more than a year, you lose the rights to have a full time prime minister, I guess

Just want to add a video of a short livestream Count Dankula did from the European Parliament after the vote
He confirms that all, or as near as make no difference, of the proposed amendments to the bill have been rejected and in amongst the "what the fuck just happened" he raises a pretty interesting point: That these bills (or similar) have already been trialed in Spain and it absolutely ruined small businesses and cause Google News (a free news aggregate service) to pull out of the country entirely for the cheek of charging them to provide a free service - most importantly even after the trial ended Google News has still not returned to the country

Shame on OP for not including it (although a lot of maps data visualization software don't allow you to separate the UK, so I'll give them a pass)
On there it is Scotland 1
12, Northern Ireland 1
22, and England/Wales 1
Sadly not
Most statistics for England/Wales are grouped together by the ONS
Curious what the figures would show in Scotland for the percentage of support for the Euro, instead of looking at the UK as a whole
Scotlands no getting hot days

it's gonna be 26 degrees here on Friday
Why has England stolen the UK flag for itself
Scotland looks far too happy
England’s flag should be  but at least you did the devolved countries so I like it
Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia are in Europe
Their eyes definitely seem a lot more weary than anyone else
Scotland is very different from both of those as we are an actual country
Just very excited to be separate from the UK on a /r/europe map
Whereas Scotland is a COUNTRY
>subdivision of UK
THOSE ARE COUNTRIES
The UK doesn't even have a fucking constitution, that hardly means anything

Fantasy Europe - In a Tolkien sort of style
Hi /r/Europe
Ive been doing a few maps like this lately and thought some of you in the venn diagram of Europeans and map people might like this sort of thing
I've been having fun lately making Tolkien-ish versions of real world locations - last week I had a go at Scotland which you can see over [here] and New England which is [here] They're fun to work on, but sadly not overly accurate
Here's a few more pictures of this Europe map from my blog:

And sorry for the places I missed out and various spelling mistakes
I tried to fix a few of these [here] - Now featuring Prague

I love these but the random hills is just too much for me to swallow
I'd love this as a big print/canvas if it had more cities labelled

In retrospect this was a stupid mistake to make
There we go, Prague goodness:
Sorry about that, I didnt spent much time on research and frankly I dont know mainland Europe that well - didnt mean to offend
Precisely
There we go, Prague goodness:
I agree, I missed Prague by rushing the whole thing - definitely not intentional
Prague is in now
True, could definitely have done things a bit more comprehensively
haha maybe, but they start to look samey after a while, my range is really limited
Was going to but would inevitably upset people who live in supposedly major cities that weren't included
Belfast and Cardiff should be there, and Edinburgh deserves to be there
Prague is in now

It's astounding how rubbish German espionage and intelligence was during the Second World War
They truly had no fucking clue what they were up against
>  I wonder if germany had any chance at all of winning the war in the east,
It really depends on the Soviet's willingness to continue fighting, or not
Even if Germany took Moscow, the Soviets had already evacuated most of the government to the secondary capital in Samara, and they'd keep fighting from there
The USSR was the size of Pluto, so needless to say it was virtually impossible for Germany to subjugate that country as long as that country was willing to keep fighting on
I had been led to believe that Kant never left Königsberg, but today I learned that's a myth

Sandstone is difficult to restore as a lot of the techniques to lift dirt will obliterate detail
When they did the Art Gallery in Glasgow they sprayed the surface with liquid latex and peeled it off once it solidified, taking the dirt off but leaving the stone unharmed
I believe they started this in 2015, the museum was covered in scaffolding last June when I was in Prague and I had a nosey online to see why
Isn't it the case that with less air pollution nowadays, sandstone buildings get dirty a lot slower
Maybe it'll last 6 years
No worries, I'm just gutted that I can't find a picture of it in progress (there are some at the gallery itself and they are pretty cool)

Scotland and the rest of the UK should be separate since we have a different education system, as its a devolved matter

Poland is Roman Catholic
Russia and Latvia are Orthodox Catholic
Sorry but you are incorrect
'Orthodox' is short for 'Orthodox Catholic'. That's the reason that the Roman Catholic church needs to specify 'Roman' in its name - the Catholic Church split into two parts during the Great Schism, and both parts view themselves as the legitimate Catholic Church
Orthodox Catholics are no less Catholic than Roman Catholics

The suez crisis was a military victory by all accounts with the British, French and Israeli coalition achieving all their military objectives

>Mau Mau rebellion
Again, The Mau Mau rebellion was crushed and did not achieve it's goals
Kenyan independence was achieved by different means
You could have found this out by spending 30 seconds on wikipedia
It's literally in the first couple paragraphs of the Mau Mau rebellion article
Kenyan independence was achieved years after the mau mau's dissolved
Here we see the Irish Nationalist emerging from his den
He can sense anything that is remotely positive or even neutral about the UK from over 500 miles away and set out to destroy it
The British achieved exactly what they set out to do but in the end conceded their gains in order to maintain cordial relations with two world superpowers
Perceive that as you will but in my eyes it's a victory
Well, that's just untrue
The UK played a major role in the allied victory
If not for the UK there would have been virtually no Western Front after France was defeated
Even though fighting was heavier on the Eastern Front, fighting on two fronts was highly detrimental to German success
Also, the Normandy Landings could not have went ahead without the UK as a base nor without Britain providing nearly half of the man power
I'm not arguing that the US or the Soviet Union had the largest parts to play in an allied victory, but to say the UK was 'unimportant' is nonsense
It is pretty much true, at least in the sense that I've never had a good tomato north of that line, nor a bad one south of it

This is the special American definition of socialism, which is "the state doing literally anything, except its proper "limited government" roles of giving money to the military so they can build boondoggle helicopters and kill people with drones, and devising tax breaks for the richest

It's really quite petty, if only England would see that the manner in which the EU is dealing with Brexit is the same manner in which England dealt with Scotland

Everything is white and cold looking
It looks like a prison
A true EU partnership
So if you want to travel you've to re-enact Lord of War
Am I reading that right
thank you, you legends
Oh shit, wasn't that the place from Aquaman

Knowing Boris he’ll just smash the jar
Will be interesting
NOW EAT YOUR GLASS JAM, PLEBS
Scotland and Ireland the only two countries entirely tertiary
Great form from the lads
Should point out that Scotland is commonly University and college level education because we don't have tuition fees for Scots here
Mon the Scotland
We are smart as fuck
It's hard to compare these things across countries
Scotland has no vocational high schools so people tend to leave high school a year or two early and go to college for a year if they want a vocational career
You can leave school at 16 in Scotland and be finished college before you turn 18
So tertiary education doesn't actually mean they are any more or better educated than if they went to a vocational high school and left at 18, as I believe happens in Germany for example
Have a look at this mean years of schooling for comparison, it tells quite a different story:
You can be a zoo keeper in Germany by an apprenticeship
Time to learn German
I would only live on a bridge built in 1344, at the absolute minimum
1345 is too recent for me, and I don't like modern architecture
Eh Malta deserves a shoutout
Americans and geographical knowledge
As a protest lets all linedance in front of their HQ
My entire family are Free Presbyterian and I have never heard of anyone wearing a headscarf
It's total bollocks
The Democratic Unionist Party Party
Which is why the government is now preparing for a no deal
> prime-minister has to make sure the interests of the 60mil brits will be looked after
I don't get the feeling that Boris cares that much for the rest of us tbh
> Is like UK created the problem and now is pointing fingers at the EU claiming they refuse to solve said problem in a manner that satisfies UK's interests
I mean, that's pretty much been the Conservative party line ever since the EU became a thing
I get that the dithering is annoying but normal people are gonna get fucked up because of political games
> but I dont think you match their population minimum to join the EU yourselves, so you still wouldn't be able to
Out of the current member states Ireland, Croatia, Lithuania, Slovenia, Latvia, Estonia, Cyprus, Luxembourg and Malta all have smaller populations than Scotland, with Malta being the smallest at 475, 701 (according to their last official estimate in 2016)
So I think we'll be fine in that regard
Here's the link to email MEPs in your area
There's also an option to call and tweet
If you can find another way to make a difference let people know
I'm offended
that Yorkshire puddings are on the "bad" side of the deal
This level of insult should not be tolerated in a modern society
Holy fuck, Scotland gets their own flag on this sub
The fact this exists just made me sub holy crap
Aussie cartoon apparently
Pass the gravy I'm going in
A national dish/food is hardly a local delicacy
I'm sure that the court requires you to implement the European Convention on Human Rights and the tories are committed to dismantling that and replacing it with something that "better reflects British values".
Woo, wales hype
Thanks Balls
We appreciate it :)
Well it's more like four folk and two of them were quite happy to stay but were getting dragged out anyway
Most countries 1st level of administration also have theor own flag so the French and Spanish regions etc
Yeah but it was the nasty Labour ones that wrote it
Can't have the proles telling blue bloods what rights they have, they need to learn their place
^/s ^obviously
Woo, French and Spanish regions hype
It's also why they always refrigerate them across the pond
It's not the pathogens in American food you have to worry about, it's the ingredients
They have very little obligation to be healthy, and as a result the food available to working class people barely resembles what Europeans would consider food
Malnourished chubby kids everywhere
Britain can look forward to this
The eggs are washed because they can be have excrement on them
Because there is no need to vaccinate chickens in the US, this (along with the actual egg itself) can contain salmonella and can therefore lead to contamination of other foods
The eggs must therefore be washed and refrigerated
In the EU, there are requirements around vaccination of chickens, so salmonella infecting eggs is unusual
I remember seeing a Ukrainian tank with the slogan "Happy Holidays" sprayed across the front, for all those Russian holiday makers who had invaded their country completely by accident
The Lederhosen stereotype is well-known in the UK, just because it's an obvious way of delineating Germans from other people by their dress in cartoons
Then again a lot of our cartoons are American
Not gonna lie that’s what came to my mind
Very efficient
There is a suspicious building lurking in the wood
This sub makes me feel the most depressed
Ordinary city: Fuck modernism
German city: Fuck war
wonder what happened to those buildings
Why is there 1945 berlin
Isn't^
> They're free to change their mind any time as stated in the GFA
Sure, as soon as the Secretary of state for Northern Ireland decided based on their "feelings" that opinions have changed and calls a border poll
The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is a west minister cabinet members that is literally appointed by the monarch
Very wide interpretation of "they" and "whenever" there isnt it
You're right its on advice from the prime minister but they are still the one to approve it
So it cant be called whenever the people of Northern Ireland want and the only way its called for is by a man chosen by the head of the UK government
You arent getting my point, its a person selected by the *UK* who have a vested interest (Conservative and *Unionist* party for example) in refusing a border poll, its not a Northern Ireland representative which would make it "them".
>  then that would be the basis for calling a referendum
But there is literally no mechanism to force one if the secretary for state didnt "feel" that opinions have changed
That is true even if every poll stated otherwise
This is counter to your "whenever" claim
(didnt respond as your edit was after my reply)
I dont really follow what that has to do with the claim that they can call one whenever they want
> The "want" is determined by the polling information I have provided
What
"Whenever they want" is restricted by the *ability* not the desire
The entire issue is with them being able to
> A refusal to act on a swing in public opinion would definitely reignite the Troubles, which nobody wants
Which is still not "whenever they want" because it requires a third party ie the UK government through the Secretary of State to call the border poll to allow them to vote to leave the UK
I made no comment on opinions or what refusing would cause, I commented entirely on the restrictions within the GFA for NI alone to decide to leave the UK
The big mountain range going through it makes it weird
Also in the past everyone in romania lived in small towns of around 1000 people where the neighbours didn't.
Most dots in the west coast of scotland arent cities, just small towns and i think its fairly accurate
The Highland Council area is larger than Belgium and has 230k people (with about 70k of them living in Inverness)
Scotland has 8% of the UKs population, 7% of this poll is negative to the UK
I get it now
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say a good chunk of britons either didnt know these countries were in Europe, or just didnt know these countries
I had an ex-girlfriend who never knew the difference between Northern Ireland and the Republic so I believe it
Because there's a big amount of idiots in the UK
I like to think it’s the Scots who were asked skewing the statistics with Auld Alliance love <3
Asking a Croatia fan after that semi final:
*What part of Croatia are you from
*...Coatbridge
Why do you think we all come
You have beaches, scenery, food and a strange yellow thing that floats about in the sky
We like Russians just not Putin
“But Spain is bigger and so has more space to get drunk and ruin beaches
60% of UK people just don't really have an opinion on Estonia, not quite the same as dislike
Your victory against England in 2016 did endear you to about 5 million Scottish people though
Surrounded by Italy
There’s no way that that column’s accurate lol unless they included literal children in their poll
I mean, 3% of the population not having any idea what Ireland and Russia are, and yet more people know of Slovakia is just ridiculous
“I don’t like Estonia all that much, but _don’t even get me started on Liechtenstein
I don’t think Brexit was based on _dislike_ of any European country
So don’t take it personally :), we still love u! It’s actually really depressing seeing all of the comments in this sub hating on the U.K. based on 51% of the countries preferred position in/out of a union
Nah we love you don’t worry
Turkey is (or rather, was, before COVID) a popular holiday destination
I imagine quite a lot of the positive views come from that
No but neither is the U.K., or many other countries in this chart
This subreddit is for Europe, the continent, not the EU
I don't think I've ever heard somone in the UK disliking Spaniards
Jokes about French and Germans sure, and some genuine dislike for certain eastern European countries, but never Spain
what makes you think that put of interest
Maybe some grumpy old expats I guess complaining how things are not to there liking
I mean, even that, when people call leave voters stupid, selfish, racist etc
it’s extreme, because taking such a strong view of _half the country_ is really harsh, and I think it’s unlikely that half the country are as bad as people seem to present Brexit voters as
I mean fundamentally Brexit was about whether the U.K. would be better in or out of an economic union, it’s not like Brexit voters really did anything that should be insulting to Europe
At this point the government are more the ministry of silly wanks
> The EU, almost since its beginning, has been neoliberal
So, yes, it's aligned to parties on the right
One of possible good outcomes of the UK leaving is that Tories (or Blair like Labour) won't have the excuse of "we implement austerity because of EU rules", they'll have to own it
Except without the restraint and protections offered by the EU, meaning that the general citizenry just get fucked harder
So no, not really a possible good outcome
Anything’s an aircraft carrier if you’re brave enough
Reminds me of Scotland
Exactly
Spain and Italy are thicc
The UK looks so tropical, a shame it’s not true
A majority of the JURI committee is in favour of it
you actually think that will do something
Thank you :)
Believe it or not we still care about Europe very much
Thanks for the love
I'm grateful my Grandfather was from Ireland
I'm in the process of applying for Irish citizenship
The United Kingdom has certainly split down the middle with this decision
Things are going to be very interesting over the next few years
It's also perfectly ok to tell the UK to go fuck itself
You don't have to be polite to a country which spat on you and is willing to break the GFA just to feel superior
Just remember that a lot of us - probably a majority now - don't want Brexit anyway
Many of us are bewildered, angry and very very sad about the whole thing
Keep the door open for us
Hopefully we'll be back soon
To my European friends, from a Eurosceptic Brit (that still managed to see the big picture, and vote Remain)- this is now how these last 3 years should have been spent
I can sympathise with those that voted leave, I really can- and as someone that almost did, let me tell you that it is not with any animosity to the people of Europe
The world is a scary and confusing place, and everything is changing so quickly
The smaller things pushed me away from the EU, and I still have my gripes with those today- but the big picture of Pan-European peace, trade and cooperation was and is worth it
Even given the vote to leave, I think we should have done so in an orderly fashion
But leave orderly or chaotically, be rest assured that the 48% will create a pro-European movement that this country hasn’t seen before
Because we are European
"Sick of all these two-faced snakes
"U ok hun
xxx pop up"
Exactly
I was more meaning the mainland but both works
Aww thanks
Germany is also lovely :)
Constitutional Issues: Section 3:
>it would be wrong to make any change in the status of Northern Ireland save with the consent of a majority of its people
Brexit tells the majority of Northern Ireland to go fuck itself
Which is, by its own admission, a constitutional issue that the GFA explicitly set out to avoid
By purposely doing something that the GFA says not to do, they are breaking it
The majority of N.Ireland voted remain
Brexit changes the status of N.Ireland, especially in relation to Ireland, without the consent of a majority of its people
This part of the GFA is being ignored and Brexit is happening without their consent
Which is the same as telling them to go fuck themselves
You can disagree with this characterization, of course, but in my opinion its an accurate representation of the UK's attitude towards N.Ireland
Though ultimately how we characterize the UK breaking the GFA is irrelevant
All that matters is they're breaking the GFA
Fingers crossed
Ireland has been well supported in /r/scotland
Or, y'know, the UK could just stop dicking about and pointing in the finger
And Brexit is a change in the status of N.Ireland in relation to Ireland, which is what the GFA is about, without the consent of a majority of its people
This doesn't encapsulate "any legal change or foreign policy decision" because the GFA doesn't cover that
It convers the status of N.Ireland and Ireland relations, and any change in that against the will of the majority of N.Ireland breaks the GFA
Not sure how you can say "No" when its spelled out for you in plain English in the source you linked mate
Summer can get to fuck
This is not the year to be putting up with its usual horseshit
anything above 20°c is just too hot for me
And I'm not happy
It's awful
Please turn it off
It got to around 29° here in my area at about 6pm and I was dying
Fuck off 26 degrees is too fucking hot
We had thunder and lightning this morning, then like 24°C sun in the afternoon, then thunder and lightning + heavy rain in the evening
A confusing day all round
As a Scot heading out today as pale as anything l, headed back being red as anything
It's way too hot for me
Yellow crew here 18 degrees with a cool breeze
Perfect
I'd say 15-20 is perfect
Too hot already
Up north it's 18 degrees with a fresh breeze
Perfect
So Scottish summer weather
Jokes on you north of scotland is never hot
18 with a cool breeze it's kinda nice
Not bad 18 and a cool breeze across the moral firth
That's the definition of hell for me
I despise winter
Cold but wet
Everything goes grey like the clouds
It's dark when you go out in the morning and when you get back after work
Extra heating bills
Can't ever get my hands and feet warm
Amplifies the depression 10x.
I'll take hot summer every time
And there's no way 32% is true
A lot of those people are lying
I feel like we all know this will inevitably end with either the bridge/tunnel between Denmark and Sweden, or the Falkirk wheel in Scotland
The Lion turns into a house-cat, and neither Dragons or Unicorns will exist after Brexit
Potato farming will be fine
Thank you, John Knox
By the time of this data, the HRE hadn’t been a thing for the last 100 yrs
Is erosion/subsidence much of a problem there
How do you get the blue things next to your name
Thanks
Next year, I hope you have one
I had to Google it too so no problems in transition
Greece had a 48
I'd probably unironically die of heatstroke
I had problems in the 27° yesterday
I'm sorry, it was 30C in Iceland
I was pouring with sweat working today and it's only 23c or something
I don't know how anyone gets anything done in these hot countries
I went to South East Asia and people kept asking me if I was okay because I was such a mess due to the heat and humidity
Yeah here in Scotland I'm the same
Anything 20 degrees or higher is too hot for me
Pretty much everyone would
I doubt it
I don't remember hearing about "pretty much everyone" in Athens dying of heatstroke in July 1977
England might, Scotland and NI definitely won't
Yeah exactly, this stops the local government ever having to clean the beach of picnic stuff
Nice and all but if you're using an Android device then more than likely you've pretty much given up to Google in terms of privacy already
Of course users should have choice but it's kinda like pissing into the wind for the average user of the average Android smartphone
Good location + educated and trained population
The same things that made Germany rich and developed before the world wars, still existed after the world wars
Germany is smack in the middle of Europe, and riddled with navigable rivers that allow for transportation of goods to all of its neighbours, so that's already a big plus
Add the fact that the engineers, businessmen, operators, etc
who built Germany's industry were still alive after the wars, and they could (relatively) easily pick everything back up and put it back together
Please add Scots "Snaw" (pronounced /snɑː(w)/ in the north and /snɔː/ everywhere else) which interestingly enough is the same as the old english word
You shouldn't even be allowed onto this map, consider yourself lucky
>In reality it will lead to Nigel Farage's Brexit Party winning nearest elections like they did in the EU elections
Not a chance
It'll split the Right-wing vote and guarantee a Labour (probably coalition) government
But depending how far east you go it might be cheaper to just buy tickets
While being from Scotland and utterly hating the tories it's important to note that the Tories went further with this law than the EU by pushing it out to more than just large companies, it was also pushed to pubs and small companies
Not their thing however they did expand on it
Pretty common opinion around here
But they're cunts
The Tories
A bunch of cunts
BBC let them away with it too - I saw this on the TV news and not once was the EU directive mentioned
Pretty common opinion around here
But they're cunts
Make that sausage square and I think we might be into something magical
And if they don't understand, we proceed to repeat exactly what we just said only louder
30 years ago in Spain, there's me black afronted as some guy with his kids shouts louder and louder at the kiosk in the water park "A POKE A CHIPS"
To keep the floods of "watter" out
I once got very drunk with some Latvians, good drinkers
Happy independence day Latvia
That's a political and liturgical issue, not an aesthetic one
Name of the femboy
From Glasgow
And I love this
fortnight battle royal
I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again
It’s a shitty Glasgow
When I was there i heard they put a child in a small tunnel underneath the city with a drum so they knew where he was, he died under there
Some can still hear him beating
I think transpotting takes place in Glasgow
I know the first scene is in Edinburgh but I think the rest is in Glasgow
I can’t really imagine that stuff happening there but it seems like it could happen here
This gives me a massive erection
They smart
[No
It's much more complicated than that
