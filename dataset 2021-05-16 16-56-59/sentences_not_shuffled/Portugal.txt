Despite popular believe that fascism ended with WWII, Portugal kept a fascist dictatorship until 1974
Portugal was the country that started intercontinental slavery
They took slaves from tribes or bought from other tribes where they were taken to the new world (South America - Brazil)
about 15% never arrived in Brazil
They would die of hunger, dehydration or mistreatment during the trip, normally these slaves when they died at sea were simply aitrous to the water
America had Vietnam
We had a war in 4 main fronts, each one thousands of kilometres apart for 14 years
The is still a notion here of it having been a romantic war, with a population eager to embrace Portuguese soldiers as liberators against the communist driven rebels and of Portugal as a mostly benign colonial power whose colonies were lost only because we had a revolution that delivered all colonies to the nearest Moscow inspired rebellious force ( well, I must say I agree with this part
There was a real political will to make sure the "right" party seized power in the former colonies)
What most people ignore is that not all of the war was romantic and that an entire generation still has to deal with the PTSD and physical injuries from that war and also that as other have, we too had our share of wrongdoings while trying to keep a land that was never really ours to take as for instance -
Maybe that’s why some Armenians bomb-attacked Turkey’s embassy in Lisbon in 1983 at one of Portugal’s top neighborhoods
Fuckers
Glad to see you guys put our only science Nobel prize to use
, I suppose
If Istanbul is Turkish then Ceuta and Mellila are Spanish
Ceuta was the first city taken in the portuguese expansion and then passed to the Spanish
Sooo
If they can claim it so can we
Ceuta to Portugal
All Heil the new empire of Portugal, Algarves and Ceuta
Why would I do that
Do you americans only think about destroying things
Jee
Every one in Portugal is happy
We must spare Galiza and Olivença though
Every portuguese is happy
If you eliminate Spain, Portugal and Gibraltar wouldn't be affected :) we also agree with your choice :)
America, like the whole continent
/ s
So beautiful
*Monarchy, technically
But the Vatican is very much ingrained in the EU, much like the other microstates
If I always had a potato stuck in mouth I wouldn't either
Decriminalized consumption of all types of[drugs] If a cop sees you consuming he can only forward your case to a psychologist that will try to help you overcome addition
You can’t go to jail for consuming drugs
Portugal drug policy since 2001 (i think it's the right date, it worked really well)
There's also the mater of handbooks in school being reused and free in order to offer a equal opportunity (although idk if its in only in the lower grade or if it all the regular education ei 1 grade - 12 grade)
Also i think you can have a non binary gender in legal documents
Edit
And also Portugal was the first country in the world to abolish the death penalty
Decriminalisation of all drugs
Portugal was the first country to abolish slavery
We were also the first country to make homophobia a crime against the Constitution back in the 90s.
That's just a scam
Downtown is littered with "drug dealers" that are not actually selling drugs, just random crap (like pressed culinary herbs disguised as weed) to trick tourists
Mixed feelings here, although I consider Portugal a conservative country at least at a cultural level (high percentage of catholic population, everyone is proud of our colonial empire) our politicians seem to have some very progressive ideals
The limit is 10 days worth
I don't know how much that is (really)
Our idea of catholicism is very sui-generis and has nothing to with Spanish catholicism and others
Just think that prior to the marriage equality law we had the highest divorce rate in the entire planet
We fell to the 8th place now, if I'm not mistaken
The gays saved marriage
Consider the following, most people are OK or in favour about gay marriage or don't care and most who identify has Catholic or any other domination of Christianism are not devoted or have a very wishy washi interpretation on Christianism that follow the love thy neighbour has if it was one self, the general love teachings of chist
Only a small minority is actually against, which are the extremely devoted and older generation which normally dominates the group of the extremely devoted
Plus i don't think that we are proud of our colonial past, i think most people are just proud of the sea adventures part of it and mostly the idea of "we went on an unknown path and discovered wonders and how we mark history" kind of proud
Although there's some lack of talk about some of the horrible things we did (like start of Atlantic slave trade for example, i think it should be a topic that should be more discus in school both history classes and philosophy, in order to understand why and how something like that existed and mentality that people to see others has objects and not has people)
Hell since the rise of easy access information a lot of the older generation have been progressively become more ok with gay people, they still think its weird in their minds (mentally of their generation and cultural aspects and historical context (most grow up during the fascist regime that was extremely Catholic in nature))
Is this the new season of "Years & Years"?
Well, we're all fucked
But his picture next to Trump will look interesting
They both look like human canaries
It was all a plan for the United Ireland, 4D chess from the british
When the UK said if we explore the land between Angola and Mozambique they would attack us
King Sebastian being a spoil brat influence by the Catholic and war monger, going to war and then disappearing never to be found causing us to be a royal union with Spain (we maintain boards and government we just share a monarch for only 60 years and got some problems because of that shit, fuck the Spanish monarchy
), but you know us Portuguese we detest the Spanish so we kick their asses and put a new king and be again 100% independent (kinda like some Irish and Scots want to do in relation to their state being in a royal union and wanting to be 100% independent)
Portugal's first King, D. Afonso Henriques, won Portugal's independence by fighting against his own mother, Teresa de Leão.
Letting our 24-year-old, single and childless king go to war against the moors because he wanted to be a saint
We lost, he went missing and we ended up being ruled by Spain for 60 years
Nowadays, that king, Sebastião, is our version of King Arthur
I've recently read that when Junot entered Lisbon with his French army and took over the empty noble houses, the people were so furious they filled with streets with as much human and animal feces they could get
The French were appalled, later the British too
Don't mess with General Winter
For my mother it looked like working double jobs, never having holidays and renting a house in a bad neighbourhood
She never had a computer, never had an LCD screen, never had internet and never knew what's Netflix
She worked to support me and my brother
She works as an unqualified healthcare worker in a public hospital
Her side gig was in a nursing home
Now she's better because she doesn't have to support me and my brother
We never got help from the state, except to pay for University
You live in an ostracized, run down community of gypsies
Clothing and other everyday items are hard to come by, and so you or a relative scrounge and beg for them
You went to public school, but were looked down upon by most other kids, who are taught, it matters not if intentionally or unintentionally, to distrust or even hate you
This dynamic continues in many ways into adulthood
Your community probably has some criminals in it, and you're likely to be grouped alongside them in other people's eyes, regardless if you're an upstanding, law-abiding citizen or not, and no consideration is ever given to how these criminal elements may impact you
Law enforcement likely mistrusts and mistreats you
People believe widely in conspiracy theories involving you and your people, most commonly that you are, in fact, incredibly rich and just pretending to be poor to leech off the hardworking non-gypsies
A far-right political party has recently risen to political relevance that seeks to formalise the brutal but informal discrimination against you
this is some George Orwell shit right here
chills
In Portugal I think if you are heavily in debt they will assign someone to advise/guide you but it is not as easy and subsidize as in the Nederlands which is normal because we are poorer
However there are some subsidies if you are unemployed or bellow poverty line
Masked poverty in Portugal is people in their late 20s and early 30s living in their parents home because they have a job but still can't support themselves, that is what poverty looks like here
PS how do you put your flag in your user name
I think it's a Russian thing
IMHO, no one writes better than the Russians
High-jacking to state some more
Unfortunately,  if you're heavily in debt there are no direct resources to advice you
I disagree with your view on poverty
It's quite worse
Poverty in Portugal is a family of 5 people where the father and mother work at a shoe factory for minimum wage ( 700 euro month), live at a council house with just bearable living conditions and bring some of the shoes home so the kids may help sow them after school
Those kids will never go to college or not even finish mandatory education ( 12 years) because there is no suport or economic capacity for the parents to help
That perpetuates the misery because those kids will end up at the same shoe factory, doing cleaning or construction work for the same measly pay
Real misery, like homelessness is fortunately rare because family always try to help and we have close knit communities that help those in dire needs
We're a country where you can go hungry but you'll never starve to death or be denied health care because we have social services that prevent such things
Let's just sum it up saying that we have a of people just existing and not having a life
Working their asses off just to get going, with no prospect of improving their lives
I felt exactly like this was an Orwellian dystopia
said it before reading this
Yes I agree with you
But the thing is those young people I mentioned are not doing much more than the minimum wage, even if they have graduated from college
So as they are educated they will probably never have kids because they know they can't provide for them, they are also just surviving
In this situation, if the children got into uni, they could apply for a scholarship from DGES and most likely would get it
This is just like a messed up edition of survivor
Problem is, this show has been going on for too long with no ending on sight
Same politics for 45 years and no change in sight
No wonder we're still leaving the country to be able to have a life
Correct
That's why I mentioned the lack of support
Those kids have almost no incentive to excel academically because they could be working to help support the family
True, I agree
Yes, definitely
I feel like I'm losing my portuguese and like I'm not good enough at english, so it's bad either way
I was talking to my mother yesterday and she corrected my portuguese because I used the direct translation of "in person" during the conversation
My master is taught in English so when I use vocabulary from my field of studies is very difficult for me to use portuguese terms to explain something
In all the other stuff I really prefer to speak in my native language cause I tend to think in portuguese and then translate to english
Yes
I have to use English daily on my job
Whenever I come back to Portugal sometimes I start to speak in English randomly without noticing
But the thing that pisses me off the most is when I'm speaking my native language and cannot remember how to say a certain word in Portuguese, only in English
Definitely, my native languages are Portuguese and Mandarin
In Portuguese a lot of the times I can't remember words which I know in English and Spanish, as for Mandarin, I sound like a foreigner who took a semester of it in college
It's funny, I used to have French at school, but everyone knew English way better than French (because we had more years of it) so for the French exams we had to constantly stop ourselves from writting in English
How are you so sure that your dog barks in English
Or your cat meows in English
Yeah but I mean imagine that your cat starts to eat pizza all day and then it would start to meow with the hands like [this] Could be an italian speaking cat
Our accent is not very noticeable I would say
You may realise that we are not English of course but I don't think people will know we are portuguese
Yes, although I don't have much of it
However I enjoy the Portuguese accent a lot
Somehow, from interacting even with Portuguese in English it feels like our "real" english, if that makes any sense
Sometimes I'll even try to lay on the accent if I am speaking with another portuguese in english (word or expression)
I'd rather not have an accent but I don't mind speaking english because of it anymore
Me having some speech impediments also doesn't a lot with it, I have some trouble pronouncing 'j', soft 'g' and I tap my Rs way too much, making an already quite slavic sounding accent, sound even more slavic
Yank here
I love love all euro accents
I do have favorites tho
Irish, Brit, German, Polish, and my adopted country Portugal  saúde
I do i sound like a 25 year old dude speaking in english, then when i speak in portuguese i sound like i am 13 ;---;
I've heard a lot of German English accents, some very stereotypical and others not so much, and honestly there's nothing wrong with how they sound
If anything I dislike it when Germans (as well as other nationalities) go for American accents because it creates a sort of uncanny valley effect imo
That being said I did use to have German flatmate who had a really good American accent and didn't sound weird at all
True
Já agora podes me dizer como conseguiste ter a bandeira ao lado do nome
I think the most noticeable is our guttural "L", but that's such an idiosyncratic part of our language, no one else can pinpoint it
Na app do telemóvel penso que é mais fácil
Entras nesta subreddit e do lado direito em cima tens 3 pontinhos
Carregas lá e diz algo como "add flaire" ou algo do género e escolhes a bandeira que queres
Imo, speaking to native English speakers is intimidating because you feel like you're being judged
I have no problem speaking to my non native English speaking classmates, but my classmates from England make me feel self conscious
Little dots
As a native English speaker
I'm not judging you when you speak English
Se falares mal português é que vou começar a julgar
I'm not getting weird looks or anything, I just feel that way because I put this unnecessary pressure on myself to speak perfectly, with perfect grammar, and without an accent, despite being aware that it is nearly impossible
Speaking to non native speakers gives me more room to make mistakes because I know they can relate
My English classmates are really nice, friendly people, I have nothing bad to say about them
The real question is why are iphones more popular in North America than androids
They are much more expensive and are not better
That's what I think is the main difference between Europe and America
People are not ashamed for being called "poor". In my country you Will be highly judged if you say that you receive a minimum wage and you're holding and iPhone on your hand, because it is a signal that you only care about apparencies
Since smartphones exist, I've had a Samsung, a Sony and a Xiaomi, all androids
Because with the money I saved by buying an android instead of an iPhone, i can make 2 or 3 trips abroad
It's a matter of priorities
Edit: here minimum wage is 600€ and an iPhone costs 800/900€
So do ours
WhatsApp is still better and far more convenient than regular texting
In Portugal, Lisbon is the black sheep for everywhere but Lisbon
For Lisbon, I suppose, the rest of the country is the backwater
Can't say I'm ashamed of any city in particular but Amadora seems pretty shitty as do a lot of places in "Linha de Sintra".
According to TVI in Portugal, portuguese people are ashamed of Porto and the north of the country in general
The name makes it sound a lot prettier than it actually is
Not Rostock
That city is just weird that big church in the middle and those soviet blocs, was there for a day and felt like an alien a lot of russian speakers, went to mcdonalds near of the train station and everyone was looking at me weirdly for trying to speak english
Isn't São Paulo a very important city economically speaking though
Vienna is pretty nice, though
And surprisingly quiet for a capital city
That's just a war between us and TVI, don't believe them they are fake news
Thought it was beautiful when I went there, but there way too few bins and the ones I find were tiny and full of trash
Littering seems to be a pretty big problem there
Lived there for one year, and I just have mixed feelings about the city
It's very very far from being an amazing fantastic city, but it's not as bad as the media seems to depict it
Compared with other Swede cities it is rough
So imagine the other cities
I'm portuguese, it was sarcasm
Foi uma piada, SÓ UMA PIADA
It was a joke
There was a problem with one channel because they discribed Porto's people s beeing old and uneducated
It isn't true btw
It’s usually just a disparity between the north and south where the north is mocked for its education and accent and the south is mocked for being uptight and rich and lazy
Porto being the north’s biggest city it’s usually seen as the representation of the north
A german friend told me that nowadays Rostock is more or less tha capital pf Nazis in germany
Is it true
Fair enough
What's so bad about the city anyway
Genuine question
I know Rio de Janeiro gets a really bad reputation but you never hear much about São Paulo
Eu sei
Mas quem não sabe o que se passou pensa que estás a falar a sério
Relacionado com o futebol é verdade
Com tudo o resto não
I would say that Dresden or Görlitz are worst in this regard, but they are very beautiful cities (unlike Chemnitz city centre)
Strange for a city that was once called Kar-Marx-Stadt to be nazi nowadays
Isso vai depender sempre do clube que és e vais dizer sempre que o rival é a vergonha do país. Mas a verdade é que toda a nossa cultura futebolística é uma bosta, basta ver os comentadores que têm mais audiências no nosso país, tipo o Pedro Guerra e o Serrão.
EU estou a falar com a perpetiva de um lisboeta, as pessoas prefeririam se a liga nos nao fosse 80% clubes do norte
Mas n há propriamnete um ódio ( exceto ao fcporto, por razões obvias)
Ok já deu para perceber que és benfiquista
Isto de a liga nos ter 80% dos clubes no norte do país não é por acaso
De Coimbra para baixo as pessoas só vêem Sporting e Benfica, e é difícil para os clubes do centro e sul contrariarem esse poderio
No norte, apesar de haver um claro domínio do Porto tens muito mais gente a apoiar o clube da cidade
Tens o Braga, o Vitória de Guimarães, o Famalicão e até o próprio Boavista leva sempre mais de 5 mil pessoas ao estádio
Isto não é por acaso
Contra factos não já argumentos, mas oque eu disse antes é o sentido que as pessoas não-nortenhas podem ter
E já agora, SOU SPORTINGUISTA
E no caso do braga n sei se concordo, a maioria das pessoas de braga apoia jm dos três grandes, e nem contra os grandes e europa conseguem encher o estádio
My bad
Nunca pensei ver esse ódio ao Porto vindo de alguém que não fosse do Benfica
Sim quanto a Braga tens razão, eu estudei lá e sei como é. Tem muito historial de adeptos do benfica e alguns do Porto, mas digo te que as mentalidades estão a mudar e há cada vez mais adeptos do Braga
Embora lá está, não como em Guimarães que é só Vitória e mais nada
Não é tanto ódio como um benfiquista
Já temos demasiados problemas internos para ter muitos problemas com outros clubes
Exatamente ahah o maior rival do Sporting é o próprio Sporting
We don’t even bother trying to come up with excuses
Being late is the default
"Sorry, cows" when someone asks
I live in the Azores and we have a lot of cows, like a shit ton, and many pastures between houses and towns so early in the morning and late in the afternoon the farmers and pastors need to move them around
We (Portugal) are just late, plain and simple, no excuses
came here to say this
being late it's part of our DNA
If you say to your guests to come to dinner at 20:00 and they show up at 20:00 or even a little earlier it's bad seen
How could they come so early if you hadn't have time to start to prepare the meal
So everyone gathers at the kitchen drinking with empty stomachs
so true ️️️
Honestly, I can't even remember ever seeing a bridge that opens here in Portugal
Can't you use tinder
Plenty of cows over there
I'm sure there are recipes online
Leixões
Not that it's an excuse, since there's another one, a normal one, fairly close to it
We have a way with people, trust me
Also,
#DRINKS AT THE BAR FER A POUND, COME GET YOUR COFFEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
EDIT: Right who the FUCK gave this shit gold
The typical office worker, works itself half to death but doesn't get a decent pay and dreams of climbing the ranks to get a better pay someday
Either that or PR
As long as the Netherlands aren't in charge of Museum security
Cleaning bathrooms, most likely
Portugal would be the boss
The guy taking coffee or taking photocopies to the boss
Portugal
We would be the toilet
-And tell me, Turkey, would you be as flexible as to drop your death penalty for the company

Please, do
Or we could be the guy that works at travel agency

This person is out here writing a telenovela about Europe as an office

In 2004, but some of your *ahem*...current leaders wanted to bring it back and still get into the EU
That said,
#AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Thanks
I hate it
This was made by the same people that made Mr
Pickles
We smuggled Brazil into the company and now they work in the bar
Quick
Get the cachaça!
Same animation style [see]
Yep
I use american spelling but sometimes a british word or expression sneaks through
Like "reckon".
I personally speak BE with a British accent, so
Aye, american vocabulary + phonetics and british writting
Used to mix both a lot but after living in England for 5 years that is mostly gone
I can see that happening a lot when someone comes to visit me and speaks English in a very Americanised way
For example my gfs sister still say "yorkshaiar" (Yorkshire) and "det" (that)
To be honest I never experienced a huge shock because I kind of knew what to expect I guess
I've been to New York, Boston, and Orlando
Even though I had an idea of what New York would be like, I was still blown away by Manhattan
There's really nothing like it in Europe
I mean sure you get some places with quite a few skyscrapers, but Manhattan really is like a concrete jungle
Boston on the other hand, didn't feel too different from the cities you find in Europe (I suppose because it's one of the earliest American cities)
As for Orlando, I don't remember much of it as I went there with my family before the 2008 crisis and only recall the theme parks
One thing that I guess could be described as culture shock was paying with a 5 dollar note and getting my change back in notes
It's weird to me that 1 dollar notes even exist
Also being asked to show ID at a bar
How hard it is to walk in smaller cities
Everything is designed around cars
Want to go to the mall across the street
There’s a 6 lane road, good luck crossing that
If you somehow manage to do it, you still have to cross a gigantic parking lot that is like 10% full
The clothes size
I am M here, S in the us would be xxl for me
But are the buildings as tall and packed together as they are in Manhattan
I'm aware that there are huge cities in China (hopefully I'll get to see them someday), but aside from Hong Kong aren't they a little more spread out
I just assumed Americans had super low balls
You ask someone from my country for directions, he will go with you to the place so you dont get lost
There are jokes about this
That's a Scandinavian thing
Here in Portugal, kids cannot address teachers by their first names
It would be considered very rude
We always gotta call them "teacher".
I see this happening here too
People are in generaly kind, it always depend how you aproach them
Last summer I was leaving from the beach and this british lady with her son couldnt get their rental car to start, 5 different guys helped pushing the car and then by miracle there was a guy who was a mechanic and had tools, he fixed the car and she could go
There are some funny encounters
That was my experience when studying in Scotland
I knew not to greet girls there with a kiss on the cheek, but then I'd suddenly get hugged which felt a little too up close and personal
Cultural differences are funny
Luanda Leaks was a huge scandal in January in Portugal involving the richest woman in Africa, the Angolan Isabel dos Santos, which is the daughter of the former president Eduardo dos Santos
She owns many companies all over the world, specially in Portugal, and including the telecommunications NOS, and there were some news  recently telling this "NOS replaces managers linked to Isabel dos Santos with managers linked to Isabel dos Santos"
I think the Portuguese authorities have been very responsible, they’re not using covid-19 to do nothing under the radar imo
The olive tree disease is worrying
Not just to us, but it is passing under the radar and this could be very damaging agriculturally
On the other direction, normally we could be worried about drought,  in the past month it has rained a lot and drought seems less severe now
Normally we could be talking LOTS of the weather, or hailstorms or stuff, now, nope, nothing
Isabel dos Santos
They got the fuel prices lower now that people can't leave home, just to make people mad
(Sorry, it's just a joke attempt)
like what
I don’t think so
The prime minister didn’t want the state of emergency declared, but the president did it anyways
And he’s visibly worried and somewhat overwhelmed by the powers it gives him
Isn’t that a good thing
Well but instead of asking for money and remaining private, wouldn’t giving money and becoming the owner be better
It can now work for public interest
In Portugal we have TAP and they also ask for money and most of us would prefer for it to be nationalized again
Afonso
Quite and old but still common name
Men: Arlindo, Américo, Basílio, Eurico, Valdemar
Women: Esmeralda, Gertrudes, Joaquina, Leopoldina, Lurdes
For men: Sancho, Lopo, Cid, Inácio, Zeferino, Hermenegildo, Augusto
For women: Urraca, Estefânia, Eunice, Gertrudes, Virgínia
Maybe Sancho
Clotilde, Aurora, Felizberto, Américo
In Portugal, women names that have Maria and something else, like Maria de Fatima, Maria da Conceição, Maria de Lurdes
For men something like Hermenegildo, Álvaro, Xavier, Hermano, Alcides
João for boys and Maria for girls
Bernardo is a relatively popular name in Portuguese and doesn’t sound old to us at all, interesting
Afonso é um nome transversal a todas as gerações
Bonifácio ou Teodoro são nomes exclusivamente de velhos
I remember Urraca, she was Raimunda's sister right
Alfonso is the Arab version of Afonso, you know, because most words start with Al, you kbow
Não vamos esquecer a Odete, este nome parece que vem com bengala
Aníbal, também.
Our first king married raimunda, and like the Galician one married urraca
Well i think it's right step in the right direction, although i think there should be bigger coordination and cooperation between the European nations and kinda do follow what Portugal and other countries are doing in relation to implementation of renewable energy increasing it and reducing other non renewable sources and being power almost exclusively by renewable energy, about more than half of the energy consumption in Portugal is by renewable energy
I think technology wise we should invest in the development of battery of high capacity and do a open patent for the world and maybe create a international European car company that that only sells electric car and try to make them accessible for average European
Urging consumers to be woke won't make a big dent
Urging voters might
In pretty much every country the main polluters are electricity suppliers
We can all change to electric cars but if the electricity is dirty
It happened to me a couple of times with podcasts
I was listening to an English podcast and the next one happened to be in Portuguese, and for a second there my brain totally fried and I didn't know how to interpret the language
As soon as I realized it was Portuguese I immediately began understand it normally
Haha I do this as well when speaking Portuguese
Portugal:
Portuguese borders (A Raia) are the oldest of any European country, and have remained unchanged since 1927 (also one of the oldest in the world)
After being crowned king, the portuguese monarch D. Pedro crowned the love of his life, D. Inês, who had been murdered by orders from his father
He had the murderer's heart ripped out from the chest while alive, so he could feel the same pain he had
He then sat the dead queen on the throne with her crown, and had the whole court kiss her hand to repay her respect
It is absolutely untrue that portuguese people hate spaniards; we actually tolerate them pretty well, considering
Because of the period of the Discoveries, some local languages adapted portuguese words; my favorite is the Japanese word for "barbecue" : "churrasco" / "shurasuko" ~~"thanks": "arigato" / "obrigado"~~; a strange one for me is that in some languages like Greek, "Portugal" is synonymous of "Orange".
I was just kidding about the spaniards: we actually like them quite a lot, you know, considering
In fact they are the only country that has a sexual position named after them in our lexicon
Edit: I've fallen victim of a popular misconception about the origins of the Japanese word Arigato, which is strictly Japanese
Portugal has the oldest borders in the world
Portugal started the discovery age
It is said that the portuguese colonized Newfoundland and Labrador, due to former portuguese currency found in the area
The first man to go on a trip around the world was portuguese
The flag that is on the moon was made in Portugal
There are much more
Portugal's borders have remained pratically unchanged for 800 years, making them the oldest in Europe
The Portuguese Empire was the first global empire in history, and lasted 500 years making it also the longest
Portuguese is spoken natively by 25x more people outside of Portugal than in Portugal itself
The Portuguese were the first europeans to ever make contact with Japan
Portugal and England have the longest alliance still enforced in the world, starting in 1373 (647 years
We have more time as a dictatorship than democracy
Despite most people ignoring Covid precautions, we only have 50 000 cases since the pandemic started
(population of around 11 million)
Our famous "Pastéis de Belém" are so shit compared to other national versions of them that they refuse to participate in the flavor contest because they know that they would lose
By a LOT
We are the only country in the world to have ever filled for bankruptcy TRICE, and have just recently payed for the first one
('round 2008)
We (along with Spain, each had half) controlled the entire world's sea and, businesses depending on it
About the second point portugal's old anthem used to mention the british: " against the british march march" they then changed it later
Why do polish and italy anthems mention each other
This is a family sub, so I'll use Wikipedia's translation as "mammary intercourse".
Also, fun fact, the German and French also refer to it as the "spaniard", while in Spanish it  references almost any other country expect Spain, i.e. "Cubana", "chaqueta rusa", "una francesa, turca, o sueca" (in english: "the Cuban", "the Russian jacket", "The French", the Turkish", or still, "the sweedish")
Euthanasia is up for debate in parliament again so it's usually some variation of we want to murder all old people or euthanasia is eugenics (and everyone who supports it is as bad as the nazis)
Lovely
Holy tits
Really
Wow
well, not that
I mean, there are problems, but now they sound really more like inconveniences
"Não matem os velhinhos"
Oh god don't get me started on this, I know alot of religious people so I keep seeing Facebook posts about how eutanasia is making a doctor commit a murder, plus the Christian lobby is going all out asking for a referendum, which is dumb because it will pass if it goes to referendum
I mean believe whatever you want but don't impose your religion on my choice not to suffer unbearble pain
Funny how socialism is anti-racist and those types of beliefs come from deeply racist beliefs
I loved hungary but you guys do not like tourists or foreigners, can't imagine what its like to be a black guy in Hungary
Social services in the UK have a really bad reputation among foreigners
My friends in the UK with kids all complain about them
This fucking meme
Completely agree
Everyone should be able to choose what to do with their lives, bodies and conditions
Abortion has thankfully been legal for a good amount of years, hopefully euthanasia will follow suit and be approved soon enough
Ah, every day I grow more thankful that I don't use Facebook
I seriously never get their arguments, no one's making you choose to be euthanised, if you think your body is "sacred" or whatever, go right ahead, why should that have anything to do with what other people choose to do
We also have separation of church and state so I fail to see why priests that go on TV think they have any more say in this than the average person, but whatever
The your exercise is much creative
When is that it created
The my friends found the way the english wrote and spoke weird, but the other languages in comments are way more funny because I personally don't them know
I'll "translate" an excerpt of the Wikipedia page on cod from english to Portuguese sentence structure English
Original: "The two most common species of cod are the Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), which lives in the colder waters and deeper sea regions throughout the North Atlantic, and the Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus), found in both eastern and western regions of the northern Pacific
"Translated" : "The two species most common of cod are the cod of the Atlantic (Gadus morhua), that lives in the waters most cold and sea regions most deep throughout the Atlantic North, and the cod of the Pacific (Gadus macrocephalus), found in both the regions east and west of the pacific of the north
Well, [I] no know if am doing this well, but am trying
Think that the biggest difference on the grammar is the verbs and the omission of pronouns
Need to speak about anything
Am become dizzy while read this whole thing
Is probably best if don't speak about anything at all
The your comment is unexpected
I not make idea that the structure of the Spanish was so different
Now that I am writing this, start I to understand that we the Portuguese speak like man-caves
A hug from Portugal, brother Spanish
Even Saint Anthony would break his waterpot reading this Southernmost province of Portugalada
Had stroke while reading this
We are men of the caves
Have almost the certainty that almost all the rules gramatical in Portuguese are equal in Galician
I'd like a list, actually, now I'm curious
Ah, for sure there are pronunciation differences
I was more talking about sentence structures like the rest of the thread
yes obviously
I dont like football so I'm not the best example
But honestly, I've heard so many reports of thousands of (mostly foreign) construction workers that have died to build that stadium
Qatar can reach like 50ºC in the summer, and they were working long hours
Fuck Qatar
I've never heard of that country's team being anything special
so why do they want to host the WC
My country would never boycott a football competition unfortunately, it's our main sport and we have a team of stars
It's too much money down the drain
Dirty money
I never liked the idea of a tiny hot as hell country like Qatar hosting the World Cup
There was a lot of corruption behind that FIFA decision
What a joke
But I don't want Portugal to boycott it
Footballers are paid to play football
If there's a tournament, they'll play
They aren't political activists
Honestly, if we manage to qualify, yes
I believe that my country should boycott the Dubai 2022 Cup
In principle yes, but OTOH it is like our best shot ever to actually, maybe who knows, win it, so we can not afford to waste an opportunity while your current captain and star player is still playing
And we really really want to win it one day
Also if a lot of european countries boycott, it just gets easier, more likely right
Not that it will be easy, it never is, but still, if France boycotts, oh hello
Yes, I would and futebol is a huge thing in my country
I hope at least some of the really big players, like Cristiano Ronaldo, opt out this time
The last-last government sold profitable state companies at a low cost
The same government that, while in a steep financial crisis which lead to many people losing jobs and their homes, told their own population to find a job outside the country or to be less mushy
OH GOD DO I HAVE A GOOD ONE FOR THIS
So, Portugal has a conservative party (CHEGA)
Its presidente, *André Ventura* is kind of a dumb ass, the typical xenophobic and nationalist I guess
*But* he's also a writer
So imagine the fun we have hearing him yelling in the parlament and then remembering his books have quotes such as: *Oh how would it be to penetrate her, dominate her until I feel that miserably proud body give in a final sneeze, orgasmic* (page 38)
He has also said to another president (of a liberal party, as an attack): *The Livre deputtee must've been smoking dangerous things, the illegal kind*
AND he said, about the same president (who's a woman natural from an African region) that we should deport her back, after she proposed indemnities to ex colonies
I like to think of him as our own little miniature Trump
On another note, our cities are too crowded, maybe we should have more cities to make space for our people to live in
He also said:
“The poorest were not affected by cuts"
"We want to go beyond the troika"
"Portugal only comes out of the crisis by becoming impoverished"
“Being unemployed can be an opportunity”
"I will not raise taxes"
“We cannot live beyond our means”
“Fuck the elections”
He believes in treating everyone equally
He’s a god damn fascist
Don’t compare Dilma to that fucking fascist
It was a clusterfuck
But I'm glad we found a way out
EDP was created in 76, but TAP in 45
They were our biggest airline and energy company
Imagine comparing Dilma to a guy that is willing to let hundreds of thousands die because of the stock market
Was that Austrian fella that end up ruling German short
In photos and videos he seems average size for his time
And also taller than some other politicians of the time
I have a feeling that it is another propaganda myth in the same vein as Napoleon was really short
I don't know, honestly
And it doesn't end there - when they sold them at a black friday price, they didn't lower taxes
It's an EPP party, they were trying to shift everything to private hands, but I'm glad it didn't happen
That's just for display, they're conservative liberals
The Socialist party are the social democrats, and their "radicalisation level" depends on the PM and of what the marxist leninists and the trotskyists parties want
Sorry I didn't understand what you meant
In 76, they choose to integrate together with a conservative party, so it resulted in having  the faction that wanted the SDP model, and the faction that wanted economic liberalism
Nowadays, they are more social democracy leaning, because of their current leader
But there's a clash between factions of the party because one half of the party wants him and the other doesn't.
Seeing those embezzlers mad af when he got elected was a pleasure, though
I mean, corruption is inherent to an autocracy / dictatorship, so that's why corruption scandals didn't exist / uncovered, because things simply weren't recorded or if they were, it wouldn't matter
But yeah, embezzlers are also a risk that the people need to watch out for
Maybe it's because of the [millions] he spent trying to wash the regime
In authoritarian states, corruption occurred, but it remained anonymous
Without any free press, how can you say corruption happened
You have no idea of how authoritarian he was
He was an authoritarian corporatist, which involved the direct injection of money on the elites
No football
There goes half the newscast
And since there are no other cultural events, every report on the news is about coronavirus
There was even a report about how the RTP team in France couldn't do a report, because they were quarantined
It's already happenning: Our biggest national productor of beer closed its production :(
yeah btw why do all protests in France involve turning cars around and make fires
Nevermind I went to check and it was fake news
Of monster and men
don't be sorry, we should be thanking you
Hatari were great
Sure, can we be included in this deal too
We don't have it either and could also use the added benefits of being connected to the rest of western Europe and Europe in general tbh
Afaik all works in that regard have lead to a full stop in quite some years now
The projects are abandoned
As far as I've been told, there's simply not enough funds for us to carry it out and the idea was chucked out
That's the notion I got some years ago, on that matter, at least
I don't think I've even heard about the project moving forward, ever since Socrates ceased being prime minister
Nah, right now Portugal is building a line between Évora and Badajoz that's roughly the way the high speed line would be
In the future it will serve as a basis for a truly high speed connection between Lisbon and Madrid, provided the biggest investment is made (Lisbon's third bridge)
Yeah, at least there's that silver lining to this story
I read some of the top comments and then I look for Portugal
I actually never see any comment from my country
It's rare here
I remember seeing one on tv recently
I think it was an unicef ad
But it's not very common
I don't think we get any over here, can't recall anything at least
Well ads not a lot, although there are a few occasionally on TV, although there's during the entire year not always but especially around Christmas charities that patterned with big store so that clients pay a little more or donate x amount during the checkout in order to help charity groups but those are not always about Africa and are more charitable cause be it international or national
We the Portuguese have the ideia of Africa namely our ex colonies suffering starvation and bad economical problem (which has far has i know its true and especially in some ex colonies) because of the immigration and emigration and what people there described and what we see on the news
Hallelujah
The first time I saw it I had no idea what it was supposed to be or how to pronounce it, it's just completely different to the portuguese spelling
> For me it was Spaniard
For the longest time I thought it was a disgraceful word for Spanish people
Same for me with Spanish "chino". Always felt like a rude word for a Chinese person to me, but it really is just the Spanish word for Chinese
That sounds like a word a Portuguese person would make up as a joke
Espuma is Portuguese for foam
In Portuguese we have "negro," which is the same as "preto
" When referring to a black person I hear that, supposedly, one of these words is offensive and the other is not
I honestly don't know which is supposed to be and which isn't.
Yeah, that's the definition in Portuguese (chá/infusão) and English (tea/infusion)
If it doesn't have the tea plant in it, it's just an infusion or herbal tea, technically
In portuguese is similar to your alternative, Aleluia
Porque «chino» em português pode aportar uma conotação pejorativa
Se bem que nem é uma expressão comum de se usar por cá.
I saw them in stores and would usually take them home
Never recieved one in the mail though
I usually got one in my mailbox around early september or so
Not real mail mail, just an unwrapped, unaddressed catalogue their distributors left in my street
Usually
I do not remember if I got one this year or not
Surprisingly useful though of course I understand why they stopped, on the last clear out we must have thrown away 6 catalogues or so
Here where I live, in North Litoral Portugal, this year has actually been the opposite
The 2018/19 winter was freezing, particularly cold, though it was very dry
The summer was very wild, I can count on my fingers the days that registered +30 degrees celsius, and August was a bit rainy
Really I always thought this was a French thing
Here in Portugal u can tell French tourists by their Goose down  jackets all year around
Heck when my French friends who live in Lisboa go to the movies with us they bring their down jackets and scarves
It gets cold here
Sweaters,  jacket and scarves but only for 2-3 months rest of year pleasant
Not at all
( Unless those times we lose against Germany on European / World cups)
I personally don't have any problems with Germans
Someone's home country doesn't matter, their views might, depending on what they are
I've also never heard of anything negative about them here, but I'm not social nor go out much
We dont have an anti german sentiment
As isolated as we are the only sentiment we have is towards our spanish neighbours
It was definitely a strong sentiment around 2011, give or take
And it was obviously directed at Germany as a state/government, not the people
Still, it has kind of died out now
Like the other user said, we only hate playing against them in football [because we'll lose :(]
I thought [Misako] – meaning: my bag, but written in a different way – was Japanese, it’s Spanish
I thought exactly the same
Rockstar Games is based in New York City, and is a subsidiary of Take-Two Interactive which is also based there
Rockstar North is the developer of the main Grand Theft Auto games and is based in Edinburgh
The series was created by DMA Design, which was Rockstar North's original name when they were based in Dundee (sidenote: hey also developed Lemmings
Rockstar Leeds is responsible for the handheld spin-off games Liberty City Stories, Vice City Stories and Chinatown Wars
They aided in the development of the main games as well if I'm not mistaken
And I thought it was Turkish
I thought it was British
TIL
I have read an article and it said that, to a degree it’s almost gibberish
IKEA on the other hand, couldn't scream it any louder
not that I mind though, meatballs are awesome
Sorry for my ignorance, but who is Bernie Sanders
Ah, ok thanks
Edit: Answering the question above i would say that it is working quite good tbh, im not big on those stuff but noone is complaining so that's gotta be good right
I live in an Atlantic Island , the main type of rock is basalt and water is abundant especially on the northen coast and on the Mountains
As the water is has not many minerals it is good to drink if you have kidney stones and is not poluted because there is not much industry
If you came here, I'd offer you water in a bottle
But it's actually tap water that I put in a bottle to put in the fridge
This is common in Portugal
I always drank tap water, I think most of us do here
I drink nothing but tap water
Can't remember the last time I bought a bottle of water
I think most people consume bottled water here
I do, and so does everyone I know
but I have to admit most of the time the problem's not with the water itself but the tubes, lol
It's the norm, I'd say
Bottled water is for when you don't have access to tap water or when it's easier to drink from the bottle at that moment
but when the latter's the case, it's often personal bottles with tap water
At least in the places I've been in my country, tap water is great, so I assume that's the norm nationwide
I actually feel bad now for the countries with shit tap water :/
Tap water is the standard in Portugal, I only buy bottled water when I need it on the go
In Portugal i lived near a spring so I would just get it from there
It was beautiful
In England I started using Brita because both tap water and bottled water where really horrible in taste (almost as bad as Spanish bottled water)
Blue that I'm in Italy I still use Brita but my in laws but bottled as they mainly drink sparkling water for some reason
It was weird to me how common sparkling water is here
Tap Water in Portugal is top notch quality, fortunately
I and a lot of people I grew up with in Portugal weren't connected to municipal water services, the water came from a well and was unsafe to drink
Now we are finally on municipal water but my parents still don't trust it
Now I live in the UK and I even use my Brita to rinse my hair in the end
Most of my compatriots are saying that consuming tap water is the norm
But not in Alentejo and Algarve definitely
Here the water is very bad because it comes from small lakes next to the farmlands and they use a lot of chlorine to disinfect it
Also the water is very hard, as you can see in the image . [The red stands for hard water]
Grew up always drinking tap water
The tap water in Lisbon has a really weird taste to me (it’s perfectly safe to drink though) so I just got a Brita filter when I moved there
I think bottled water is a scam honestly, and only buy it if I’m out and about and get thirsty
Neither is common
Instead of fridges having a built in water dispenser, we put tap water in a bottle and put it in the fridge
I never buy bottled water unless I'm traveling, but it's pretty common to go to a friend's place and they offer me bottled water because they don't think tap water
I think if you drink only tap water since you're a kid you just get used to it, and vice versa
I think it depends on the region and piping, when I go on vacation to the South I am advised to not drink the tap water there
Bom saber
Eu pessoalmente não conheço ninguém que beba água do cano, mas se calhar depende da região.
For me it happens basically everyday
Worst thing is when I'm trying to explain something to my parents and I can't find the word in portuguese (they know almost nothing in english so saying the actual word I'm thinking about doesn't help)
Very frustrating ahahah
It happens to me quite a lot, mainly in things related with my field of study (Finance) since I have learned most of these words in English
Happened to me a lot, so I pledged to give way more attention and care to my native tongue
Very rarely, and it's sad to see so many of you forgetting your native language
Too often
Now I'm in a weird situation where I'm not very good at speaking english but I speak english so much that I mix english words with portuguese words
&#x200B;
So now I suck at both languages
Never call us Spanish
And don't try to speak spanish in Portugal, it is better to speak in english instead
Never, never call a Portuguese person , Spanish
Don't you dare
Foregneirs talking in Spanish to us, instead of english (or portuguese)
It's way more common than you may think, and it's just plain offensive and stupid, especially when both people involved know that you're Portuguese and both speak good English
It mostly happens because either they think Spanish is our language or that is similar enough that we understand it better (and most times they speak trashy Spanish to you)
It's just plain offensive
Only the portuguese eat codfish
Any other codfish is fake codfish
Do not disrespect codfish
If it's the first time you come here, and see codfish, just say it's very good and you've never seen it before
Uhm, such culture, so good
Keep it at that and get ready to hear 50 facts about codfish
Not being polite
If you are asking for directions, say hi first, if you’re entering a small shop, say hi, say thank you if someone helps you
Being cordial is very important
Don’t bring that “the customer is always right” attitude here, everyone will just think you are rude and entitled
Also, don’t speak Spanish to us
If you know Spanish we can probably understand you and most people will try to communicate anyway, but just make it clear you’re not assuming the languages are the same
Portugal is a very old country, with a very strong national identity
We get a bit sensitive about people just merging us with Spain because we’re a smaller country
In the Madeira and Açores islands - saying you are coming to/from Portugal (portuguese ppl from continental Portugal are the main offenders)
Being a foreigner and criticising Portuguese culture or food
(Big inferiority complex)
Calling an adult that you are not close friends with, that has college degree, without mentioning his "title":
- It's Doctor (or engineer or architect  etc) Manuel, not Mr
I think it's not a problem at all to speak Spanish, the problem assuming we speak Spanish
My Spanish is crap
I'm 1000 time more comfortable speaking english
Lol, my gf is Ukranian
I was with her dad in the car and had just bought some flowers
He looked at it, picked it up, threw one out of the window, put it back and just went "you'll thank me later".
It was confusing as hell
TIL portugal and italy share basically every NO NO, except for the "gesture americans do to mimic italian"
Hey there
So, you guy are, liKe bRaZiliAn rIgHT
Wait, serious question, how's Poland not eastern european
It's literaly at the eastern edge of the EU, you've got ukraine east of Poland, and then that's straight onto Russia
Or is it more not "culturaly" eastern european
Thank you, I didn't knew
I put ketchup on pasta and my italian flatmate filmed me doing it (with my consent) and posted in on instagram stories with a dramatic instagram sound
I hate tomato, that's why I don't use regular tomato sauce
I don't mean to be disrespectful
It confuses me too
Spanish and Portuguese are very similar tho
It's just not appropriate to speak Spanish in here
It's like trying to speak Russian in Finland
Just don't pls
It is not advisable
Sou portuguesa
Wait
Americans talking to italians in Spanish
Uf, you had me scared for a moment
As long as it's portuguese-made codfish from norway eaten in London we are alright ahah
Yeah, I meant that
You did
I was being a bit hyperbolic before, I figured codfish was just the translation for bacalhau
Yes, we are aware of fake and inferior "codfish".
That's true
Even if you get a lot of confused faces it's definitely possible to communicate
I've had a situation where I tried helping an Italian lady get a train in Portugal and our way to communicate was saying me saying words in Portuguese/Spanish and she saying words in what sounded like Italian/Spanish
As if Spanish was the middle term language between us two
This is key: portuguese people are used to tourists and the fact that they don't speak portuguese, so a lot of us so speak simple English
Yup, that's why I mentioned Russia
Well taken as the literal geographical distance from the Ural mountains then the whole EU is made up of western european countries, and Ukraine might as well be central european ahah
At any rate, that would really not say mucy about it culturally
I bet its that little retardospanish, as people that actually speak it probably would have sense that the languages are different
Yes, I wasn't trying to argue with you, I meant to emphasize a part of your comment
That's important - we never dub movies
Except movies for kids (we call those the "portuguese version") and commercials, everything that goes on tv or the movies is subbed instead
In Spain they always dub their movies
That may explain why such a large percentage of there portuguese people is comfortable with English
We were the second European country with less babies being born in the last few years, the first one being Cyprus
On average, a Portuguese woman only has 1
3 babies her entire life which in the future is going to become a big problem for our population
Who else wants a JSF reboot
Portugal also finished last in the first year participating
With 0 points
(1964)
A good curiosity about that entry it is that its name was "Oração" (Prayer) which is exactly the same name of the song that represented Serbia in their first participation ("Molitva") and they ended up winning (2007)
You might think that, but if you take that Portuguese first place, we are by far the wors team ever in Eurovison
Even when we organised the contest, we were last
We have several 0 POINTS
Olympics but better
that's exactly it
Oh I don't think it's that much of a bad thing but they expect that by 2100 portugal will only have 5 million people (half of the current population)
4-5 euros is pretty expensive for Portuguese standards
I was about 9 years old and an old black man started secreaming at me and my friends on our way to school "killers, you destroyed my country" but I guess  he was just old and demented
Brazilians are the same with us
"You destroyed my country". Saying this to the people who unwillingly fought to keep Soviet and American milícias out from their countries
Now the cold war is over and they're left with Soviet weapons and corrupt Soviet style governments
I hate it every time a former colony blames Portugal for their ills, when we tried so hard to fix the shit we did there
I agree, but he was just an old fool
I think most of Angolan, Cape Verdians Mozambique are thinking about their full corrupt government and missing the Portuguese
He ransack my country, particularly my city, and pillaged many works of art
But he also brought about the concept of conserving fish in tin cans
Let's call it a tie for Portuguese culture
I am Portuguese, my grandma is 97 and still drinks a cup of wine every meal
Maybe that is the secret
Just kidding, but the easy going life, living outside big cities and eating from the ground has direct relation with that
Live to work or work to live
To me the most important variable is how in your  culture you see food, if a physiological necessity or a social moment
Honestly, even we have a better live expectancy than England, economic differences are clearly irrelevant to the topic, atleast when comparing european countries
I think those differences you said apply to any southern/mediterranean type country when compared to the british tbh (great comment btw)
Haha no problem, i know, didnt mean to criticize :)
The concept is base on punishment of humiliation, but i don't think that it will diminish the number of speeding violations, the risk to reward racio is really not that good, at least from my perspective has law student, the risk (being caught) is low enough for insensitive the reward (speeding)
So I don't think it will work has good has a fine or prison time, I might be wrong though there's other info that i don't have (like how good are Estonian police at watching the roads and capture the people violating the speeding laws)
The annoying thing is the people speeding passes a yellow light and everybody behind must stop
Or if you are driving under the speed limit and the light turns red and you must stop
I went to a private high school in England and we had a muck up day
Mine was pretty tame but a few years before us the graduating class bought three hamsters and painted the numbers 1, 2, and 4 on their backs before releasing them into the library
The librarians searched for hamster number 3 for hours before the kids told them what they'd done
Not a film or series, but I played recently Battlefield V and one chapter was in Norway and I found Norwegian to be a pretty cool sounding language
They suppose to be mother and daughter
Both of them have different dialects
Seems a bit of a oversight
i legitimately thought that was german or something
That makes sense
In my grandma's home village there is not many people so i greet them, but when iam in my true home, i dont greet all the people because i live in a city, i wouldnt mind, but it would be very strange for other people
Fucking Bullfighting
-The way we Portuguese drive, apparently for people outside they think we drive like we are in a rally race
-Drinking in public outside in the street
-1h or a bit more of lunch time
Owning land just for the sake of it, like people who own land don't usually plant anything (other than natural vegetation like pines, etc
) they just own it to say they own it
I know this happens a lot here, specially in the the more rural parts of Portugal
At least ours is not has cruel has the Spanish one
Still horrible tho
Fuck bullfighting
Hmm, I guess you need a good method of natural selection in order to live in the north
And while they're young, wastes less resources
I approve
Man you guys should really change your timezone
Spain, brother,... Porque
When I moved to the uk I thought this was soooo weird, that and giving me paper to clean my hands after I wash them and asking for a tip, so bizarre
T'is indeed a Mediterranean skill
I have no idea, for me it's a national shame
I believe it's only a minority (with money and power) that enjoy it
True but some other Europeans share that problem has well at least from what i hear
But true Americans have the biggest problems with drinking in the streets
Our is not total is parcial
Basically it's not punish through penal methods but instead by counter ordination
Only crimes linked to drug trafficking and selling is punish through penal methods
But in practice people rarely get a counter ordination punishment
We don't kill the bull nor hurt him, we just dodge while dancing until the bull gets tiered
Edit i explain it a bit wrong, my bad, we do hurt them but not with the same method, which is a bit less cruel but still cruel
I'm sorry
I didn't want to miss lead, it was a gap in knowledge from my part
We're one hour behind, like the UK
It gets poked with metal skewers during the horse bit and there's blood all over the bull, pretty sure that counts as hurting it
"à grande e à francesa" (big and french-like) - something incredible, glorious, epic, etc

Ver-se Grego- To feel Greek, idk the origins but it means to see yourself having dificulties in something and not neing able to acomplish something
I've heard this one but idk if it's as common, Ver à Espanhol(something like that), basically see things like a Spaniard, it's used to refer people who "see" things with their hands aka they ask to see something but go around touching instead
When someone is always punctual we say they have "English Punctuality"
"Ver à Espanhol" or "Looking at things like a Spanish" which means touching the object you're looking at
There's one in Portuguese, that refers to the French
It is used when referring something done in a big scale, fancy way or exuberant  way ( like a party or event)
"À grande e à francesa" (Big/ Large scale and French)
“Levas uma pêra que vais parar à China”. To take such a strong punch, you’d be projected across the globe
Popular expression among kids back in the 90’s
Same in Portuguese
Dude, cheer up
In portuguese, "Espanholada" means titty-fuck
We have the Trojan Horse reference as well in Portuguese
"Trojan Gift" is sort like a poisoned gift
We also have "pernas à chinês" (legs like the Chinese) - when you sit on the floor with your legs crossed
Wow
I learnt some
Very good compilation
Maybe the "relógio suíço" would mean something more like a machine that works perfectly
True
Completely forgot that one
Now that you say it, I see that you're right
I'll correct it
Thanks
Out of the loop, can someone fill me in about this guy and what's the situation exactly
Often, when a foreigner already has a thick accent and then approaches speaking brazilian portuguese
There's only so much I can unpack from there
Sometimes it's just easier to default to english, rather than having to interpret an unfamiliar accent in an unfamiliar grammar setup
At least with english, the grammar setup is always a bit more familiar
Well we Portuguese people ironically are a minority in the Lusophone world so yeah, there are some easy and hard accents
even in Portugal itself, ahem ^(São Miguel accent)
In Azores, Portugal, in the biggest island (São Miguel), they have a very specific accent that is very hard to understand to any portuguese that is not from there
I have been there twice and sometimes I would talk to locals and could not understand a word
In certain ocasions I would just give up and excuse myself for not understanding
When a journalist does interviews with people from there they normally put subtitles
It is crazy because it is portuguese but only they understand each other and portuguese people from other regions really struggle to understand it
We speak the same language
This happened to me
Trying to understand an American with an Alabama accent, trying to say "hello, how are you
" in Brazilian Portuguese was the worst
People from Madeira with a thick accent also
It took me a long time to realise that the unstereotypically short, hairy Russians I saw speaking in a museum in Ireland were just Portuguese as well
When you're not expecting Portuguese and just get the sound of it and not the words to parse, it really does sound slavic
Same in Portugal: "You will end up flipping burguers at McDonald's."
We also have some gendered versions
If you are a boy people say you will end up working in civil construction carrying buckets of cement or if you are a girl you will end up working in cleaning (physically hard jobs that pay very little)
Almost the same, mcdonald’s or supermarket (a specific one)
For us in portugal they say we will end up working at a supermarket
Cashier (caixa de supermercado) or construction (obras)
Garbage Collector, Street Cleaner, McDonalds, Supermarket cashier, "Trolha# and "Carregador de baldes de Massa" (Ciment bucket carrier) (both semi-pejorative terms for construction workers), etc
the list is long
Yup
"Se não estudas vais para as obras" was pretty much the go-to for my parents
That reminded me of that "taking an IBM" joke as a fancy way of saying you're going to work in construction
(IBM stands for "Introdução aos Baldes de Massa")
and then you kept on jamming those lovely folk songs
I have a pretty cringey t-shirt with [this] on it (translation: "you should have studied")
Anything revolving Spain like:
- when did we become independent from Spain
we existed waaay b4 Spain was even a concept
- We speak Spanish or are a part of Spain
- Chouriço and Chorizo
I've had to explain to more than one person that, yes, our tap water is safe to drink
Like, wtf
Irl never had any situationike that
Online though, a lot of Americans for some odd reason think portuguese people aren't White but "hispanic/latino" mestizo looking people and can't grasp the fact that white people can have names like Pedro or Jorge
You do have winter all year around
Dude
Earning minimum wage full time in Norway is enough to put you in the top 1% by income worldwide
You "just" need to make 32400 usd/y or about 290k nok/year or 24
200 nok/month
That's not average
Exactly
23 degrees as high temperature is what have in December where I am from
Sure
But still, GDP numbers are already adjusted for PPP and you guys are always comfortably on the top
Besides, saving rates are what really matter
You can retire anywhere in the world, but other people can rarely dream of retiring in Norway
Save 20% of what you earn, and in 4 years you'll have as much money in the bank as the average Indian can expect to earn in a lifetime
The other way around doesn't really work
Anti vaxx should be illegal do the danger it poses to vaccinated population and the population that's physically incapable to get vaccinated
Its a dangerous for the public and the community, it infringes the dignity of the human person, the fiscal integrity of the human person and the right to health and medical care something that i know both the Portuguese and German constitution and the rest of the Constitutions of Europe share in common plus the fundamental rights protected by Lisbon treatie aka the EU treatie
There are so many bad translations here that you could write a book on it but the prize has to go to:
FRANCESINHA ( a fantastic adaptation of croque monsieur, with meat, ham and a spicy sauce - one of the best sandwiches of the world) - translated literally to LITTLE FRENCH GIRL
Edit: Forgot the runner up:
Punheta de bacalhau ( raw, seasoned, codfish with onions - quite good really) - translated as Handjobs of codfish
Well, not my country, and not europe
But once in china I saw: raped chicken with beans
Didn't try it, have no idea what the original translation was
But I always wonder about the raped chicken
Also: "Paper in toilet of your own consequences" was great
you get a medal
LOL
My favourite will always be goose barnacles, which are called "percebes" in Portugal and therefore translated as "understands".
Or a type of steak called "prego" and translated as "nails"
I'm also a fan of translating "come in, come in" to "between, between", since they both translate to "entre, entre".
> translated literally to LITTLE FRENCH GIRL
It doesn't, though
It's translated to "little french" with a female grammatical gender
It would most likely be translated to "little french sandwich", since it's grammatically female as well
Makes for smaller laughs, but it's more correct
Shall I mention those fantastic " Liver baits" - Iscas de fígado
I didn’t! Just check it out
Hope the future will be better
I like that Algarve region has a balance between a party tourist destination and a nature related destination (beaches and the countryside)
You’re thinking of casinos only, Las Vegas is also known for the strip clubs I guess
To be honest, you didn't destroy Algarve
Just Albufeira
The rest of Algarve is quite fine
It's ok
People tend to overreact about the tourist problems but it's way better to have people around instead of having a ghost town
Funny enough, some people give opinions about the tourists and how they behave really bad and so on, but usually they are not even from here
I think the majority of the people from here love the tourists
But I guess not all concentrated in one city like Las Vegas . And my guess is that they’re bigger and maybe Of better quality than the ones in Europe
I don’t know
It's not hot here 22ºC but at least its sunny today
This week's weather was kinda depressing 20 to 22ºC maximum cloudy and rainy with not a lot of sun
Here we're having the coldest month of June in the last 30 years
There were a few days where the temperature reached 30ºC but the weather is mostly foggy around 20ºC around here, which is not normal here
Specially when you have a month of May very hot (around 35ºC in some places)
25ºC here
It's pleasant but not hot enough for me (for Summer atleast)
I find the weather to be perfect when I can use a t-shirt, shorts and flip-flops all day without feeling chilly
This usually happens around 30º. So for me between 28ºC and 35ºC is perfect
When the weather is above 35ºC it's not bad if you stay home
But it limits the things you can do outside so
Yeah we good
Just happy because until now we had coldish days, and we are finaly getting an actual summer climate
It's actually weird
Few last years in Portugal hot temperatures actually came earlier than this and by this time (at least in my city ) was hotter aka around  40 ºC
Tips and tricks: avoid using plastic as much as you can; avoid buying fast fashion items and focus instead on second hand clothing; eat less meat (as long as it is healthy); if you’re ordering stuff online from one website, try to order several items you want instead of one each time; shift paper napkins to cloth ones
I know this isn’t what you asked for, but it’s never enough to put it out there :D we all know this, but not a lot of people actually try to do these little efforts
Another cool thing I’ve been doing is buying food and goods in bulk; it’s way cheaper and zero plastic involved :)
This is how I deal with hot weather
- stay inside
- underwear only
- have the windows always open (unless the the sun is shining through that window, in that case close the window and pull down the shutters)
- 2L water bottle in the fridge
Last few days were very hot, but the temperature seems to have gone down slightly
The worst thing wasn't so much that it was the temperatures were high, but that the air itself was hot
I live relatively close to the sea so I'm used to there being a nice, cool breeze, but there wasn't much of that the last few days
I'm in Northern Portugal
What the hell are you guys talking about
We're having 20º maximum today, with rain
Four years ago Warsaw reached 43C around this time
I'm from Portugal and people couldn't understand why I was dying and would sit in the bathtub during the day
I discovered I sweat from places I didn't think possible
It is weird reading this as a Portuguese because sometimes (at least where I live) for a few days in Summer we have 40-45+C and that 28 to 30C temperature comes almost every week since like end of May until maximum September or beginning of October( with like only a few exceptions)
I would rather not jump into my local river, the Thames
I live in Porto, in the North
It's weird how we are almost in July and I still need a blanket to sleep
Went to the beach on the weekend but haven't had much of a chance to do so during the week
I usually drink my water at room temperature but have been keeping a lot of bottles in the fridge and freezer recently
It's uncomfortable, but I've lived through worse
Thank you though
I don't know if I count but I'm Azorean, not exactly half way around the world overseas, I feel very connected to the mainland and so does most of the people here, I'm sure there are those who are very anti mainland but those are few and far between
However, we do have a bit of a "Texas attitude", I don't so much because I'm half Azorean from another island I feel very connected and my dad's side is Northern Portuguese which I also feel very close to and grew up with people all over the country on a military base
We have developed our own traditions many of which are actually mainland ones that fell out of place over time, we're a lot more Catholic, our food is a bit different, we have a much bigger cuisine from the sea for obvious reasons and we also have more cows per capita than the mainland, I kid but I'm probably right
All in all, we're closely related to the mainland but with lots of tweaks caused by 2000km of water
I’m from Madeira
I believe we are very different from continental Portugal and I believe people often think we’re our own country - not that we dislike Portugal but madeirans really want to decide stuff for themselves which isn’t the best at times
Mainlanders from Lisbon, for example, know the meaning of words used in northern portugal but don’t know the meaning of words used in the islands
The only place in Europe that have tea plantation and volcanic islands
I'm Portuguese but never went to Azores nor Madeira but is kind of a dream because are for sure one of the most beautiful places in the world
For a lot of mainlanders, we know about Azores because of a comedian named Helfimed
It depends, A lot of words that Northern Portugal have, the Southern don't understand and vice versa
About Madeira, I think a lot of mainlanders (like myself) don't know much about Azores nor Madeira, that said, a lot of words that we don't understand
Pretty good if you have the money, we don't need much but the government sure does
Living conditions are all right but if you want choice when you go to the market for stuff in general you're better off ordering from somewhere else if you can, it's bad unless you have something very specific
If you've been to northern Portugal into a secondary hub it's very similar
I was in Barcelos months ago because of my brother and it was surprisingly similar, a lot more space but at the same time more crowded though, plenty of tall buildings, that's a big no no here
Also, the air is much better, not as pure but a lot drier
Excellent, Azores is better than Madeira
You can see the insides of some volcanoes in Terceira
Hellfimed as a very peculiar accent, from São Miguel
Other islands don't speak like that, the rest have a very legible accent
I'll just leave it at that
The central group is my favorite area of the Azores
there's tea plantations in European Russia and volcanic islands in Italy and Greece
and Azores aren't in Europe
They are islands in the middle of the ocean, they don't belong to any continent
Every island has their own thing to look forward to, mainly geography and food
I recommend the Cheeses from São Jorge, The sights and old infrastructures, dead volcanoes from the inside, the lakes of Terceira and São Miguel, climb the mountain of Pico and try their wine and cheese too, Graciosa is super tiny but they have a pastry so good it's worth a trip although you can buy them anywhere else and almost as fresh, I don't know Faial nor Corvo
There's a bunch to soak in and I won't spoil but just these few things are totally worth it
I'm in Terceira and in a really good day you can see the São Miguel on the south east side, Graciosa on the north side, and São Jorge and a bit of Pico from the west, these two line up if you ever get to drive on the fast lane (we don't have highways) on the way to Angra do Heroismo and in the sunset it's absolutely beautiful
The Central islands, Pico, São Jorge and Faial are very close to each other and it's great for a short boat trip across the channel
I'm mostly familiar with São Jorge and Terceira and biased for São Jorge because my mom's side is from there and I spend enough time to know it all but not enough that every year there's something undiscovered
You could easily spend a month on the central group and never get bored
There's also the festivities during the summer (this year is dead because of a microscopic killer beer), I can't handle crowds so it's hard for me to enjoy some of them but festivals with older people are really good, you hear a lot of gossiping, lots of old time jokes, lots of really good food
It's hard to pinpoint but the central group is a short trip away from each other so if you ever come here you can jump from one to the other if you want to explore the most
Most people have a very bare knowledge of English but it's easy to get by, a lot of stuff is written in multiple languages
DON'T start off by speaking Spanish to them, only do so in a last resort situation, it's as offensive as calling a Californian a snowflake
P.S. Make sure that your rental car has good brakes if you drive in São Jorge, it's a vertical piece of land surrounded by water, there's a lot of inclines and twists and plenty roads are 300ft above water on one side and a wall on the other
We never had issues but don't want to start now
Yes, there's plenty if you like detail
Close to my grandparents home there's the remnants of a church, just the bell tower nowadays
In 1808, a volcanic eruption sent lava down that area and according to lore it was the ceramic angels the Padre put there at the time of eruption that saved the structure
You can visit the site but can't get in
The angels are or were there, don't know if they were relocated
This is just a bit of fun history to know about the area
My late great grandma told me a late late grandparent of hers helped build the church centuries ago
Terceira has a lot of great stuff too and a lot of interesting history surrounding battles against Spaniards and the french and even the monarchs and republicans
If you give context to it, I guess not
But we live in a age of outrage, so I might be wrong
Anyhow, I am interested
Probably a blog
Edit: you can always have a blog and create a sub, of course
You could create a sub reddit and use bots and moderator to delete any political or hurtful comments
I would be interested in reading it
I second this, would love to read the diary
In the 17th century, father António Vieira said of the Portuguese "Para nascer, Portugal: para morrer, o mundo," (To be born in, Portugal; to die, the world), in a clear allusion to the adventurous spirit of the Renaissance Portuguese, that seems to echo the modern migrant Portuguese
In other countries you see some people with books
In Moscow subway train almost every one had a book
I visited Moscow a long time ago, right after perestroika
Probably
I carry my book on my phone, now
Maybe they do the same
Seixal, especifically [ bairro 6 de maio ] Hands down, the most ugly city (part of it) in Europe
Brutalist architecture can be very beautiful
Something about the honesty of its design
As far as i can tell from the skyline, thats just bad and generic construction, barely architecture
Unconventional answer but I kind of agree
Tourist hotels and apartments look god awful
And I hate the way a lot of holiday villas look
They try and go far a "rustic" look but they just look so tacky and lifeless
Radom should win an award for all things ugly
I think the answer to that is Universal Healthcare edit: typo

Neat, I didn't know we had a translated version
Gay ones
Yeah, I'm glad you had fun, but I'm sure locals weren't very pleased with your behavior
It's not a matter of being offended by fun (and jesus, where in my comment was I so unpolite to warrant a "get fucked"?), but often tourists come to a place and forget that those places are supposed to be livable places for locals and that there are certain rules to follow
I'm obviously very aware that the user I replied to didn't mean any harm and, sure, the journey was short and probably at decent hours, but the issue is that in those touristic places, that sort of behavior is amplified and repeated by a lot and while one person misbehaving is not an issue, 100, 1 000 or 10 000 people doing that definitely is
A lot of tourists get drunk, make noise late at night and trash the places and they don't get to reap the consequences of those actions
They're not the ones who have to clean up the day after or need to have had a good night's sleep because they need to work the next day
What I'm saying is that it's possible to have fun and still not being a dick to locals
[This would be my choice to represent Portugal]
Manuel Pinho, former Minister of the Economy about 10 years ago
[Here's the story, the specific don't matter much
It does indeed
I love this photo
Seems to be in the middle of Lisbon, with manly shirtless men and typical portuguese "desenrrascanço". I can't find a good translation for this word (it means something like "halfass a way to make things work") but I feel this photo really is a good illustration of it
I honestly have never seen it in person, so I can't really say
Either way, we are not a Mediterranean nation :)
That works, but I think the english term implies a sort of dignity that I don't think our term envokes
More of a Romance language than anything
The Azores, which holds the most disenfranchised spots in the country, namely rabo-de-peixe
Being disenfranchised is not at all something I would feel sorry for the Azores for
If anything I would say it's the other way around, the Azores feel sorry for us for how media and turist centered the mainland is
Portugal did join the allies and fought in WWI
But most people outside of Portugal don't know this because the participation was not very big, just a couple of battles, with the battle of La Lys
There was also some German attacks in the borders of Angola and Mozambique, that were Portuguese territory at the time
Not really an event, but when the Knights Templars were being prosecuted and hunted down, our King Dinis proclaimed that Portugal would be a safe haven for any knights who wished to come
The knights changed their name to "Order of Christ" and thought they were disbanded for a few decades, the Order is the only living successor of the Templars
I could say almost everything
Portuguese history is not very well known outside Portugal besides the period of discoveries
The 1828-1834 Civil War, also known as the Liberal Wars
My city (Porto) was under siege for 13 grueling months and it's such an integral part of our identity
25th of April
It was the day when our dictatorship was taken down
Idk much about it, but if some can explain I'd appreciate it
Just one thing, Hitler wanted Franco’s help, but Franco was the one who refused
We may forget the war but we'll never forget the Baker
Good old times, when a little army of 6
6K Portuguese in a *Táctica do Quadrado* and a *Padeira* defeated 31K Castilians
I doubt more than 1% of portuguese know about the battle of Almansa or Toro so there's that
Each state creates it's own national mythological narrative
>90% of the time when I say that I'm from Slovakia the immediate response is "ah, czechoslovakia
There's this number thrown around here in Portugal that 60% of americans think Portugal is part of Spain, which is problably the most offensive thing you can say to a Portuguese
So don't worry about it
Ignorance is not distaste or disliking one's culture, it's just ignorance
I mean there's a saying involving Almansa but I agree with your point
Yes and they (and I think colonial troops) weren't allowed to parade the Champs Elysée with De Gaulle
The reverse question: *what is illegal but doesn’t feel like it*
And the answer is peeing in the ocean
Drugs, widely and successfully legalized, nevertheless highly frowned upon
Always felr awkward using a big Lidl bag in another supermarket
Yeah the least you could do is buy the cheapest thing available
Excuse me
Can I have the law number
asking for a friend
They're still illegal in Portugal, just decriminalized
I will report you to the police
Buy GME
There are several regulamentos municipais in a number of localities, that forbid public urination
[sources] [source] [source]
I couldn't find a single one that mentioned the ocean specifically
I did find a few foreign websites that claim that we have this law, but they didn't cite any sources and appeared to be quite lacking in credibility
Probably to help the environment¿
Sure, but you're not getting arrested for consumption
I still do, I don't get what people like about beer
Now whiskey, that's good shit
The word "Saudade" only exists in Portuguese
Feeling of longing and missing something/someone
“Saudade” is a untranslatable Portuguese term that refers to the melancholic longing or yearning
A recurring theme in Portuguese and Brazilian literature, “saudade”refers to a sense of loneliness and incompleteness
The word "saudade", which means to miss someone, but in portuguese it takes the form of a common name and not a verb
Portuguese has "dígrafos" which are like your "CH" letter
Examples are: CH, LH, NH, QU, GU, RR,....
I’ve always been fascinated by Czech because of that
Czech literature (especially poetry) must be very interesting
Ye, we also have the verb to "Desenrascar" or the proper Portuguese way of saying it "Desenmerdate" which roughly translate to "unshit yourself" which means to deal with the hand you're given
Example if you don't have the a screwdriver or a knife, use a pen glued to monopoly piece so that you can use it to unscrew a screw yk
The myth that gets spread is that the word "saudade" doesn't have a translation in any other language, but that is blatantly false
It just doesn't have a ***direct*** translation to ***English***, and even then it's just a case of English having a plethora of words that are more context-specific, while "saudade" encompasses all those meanings (longing, yearning, nostalgia, homesickness
Most other languages do have a word for it
Really
I suppose you don’t have you’re welcome either
Those contractions are not exclusive to galician
We also have them in portuguese
We have that too in Portuguese, -inho/-inha or sometimes -ito/-ita
And we can use it with adjectives too, not just nouns
Well, there's the Portuguese Fado that focuses a lot on the feeling of "saudade"
In Portuguese "dor" is pain, is it related
I think the closest translation to English of тоска is melancholy, which is a feeling more associated with nostalgia than saudade
Saudade is much more intense, even though the Portuguese use it quite often to describe missing something
Edit: I mean much more intense than nostalgia*
Summer Time, without a doubt
More sun in the evening is great
I would prefer it if they just left it as it is
If it must go to a single time all year round it should be winter time because it's closer to the actual "sun time"
Murder it
Murder it
It is an aberration
Only the stupidest, most idiotic people could have suggested this shit instead of moving the time at which stuff starts; if you want to move it
It is unnatural and should be murdered with no remorse
Summer time as i prefer less light in the morning and more daytime at later hours
Summer time
Period
The early evenings really hit me hard and I hate it
Winter time definitely
Summer time is awful because when you wake up is still night and then you have sun until like 10 pm, which feels really unnatural
Winter time definitely
Leaving work or school at night hurts your mental
As long as they stop the twice a year jumps, any will do
I hate these changes, and sometimes they really hit my sleep
I would prefer the winter time, it is closer, but still 40 minutes ahead of the solar time where I live
Also makes it easier to enjoy or use early mornings
Either
I just want to stick to one time
Every time change I feel groogy and have headaches for a week
I'd like for Portugal to keep summer time and Spain keep winter time
It would get rid of that ridiculously late solar noon in the summer in Galicia and put us in the same time zone
that long
I usually only notice the difference on the following monday
i.e. Today
This, and move the office hours up/down if need be
I like the base GMT is neat to calculate other timezones
I know it's not much, but in winter the sun here sets at 17h20 or so
When I leave at 18h is already dark
Although it's not much, but I would appreciate if the sun set at 18h20 instead
In Portugal I definitely want GMT+1 forever
I think most of the Portuguese people do to
For me it's an all week
I have a week long headache
Portugal ranks #3 in the Global Peace Index
#2 in Europe and #1 in the European Union (it goes, Iceland, New Zealend and Portugal)
It also feels that way too
In here, you won't get arrested if you consume drugs, you get treated and reinserted into society
You get, however, arrested for facilitating drug acess
Our revolution to democracy was mostly non violent
(There was only like 3 deaths)
All the rest went pretty peacefully
Not to mention it was literally flower themed (red carnations)
I would say Portugal beat you by a year :)
> [They] were granted n-word pass from Haiti president
The WHO was not involved
That is wholesome
One thing that pisses me off here is that I still know a lot of people who go out of their way to buy purebred dogs (usually German Shepherds, Jack Russels and Beagles)
The London
Paris  but with all the chavs mafia eastern Europeans
The [Santa Justa Lift] in Lisbon
It's just a lift
Okay it's actually quite pretty, but I really don't get the queues of people trying to get in
A lot of downtown Lisbon is becoming a tourist trap I feel, at least that's the impression I get these days compared to when I lived there
In Edinburgh there are a lot of tacky tourist-focused shops near the castle
They sell stereotypical Scottish souvenirs and merchandise and have really obnoxious bagpipe music playing on shitty speakers
Pastéis de Belém. They sell pasteis the nata near the Jerónimos convent in Lisbon, it's a very touristy area
However most of the tourists don't know that they don't need to be in line outside for hours, they can just go in sit and have table service, the place has massive sitting areas inside
Adding to this, pastéis de Belém sell really nice pastéis de nata but they are small and expensive, there are other places in the city with same quality if not better
The city of Albufeira on the Algarve region
It's a really bleak city
Only houses and resorts, crowded beaches and stupidly high prices
It's what we call a tourist money grinder
If you are visiting the Algarve, don't go only to the places everyone goes (Albufeira, Portimão, Vila Moura)
There's an entire beautiful region to explore: the historic cities of Silves, Tavira and Olhão, the Fortress of Sagres, the historic villages of Vila do Bispo, Aljezur and Castro Marim, the pombaline city of Vila Real and the nature of Costa Vicentina and the Espinhaço de Cão, Monchique and Caldeirão Mountains
And I'm not even talking about the paradise that is the Ria Formosa
It is literally called the portuguese Maldives, with Cristal clear waters and white sand
And the best of all: no tourist crowds and super affordable prices
The best tip to have an amazing time on the Algarve is: don't visit only the famous places
Yes they are beautiful, but there's so much more waiting to be seen
Edit: typos
The [Padrão dos Descobrimentos ] although it is a good homage to the Age of the Discoveries, there is really no point in going up on top
There's also some people in Lisbon who will approach you to try to sell you marijuana, but it is mostly fake
When I went there it was during Winter and not too crowded fortunately
The hotel where I stayed nearby was also great and had the best breakfast buffet I've ever seen
I ate so many different types of bread
I went there an year ago in May and didn't find too crowded
Absolutely loved the city but did experience people selling me shit all the time near the Eiffel Tower  and a man tried to forcely give a bracelet to my girlfriend (I looked extremely mad and he left us alone)
Still, the nicest place I've been at and I didn't think it was that expensive, as long as I didn't order beverage and just drank the free water
Os pastéis de nata em Lisboa são bastante inferiores
Agreed
Went there 2 years ago
Loved Romania, Bran castle was definitely the least favourite part
I lived two months in The Hague but ended up only going to Amsterdam one day (to visit Van Gogh's, Heineken Experience, Adam's Lookout and the red light district)
I don't know if it's because I didn't really go to where I should have gone but the city honestly felt so underwhelming when comparing it to The Hague or Delft
Did I miss something
I’m Portuguese but from madeira and everytime I see padrão dos descobrimentos I’m blown away
It’s beautiful
At least there's a Wagamama nearby
What about the self proclaimed republic in Vilnius, Uzupis
When I was there kinda felt like a tourist trap
Haha I can sort of agree
Back when I was writing my dissertation last Summer I was glad I lived just outside the Fringe's limits
Had to get some things done in the city center before I left at the beginning of September and it was absolute hell
Yeah, it's a thing in some areas of Lisbon
They target turists, it's all fake drugs
Check:
It's not pricey for Portuguese standards, it's just that you get pretty much the same quality and bigger for the same prices in other places
And they are always warm also, like Manteigaria
How long is a block
Como assim
A parte de fora
Mas não vale a pena subir
(Talvez não fui claro no comentário :/)
Yeah, it's usually just parsley or oregano
Oh my, I was there
Os pasteis de nata que se vendem em Lisboa são overrated e overpriced
Tornaram se um bocado como os éclaires do Porto
Há sítios em Lisboa onde não são assim tão caros
I am an introvert and don't like football
However I have beard and eat bacalhau
Physically no, I'm tall, blonde hair, green eyes with fair skin, I do get a great tan tho and I do have a beard
I love village parties, love pimba, love talking with people, drink more coffee than I drink water, love beer and wine, like parties, love the Santo António party, but I do not love football but I watch some games and get into the spirit and sing my heart out our nation anthem
So I think I fit some cliches
Edit: forgot the most important thing, my name is Zé
Is having a beard a Portuguese stereotype
Oh god, the football
I have the sense that it used to be worse though
Maybe I just managed to gradually get away from the football-o-sphere
The football tho
If you like bacalhau and at least are able to choose a football team to preferer, even if you don't like football and have no particular reason to choose, you can get the pass for weird portuguese
I know right
Team bacalhau
It is a portuguese stereotype in Brasil to have a mustache
Basically looking like Quim Barreiros
I don't know I think it looks cool and I am too lazy to shave everyday
I sleep and eat at somewhat decent hours so I am not at your side of the border
Worse
Put the tv on after a game
10 channels analysing frame by frame every play in a game
Bacalhau for the win
༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ
Ah yeah, but that I just never see
I said that it seemed worse because growing up every adult seemed to want to make conversation about football + almost everyone my age talked constantly about it
As I tried to cut the conversation short, even at 15/16 (+/- 2008) it just bread amazement, and more questions as how I did not care
Now, I barely ever get anyone pushing football down my throat
I don't watch much tv besides the evening news, and normally turn it off as soon as football comes on (the last, more fluff, part)
I'd say the best part of football now is going grocery shopping when a big game is on
Streets and crowded places with Porto vs Benfica on are the best
And it barely ever seeps into conversation
Edit: one exception is my ukranian father in law
He doesn't speak english that well, really likes football, and doesn't know that much about PT
So he always asks how is Cristiano, and what I thought about his last game, to try and connect
The rare occasion I'll look at a game is before meeting him to be able to make conversation because he's a great guy
I didn't find a bacalhau, so you get the flag badge
Good job caralho
In Portugal bacalhau eats bacalhau
I think a lot of depictions of Europe in Hollywood movies fall into the trap of presenting it as either romanticized or backwater
There's a large amount of historical architecture over here, which I think has lead to the perception that we're stuck in the past
Not many portrayals of Portugal come to mind, but I do remember the Portuguese fishermen from Family Guy speaking with Brazilian accents
Also there was a trailer that released not too long ago for a French film called Opération Portugal which depicts immigrants and people of Portuguese descent very unfavourably
As in they're stupid and old-fashioned, but as it turns out have a heart of gold
Then again this seems to be the case with a lot of films/shows/stories depicting immigrant communities
In Love Actually the Portuguese are portrayed as a bunch of poor simpletons
Pretty much all of them
We're lucky if we get someone that doesn't speak with some kind of  Brazilian accent
Hell, even movies with actual Portuguese actors in them show us like some backward, third-world country/society (I'm looking at you, Love Actually
Fortunately we are part of Spain in Hollywood's POV, so we are spared by the Spanish stereotypes across the border
either that or we get represented as Brazilians with European seasoning
You thought that was bad
The episode where they visit Lisbon shows a BULLFIGHTING FESTIVAL WHERE THE BULLS RUN ON THE STREETS
Where did they get that idea from
We have bullfighting yes, but bulls DO NOT run on Lisbon's streets
It's my grandmother's favourite movie
She watches it religiously every christmas
Yeah conflating Portugal with Spain is incredibly cringey
Honestly I just wish these big productions would actually put some effort in their research and depiction of places
I get that maybe the average viewer they have in mind won't really care, but it's not that hard
They should at least try and get the accents and languages right
Ò yé, butchi ai schtili cán gô fó uóqueis im da junguel
And so on and so on
There is an accent for every language
I once saw a poster outdide of a Lidl that said "don't swap our babies". It also said to look into their Facebook page for more information and so I did
Turns out there are people out there who belieber the governament is swaping people's babies in hospitals in order to make them more acceptant of their power ir something
>Columbus
That's ridiculous
Everyone knows Columbus was a Portuguese spy born in Cuba, Alentejo, that tried to fool the Spanish king, accidentally discovering America
Copernicus ends with a S.
S is next to A in the QWERTY keyboard
Obviously, they accidently swapped the A in the end with the S at birth and weren't allowed to switch by the church since God snitched on them that he was gonna be a big bad heliocentrist
They added a U before the S, which the church allowed only because Copernics sounds weird and heretical
In the Latin world, names that end with an A are almost always( if not always) female
Copernica was a woman, obviously
Erasmus orgies, my friend
Neither, as I always write in uppercase
But If I had to write in lowercase, it would be "α". We learn cursive in school so I think the vast majority of people would write it like that as well
I mean carolingian miniscule was written by hand and that featured the "a". A lot of blackletter scripts as well
It's certainly time consuming however
People sometimes joke about uniting with the region of Galicia in northern Spain, which has historical and linguistic connections to Portugal, and as far as I know Galicians joke about this too
It's usually pictured as a friendly union rather than a conquest, but it's kind of at the expense of Spain
There's really frequent jokes involving a rivalry with Spain and defeating them in battle, which is kind of a recurring and somewhat romanticised event throughout Portuguese history
Now there's also this whole thing about Olivença which turned into a bit of an internet meme in recent years
This is a town which Spain conquered during the Napoleonic wars but is still officially claimed by Portugal
I feel like it used to be sort of a "fun fact" kind of thing but I think all the references to it in internet culture have made some people take it kind of seriously
There's also these dumb "Angola is ours" memes where you can't tell anymore if people are mocking the fascist regime in a tongue in cheek way or actually showing sympathy towards it
Feels like the former is turning a bit into the latter as time goes by and as some far right political opinions are starting to take hold in Portugal
In Portugal  we say that Olivença (in Spain that should be ours) is ours and there’s also a few people that want to get Galiza part of us (they probably want it to ngl)
As a portuguese, so many
Olivenza comes first to mind, Galicia (even though is not a reconquest but we kind of see them as close brothers), the parts the UK took at the Pink Map Ultimatum and basicly every former colony
And sometimes we joke about conquering the world and bringing the Fifth Empire to life
Really
Hahaha xD
I think in general we are selective, we just vote for one that we like
About commenting depends, some probably say to eat some tapas or to give Olivença back xD
Olivença é nossa
Give it back
( we'll also gladly accept our brothers and sisters from Galiza, but that is not rightfully ours)
Loool good luck
The Olivença thing is so overused and annoying tho
Like half the time you see a Spanish flair here there has to be some comedic genius replying "give back Olivença", it's so cringy
It's a small and insignificant town, who cares
Padeira de Aljubarrota has entered the chat
And the punchline is something like - " It seemed a good idea
how did it fail again
You tried a handful of times, ruled for 60 years, but not because you conquered us, and we fought back, just give up
, the Portuguese cannot be conquered
And Angola too ( also as a joke)
Olivença is definitely our answer to this question
For example:
Although, it's just for laughs really
I don't think anyone really cares
It's actually part of an euroregion now
(Source in wiki:
It's more like an internet meme, Portuguese people don't really care about Olivença a small town full of old people in Alentejo and the spanish also dont care about Olivenza a small town in full of old people in Extremadura
But if you give, but we won't say no
I notice that too
Olivença,  caralho
Yes  like I’ve heard many people say that the capital of Angola is Lisbon
coitados
Olivença you mean
You can keep her
But we start to make plans to reclaim Galiza, every time Spain football selection/a Spanish football team eliminate us from a international  football competition
Maybe some (cultural) blitzkrieg will change their minds
Coitados  o quê, Angola è nossa
(Sarcasmo)
Actually no
This part about olivença is because there is a real dispute between Portugal and Spain for the region
We also joke about Angola because there is a song, called "Angola é nossa
", angola is ours, that was created during the colonial war in the 70's, when Portugal was still ruled by the Dictator António Oliveira Salazar and the Portuguese colonies in Africa were trying to gain independence
That song, that is a patriotic song about Angola being Portuguese and that the Portuguese will never lose in combat and will keep the colonies, was recently turned into a meme
The other colonies did have anything to joke about, specially Macau, that was offered to the Chinese by Portugal very recently, in 1999, and willingly
Not worth the trouble
How is Gibraltar situation now, with the UK leaving the EU
You have a deal from my part
I only know abput it because of reddit
Not at all
Nope, nothing at all
Tipping, is just mind blowing how the employees depend on it, especially in restaurants
Metal detectors in schools
I know **why** they have them, but it will never not be crazy to me
Politics in the US are not confusing
There's plenty of available movies and documentaries about politics in the US, I'd say they're the most common
The only thing confusing thing is that you have crazy religious sects with aberrhant beliefs and then New York City and California, all in the same country
I always thought that wouldn't it be easier to control drunk driving if both the driving age and drinking age were 18
As it stands Americans can start driving very soon and getting a hold of alcohol before you can legally drink it isn't the hardest thing in the world
Meanwhile driving a car illegally seems a lot harder to pull off
I don't know, it just seems to me that it's easier to break the law by drinking when you're legally not allowed to versus driving when you're legally not allowed to, therefore increasing the driving age would prevent more cases of drunk driving
If I had a dollar for each time an American asked me "are Portuguese white or Latino
Tbf we do that too
Reminds me of the see-through backpacks idea that was spread around
I'm assuming that never really became a thing, did it
15 days for marriage ( no limit to number of marriages lol)
15 days a year for assistance to children
5 days for death of children, partner, parents, or in parents in law
2 days for grandparents, grandchildren, siblings or siblings in law
5 days for the birth of a child
Every absense due to school exams or court appearences
Any absence made by union representatives made to attend to union matters
Any absence made by a candidate to an election on the 15 days prior to the elections
Unlimited days for disease
All of these require proof of motive for absence
here you get the hours you need to donate off, not the all day
Caralho, is this for real
I had no idea and I live here xD
Paid leave for disease
Is this really like this
I understand if it is an work accident it can be paid but for a general disease I doubt it
Yep
My employer also gives us our birthday
First three days you don't get paid
Afterwards you get 55% to 75% according to
the number of days on sick leave
Same, but it's not very common
Are you getting those views from HLTV
Org
This might be biased cause I live here
But Tomar, Portugal is in my opinion still hidden a hidden gem, just 1 hour and half train ride from Lisbon
Apart from a major religious festival every 4 years, which attracts around 600k people  (if you are curious it's called " festa dos tabuleiros"), we are mostly hidden from the world
We have one of the oldest churches and one of the oldest synagogues in Portugal and also one of the biggest castles in Portugal,
Apart from the monuments it's a rather small town with quite old architecture, because it's so small you really don't need any transports
Food is inexpensive but rather good
I'm not really good at reviews tho and Im definitely not making it justice but if you take a look at my post history I have a couple of photos of it (sorry for the self promo)
Cáceres in Extremadura right
Went there on a school trip once and the museum was dope
Also Aracena in Andalusía is pretty and has cool caverns
I've noticed Dundee gets a lot of shit from people in Scotland
Ok not really shit, but a lot of people tend to describe it as boring
I've never spent that much time there but it looked pleasant enough
I also thought the V&A was cool
And apparently it's becoming a tech and gaming hub
In Portuguese the word for ass, cu, is pronounced the same way as the French word for neck, cou
Also the Portuguese word for dick, pila, can mean battery in Spanish
A lot of people think that the japanese word "Arigato" is related to the portuguese word "Obrigado" both meaning "thank you". However, this has been proven to be false
Found out the other day that the Irish Gaelic word for the stress sign is _fada_ (this in on itself means "fairy" in Portuguese)
The thing here is that they pronounce it as _fóda_, from what I gathered
_foder_ means "to fuck" in Portuguese, and _uma foda_ is something like "a fuck", one sexual intercourse, that is
It's kind of childish, I know, but I found this out the other day from an Irish guy named Seán, saying that is name was written "S, E, A fóda, N". It got me, the Irish guy and other Portuguese pals to finally understand that he was indeed talking about the stress and not about fucking the letter A.
We called it "fake friends", for Portuguese - Spanish one could make almost a book full of them
Some examples:Aceite (oil) -  Aceite (accept)
Embarazada (pregnant) -  Envergonhada/embaraçada (embarrassed)
Vaso (Cup/glass) - Vaso (Vase)  // (or even toilet in Brazillain ahah)
We also have puxe ( pull), which sounds like push in English
It's funny watching some people pushing doors instead of pulling
In Portuguese we write Caca but it's just the same shit
Well, there are literally dozens of japanese words with Portuguese origin
Check the list here:
Obrigado and arigato, both meaning "thank you".
Even worst
Borracho in Portuguese from Portugal may mean drunkard also, a species of bird and an handsome man

Regarding news I would say it's a normal amount of brazilian info
Maybe once a day
And usually it's things related to politics, like Bolsonaro doing something stupid or a protest
However, we are basically bombarded with brazilian soap operas
Every big generalist channel with the exception of RTP pass at least two brazilian soap operas after the night news
There's also a lot of brazilian music here, and most games are dubbed or subtitled in brazilian portuguese, which can be a bit uncanny for the average european portuguese speaker
And let's not start talking about the internet
Everything is from Brazil
Search for a recipe
Brazilian version
Searching about a law or regulation
It's gonna be the brazilian one
Searching about a translation for a word or phrase
It's gonna be in brazilian portuguese
The overwhelming doesn't come from news, but the rest of the media and info
Edit: typos
In Portugal we make an effort to remain connected to the rest of the Portuguese speaking world
We make cultural events, have their TV channels, etc
So it's not wonder that stuff happening in those countries always makes headlines
I think the Portuguese do worry about those countries
In the mind of most Portuguese people, they're also Portuguese
But it feels weird in the sense that we the Portuguese feel connected to Brazil (for example) but the majority of Brazilians know little about Portugal
Yeah, we should be able to filter out certain regions when doing a search
"-br" is your search friend
If you use Google, use "www
google
pt" instead of the default
You will be able to restrict results to "Portugal" from "Ferramentas". Not perfect but acceptable
At least on PC
and with Chrome
And to simply exclude a domain, add "**-**site:com
br" (in the case of Brazillian websites)
In Portugal, once someone said: To born, Portugal, to die, the world
I like the idea of living across multiple countries in Europe, and speaking the local language would allow me to do what I like the most: learn how the locals think
More recently, I would like to live in Iceland to experience their culture
In that case I would have to bring the sun with me
Either Germany  or Norway
Maybe not as prosperous as some northern European countries, but I would love to live in Italy
I probably have a narrow minded view of the country, but seems to be rich both culture and cuisine, and is generally quite beautiful
Probably Sweden
Maybe Italy or Germany, but admittedly I still perfer Portugal no place can't replace home
I am from Portugal
Speak English and German, can handle myself with spanish and Italian
Loved living in Germany and will visit as often as i can
I will never live anywhere else except Portugal
With all it's faults, i really love it here
Italy
Or Denmark
Also Netherlands, I lived in the Netherlands for a little bit but it gets impossible to meet people and consistently hang out unless you speak Dutch
Spain definitely, probably in Barcelona, but my second choice would be Italy
I’m Portuguese btw
Stay the fuxk away from (in summer) portugal one time I was visiting my dad their and had to stay overnight in a bus station cus of some transportation issues wake up to see my hand swollen as fuk I got bit my so many by mosquitos or whatever
Same boat
You forgot Portugal
On the upside, you live in a gorgeous country
Been there twice and can't wait to go back
What was your "they didn't realize I spoke the language" experience
Back in 2012, I went to visit my cousin in the UK along with my brother and other cousins
We were drinking a cup of coffee when a elderly woman sat in the table next to us, stared at us and said, rather loudly:
"These Russians are everywhere nowadays
We looked at each other in shock and then my brother turned to her, smiled and said:
"Actually were Portuguese, ma'am
The look on her face was priceless
Have you ever experienced something similar
Yes, in Poland a few years back
I mus say that my actions were fuelled by that arrogance you get when you think no one around you understands what you’re saying in your native language so you use and abuse it
I was with a couple of friends in line to buy cigarettes and we were talking in Portuguese
There’s this dude behind us that keeps eyeing us the all time
So I as arrogant as I can be say in Portuguese “What are you looking at
To what he responds also in Portuguese “I’m looking at you
” Awkward silence after that and then we ended up laughing about it
It was really embarrassing and taught me a valuable lesson
I don't have any funny stories
I just wanted to say that I expected that 1 in 3 responses to this thread were to be portuguese people
The OP is portuguese and the second most upvoted comment is from a portuguese
There tugas everywhere, EVERYWHERE
One time on a bus in Belgium this guy enters, having a phone call, very loudly and clearly describing his sexual exploits from the previous night with another man in portuguese
Couldn't help chuckling but I didn't say anything
He was probably another Portuguese person and was curious about you guys
Amigo tuga, já partilhei a tua estória no nosso estimado sub r/Portugal  !
She was speaking English, but we were speaking in Portuguese
I guess she thought we didn't speak English, the older generations don't in Portugal because back then they only learned French in School, but nowaday kids start learning it very early here
Not that she would know that, but if it had been my parents in that coffee house they wouldn't understand her
Are you pale-skinned and light-eyed
That's how I got mistaken for French several times in my country too
My friend and I had one too
In London, she was telling how hot the bartender was and that he had a nice ass
Turned out he was Brazilian and understood everything she said
She was so embarassed that we went back to our hotel
Yes and in hindsight my comment was really distasteful, thankfully we were able to laugh it out
I was young and stupid, but I’ve learned my lesson
I work a lot with tourists (I have a street food business in the local farmers market) and this week a family of Americans turned up and were discussing amongst themselves about who was going to order (I guess they thought I didn’t speak English)
The wife takes one look at me (I must have been smiling or something) and says to her family “I think she can understand us
”. I said that I understood them completely, to what they answer “Well, it’s a good thing that we weren’t talking smack about you then
Obrigada pela atenção caro compatriota
Felizmente o crescimento não se faz só para cima e para os lados e este caso foi um abre olhos para mim
It was
Luckily we ended up laughing about it
Looking back it was a distasteful thing to say
Join the recessive trait club, hermano ;)
No porno scenario in this case, I'm afraid
He stayed working, we went back to our hotel room and slept
Nice story though
My friend got married last april and her husband thought it was hilarious
This is Spanish
My parents have one and it's my favourite
I thought it was only a stylishly designed deck they found in a shop somewhere
I had no ideia there were different nationalities of decks and the most common was french
(just found out there is a Portuguese as well but very rare)
My experience in Portugal is that it is popular in some regions and others not
I remember people playing with it regularly in Trás os Montes, near Spain, and it was common
In Lisbon almost no one uses it and they found it very weird that I had it
In Portugal we use the French one but we call the types of card(nipes) ouros, espadas, copas and paus wich it looks like correspond to Spanish deck
I find this very interesting
Personally I have only seen french decks, there was a time I thought they were THE deck and there was no other deck
I live right beside you and I have NEVER seen such cards ever in my life
I never knew these existed, but TIL that our names for the suits are completely different from the images because of the Spanish deck
I never even thought about it
From Wikipedia:
> In Portuguese, the Hearts suit is called Copas ("cups"), the Spades suit is called Espadas ("swords"), the Diamonds suit is called Ouros ("gold coins"), and the Clubs suit is called Paus ("clubs" or "sticks")
You guys are our neighbors, and I swear I never saw those cards before
Cool post OP, brought me a lot of childhood memories, because those were super popular in here until the late 1990s. Now I don’t think they are, but also you don’t see many people playing cards in cafés or tascas
Yep, I also have one that looks exactly like that picture
It seems to be a miniature, though, as the cards are *tiny*.
Those were quite common until the late 1990s, when I was a kid a lot of people played with them, some actually prefer them to other decks
This already exists
Is it not the case in France
Most definitely
A lot of older people keep on driving up until the 70s-80s and are stubborn about it
It's dangerous
A BIG yes
A yearly test should be mandatory
My mom and I once had a car accident, because of an elder man whose vision was strongly debilitated
He was driving at 9 pm, and we had a head-on collision, as he was driving in our side of the road
Unfortunately, some doctors in Portugal do not seem to care enough to revoke driver licenses of elders that might not be able to continue driving safely, especially in smaller urban areas
We have laws that require a medical test after a certain advance age, if I'm not mistaken , I'm not sure about the age tho probably 65 or 70 years
Yes, and I cannot stress this enough
A few months ago, an elder man was tired of waiting for the railroad crossings to open and just passed by them
Needless to say, the train hit the car, killing not only him but his wife and their 10-12 year old granddaughter
Some old people can be stubborn and don't understand the notion of safety when it's told to them
Depends on the person, really
I have a friend who insists on wearing a T-shirt in the middle of winter
Personally, I'd say around 15-10ºC is the temperature at which I might want to grab a nice jacket
I'm really cold with 18°C weather
I'm going to Czech Republic for the winter
May die
Wish me luck
It depends on a lot of factors
A cold dry sunny day, -5/-10 is tolerable with the appropriate clothing
An overcast, windy and rainy day at 10 can be miserable even with appropriate clothing
It depends on wind, and it depends on predictions
I am in Lisbon, by the coast, and it is windy and you just know wind will pick up at sunset often and shady places might be windy
So this time of the year, if you are leaving home in the morning but returning later, you know you might be getting some wonderful hours at around 24 early afternoon but bits where it might be 13 and windy around 7-8pm
You bring a jacket, or hoodie or something
If the wind is strong even temps of 17-18, you want more than just a tshirt, even a long sleeved one
18°C. I don't like cold
It's a good thing that I live in a warm southern country
Here in Portugal everything below 10⁰C is extremely cold for me, giving that I live on the coast
I think the lowest temperature I've seen in my city was 2-3⁰C and it was on the new year's Eve
I could not even walk in the street in that night
But never snows here, unfortunately
Portugal entered the chat
Yeah, 5C is freezing my balls cold
Same thing for me here in Portugal
At 0° C all life functions cease
I've asked the question about politicians far more than about the cold, tbh
I can't believe PiS is bringing Poland back to the Middle Ages AND people are voting for them to do it
When it is above 30°c, you're in Algarve, not in the UK
Well, it's just the same with you people from the North and the heat
Guess you melt at 40°C ?
It's not just not being used to the cold, but you're cold EVERYWHERE
Houses are ridiculously poor insulated, so in peak Winter, if there's a sunny day, I sometimes feel warmer outside than inside because the walls haven't warmed up yet
I never had that issue when I lived in Poland, I started to feel like I could freeze when temperatures fell below -15 (or -5 if there was wind)
In Portugal
I'll be freezing if temperatures drop below 15 and there's a breeze
We have some places where it reaches below zero
Doesn't mean we like it ;)
Me too
You had close to that in 2010
37,2°C at Liperi
The most we ever had was 47,3° in 2003 at Amareleja, historically the warmest place here
Europe is a big continent
You are at 37 degrees latitude, which is like Faro, Palermo, Athens
It is a whole different ball game the far north, and summer is not so nice either, the too much light, the wrongness of sun angles is weird as fuck
Sorry for the personal questions, but did you grow up at lower latitudes, is your skin color dark
It is not normal for people who grew up in say southern Portugal to get depressed with the relatively small day time variation
If your skin color is dark, or even if it is not, do consider checking your vitamin d levels, and do consider upping your consumption of foods like fatty fish, liver, eggs and try to catch some sun on exposed skin (if your skin is dark, you are a vegetarian and/or cover your skin a lot, really really check with a doctor about vitamin d supplementation)
Also try to catch sun on your exposed skin in winter
I think it does a world of good
In Portugal "ter um par grande" has the same meaning of big balls, while "por os tomates de molho" means to not do anything, in essence being lazy
In Portuguese we say "ter tomates" (literally "having tomatoes", which is slang for testicles) which means being brave
If you want to say you're bored or lazy you can say something like "estou a coçá-los" (literally means "i'm scratching them [the balls]")
Grandes bolas, hmm I’m trying to find a more figurative meaning instead of large testicles
No there isn’t.
You already have money, why would you retire in Switzerland
In Portugal you have sun, good food, good wine and football, you have all you need to spend a retirement like a boss
Sort of
I tend to vote on the party that I believe is best for the current political/economical/social situation, though in terms of ideology I probably lean more towards the left
So if I think that the country needs a majority government I'll vote accordingly even if it's not the one I agree with the most, or if I think that we need more fiscally responsible policies in that situation (like during the 2008 crisis) I may vote more center
As for European elections I always vote Green parties because I think (though I may be wrong) that a lot of the environmental regulations/laws come from Europe and so I think that having a strong green presence in the EU is probably the best way to fight climate change
The only time I voted for a party I truly believed in was in the last elections and I kind of regretted it because what they wrote in their party manifesto was not at all respected by the chosen Parliament member, it was a bit of a scandal actually, but what can you do
“Portuguese smokers correspond to 20% of the population, with men having been smoking less and less, although they are the most smokers”
it was much higher in the past and unfortunately many teenagers still smoke outside of schools but luckily in general it is decreasing
The thing that annoys us the most is thinking we are Spanish or that we speak Spanish
We are older than Spain and we have resisted invasions from other Iberian countries for centuries
Also, sometimes brazilians will ask us to "give back their stolen gold". I understand that most of the time it's a joke but I have seen cases (and even met people who came to live in Portugal) where it seemed like they were talking seriously
Like, most brazilians are descendants of colonisers anyway so you shouldn't blame us who stayed here
Also, it has been proven the gold wouldn't fix the country's problems and even if it did, you've been independent for almost 200 years (congrats on that by the way
I know you've celebrated your independence recently)
Probably when a non spanish speaking tourist comes here and says "gracias"
Try thanking us by saying " Gracias".
We will melt at your feet, appaled by your wisdom and kindness
So you're Portuguese, right
- a tourist
Yes - a Portuguese
*proceeds to hit me across the ears with broken Spanish*
oh yeah, I know some Portuguese *proceeds to slap me with amazing Brazilian Portuguese"
Even I cringed
We would never ever confuse you
Or if anything we would be "Sweden
that thing next to Norway
". Sweden has no codfish
You are way more important to us
You do not get angry
You tut
You look
You sneer a bit
Somebody might say a polite passive agressive comment
Portugal is a very particular place in which we take queueing and their fairness very seriously and we are not inhibited at all to actually get angry in mobs at queue jumpers
It is a beautiful thing
Number issuing ticket machines everywhere where people queue trying to prevent chaos from occurring
Go to the supermarket
Take a number for the fish counter, another for the meat counter, or deli counter or bread counter
I think it's confusing in Portuguese:
First due to the whole Holland thing
Second because the actual name is the same as the low countries region: "Países Baixos". Which does translate cleanly to "Low Countries".
So, to recap:
Low countries - Países baixos (region)
Netherlands - Países Baixos (country)
Holland - Holanda (Netherlands region)
> proceeds to slap me with amazing Brazilian Portuguese
Yes
Annoying AF
But, to be honest it is still the same language so at least the gringo in question does know the difference between Portuguese (of both main flavours) and Spanish (Castillan for many of our Spanish Friends), and actually bothered to learn some of it
And, let's be honest, online the vast majority of Portuguese Language content is Pt-Br (A lot of us aren't aware of it, because we are used to only browse in English), and other folks really can't be expected to understand the difference between the two variants, and if they know there are differences they probably expect them to be similar to En-US vs En-UK, which, apart from bad spelling from the US part, is pretty much identical
It's also the "So you're Spain right
" for us
We do love to queue, if we see a queue we jump right in even if we are not sure why we are queueing
We actually consider it, on a day-to-day basis a different language
Like you might say "a link but it is written in brazillian", or ask a brazillian "how do you say that in brazillian
". True
Grammar and vocabulary is very different and functionally we distinguish their language from our language
(The other former colonies no, their portuguese is close enough to ours it feels the same)
Almost 48% of the brazilians are white and 43% are "Pardos" (misture of black and white
They have tanned skin)
Which means that almost 90% of the brazilian population as european ancestry, and most of them will have colonialist ancestry
That is what I meant
To be honest, most people here don't really care about it
We mostly navigate technology and entertainment in English or with (European) Portuguese subtitles
It's infinitely more infuriating in the rare cases where you pick a Portuguese flag and see Brazilian-flavoured text, because it's perfectly understandable, but hard to ignore
I imagine it would be the same with you guys and Austria, at least if what I heard about Schwarzenegger not being allowed to do his own dubs in German
Like, if you have someone speaking medical jargon in Brazilian Portuguese, it's very hard to not hear it as Brazilian Portuguese first and medical jargon second, because it's a bit funny sounding and distracting
I think this funny-sounding thing goes both ways, though, but I suspect we bump into Brazilian Portuguese more often than they do with European Portuguese, for obvious reasons
I wouldn't say we can't understand them
We definitely can
But it's just annoying
Nothing against brazilian portuguese, of course
It's just that, for us european portuguese speakers, brazilian portuguese falls into a kind of uncanny valley
We rather read it in english :P
>which is so different that the Portuguese can't understand them
It's actually the other way around
Brazilians can't understand us
And yes, it's a bit frustrating
>Portugal originated from the kingdom of Galicia
You mean Kingdom of León, which occupied more regions than just Galicia
>Spain primarily from Castile
Spain only came to be as a country in 1516 because the other Iberian Kingdoms united with each other
But it was not the same thing as Castille
You wouldn't say the United Kingdom is the same country as the kingdom of England (927-1707)
Portugal got it's independence from the kingdom of León, but this kingdom was not united with Castille at the time
Anything past Vilar Formoso is essentially the USSR to us
Exactly
You don't act on it, we do
And like you said, it's far healthier
I've once seen a young girl skipping a queue of around 20-30 people to enter a bus
Every
single
person
that entered the bus after her stopped at her seat to berate her for it, before taking a seat of their own
I had never seen someone try harder to be swallowed by a bus seat in shame and humiliation
I'm pretty sure she never did it again
> we are closer in pretty much anything but language to (for instance) Czechs or Slovenians
how so
(genuine question)
Huge PR on our part
It was called the "Hispanic" Peninsula until Spain decided to claim that name for themselves without owning all of it
Heck, 6 or 7 centuries ago we were called "Spaniards" because the "Spaniards" included Portuguese, Castilians and Aragonese, even though we all had different crowns
Same shit with the US claiming the moniker "America" for the whole thing
Still, "Iberia" may come from the same root as "Ebro", which is a river entirely in Spain
We can understand each other mostly kind of
Asymmetrically
A lot of brazillians might not understand spoken Portuguese which is really frustrating
If they are educated then European Portuguese might resemble formal written brazillian ( there is a lot of diglossia there, the way they speak is not how they write “properly”, and obviously this exacerbates class divides)
But we also understand Spanish a bit usually, or Galician even better, or some African Portuguese derived creoles só understanding each other more or less does not usually make people feel it is the same language particularly when comprehension is not perfect and not symmetrical
I dunno, it might be like somebody speaking Ebonics and somebody from Glasgow
But the written languages are just as different, politeness modes, even grammar ( they write stuff like “you is” or “ I saw he” to give an example of how grammar is diverging)
The official policy is it is all the same language and so on, and there are individual testing and language teaching
I think official treaties, being laws are written in very formal language which will be basically PT_PT
African and Timorese Portuguese is very close to PT_PT anyway
But the way people actually speak day to day is not standardized and you can tell instantly
Apps and sites and so on are localized
> "Yeah,the oldest country on the continent
Oh Boy
This is something that really ticks you guys off, isn't it
Namely what is the oldest continuosly existing as a separate and independent country and with the same borders in Europe (Assuming you from Bulgaria, which is the only country in Europe from which that sentence could make sense)
We kind of don't care, except to tick you off, TBH
Welll, The OP (at least from the flair) isn't European either
No, I got what you mean, I really wanted examples in how your culture is closer to those countries since I know very little about the region as a whole
Maps definitions for regions are a bit arbitrary, though
America starts the "Midwest" in Illinois, and the South is really the Southeast
We're only ever Western Europe when preceded by "Worst in" so Spain or Belgium don't get the bad rep
Otherwise we're Southern
> Spain is clearly the dominate one
We're not stuck here with them, they are stuck here with us
I don't know, being an older, stabler and an established nation-state country for longer than they have (not to mention a sizeable overseas empire and influence) does give us a few points that Ireland doesn't have over Britain, hence why we managed to shoo away the "Hispania" name for the whole thing
Not having a good substitute name also hurts your position a bit, but I do get your point about not wanting to be thought of as part of a different country
I like the "St
Agnes isles" moniker, being named after the smallest rather than the largest isle
It is possible to not understand them
Some accents are really weird, some variants seem to go through a different stress phenomena which makes it sound like a whole different language, then there are pronunciations issues which trip us (MEO
No, mel
Ássenau
No, Arsenal
) things like esse means este after all, lack of pluralization ( levanta o braço! Which one
Both
This happened to me honestly in a X-ray) and just things being understandable but meaning way different things ( fecha na segunda-feira, todo ano) stuff like that
Particularly on the phone or with recent arrivals it can be a lot of “desculpe
” from my side as well
So much stuff
Chicken is not carne, for example
Parede mole
Movie and tv language is usually clearer and more dramatic
I do not see a lot of brazillian movies or tv, I think BR tv uses a neutralish kind of accent which is easier, or it tends into formal modes which are not how people on the streets talk but is closer in grammar to how normal modes
I think a portuguese novela shown in Brazil was shown with subtitles
Some "gritty" brazillian movies are shown without subtitles but they can be a bit "what" to listen to
Foreign language movies or tv series are treated differently, in Portugal they are subtitled and ocasionally animated movies and/or children's movies are dubbed locally
In Brazil they dub things very widely anyway, alway locally
Fiction books  or "soft" science stuff written natively in Portuguese usually are not adapted apart maybe from slight spelling things
But everything translated is translated separately (and it is very very difficult to find a portuguese person willing to read to a brazillian translation) and on technical things, the language can be totally wide apart in terms, usages and all
Newspapers and magazines  we do not really read or buy media in brazillian
The very formal  like BBC or Folha de São Paulo can tend to very close to PT_PT though there can be jarring things like bad collocation of pronouns (they tend to overcorrect, LOL, in some cases it has to come BEFORE) or just different vocabulary
Yes
In fact if they want to be public servants they need to do a formal language/grammar test to test their knowledge of formal grammar, even if they got school diplomas or university degrees
The "concursos". (Example, google translate this  Lots of brazillians post in r/portuguese about it, studying grammar and preparing for that
Things like pronominal collocation like "give me" in english
In English it always comes after the verb right
in PT_PT it usually comes after the verb, but there are some words, conditions (particularly negations) which push the pronoun in front, and that is the rule also in formal PT_BR
In everyday brazillian they put the pronoun in front always (me give - me dá) . And it is just school learning the rules to write or speak more "formally". Sometimes they get it wrong, hipercorrect it in that they put the pronoun AFTER the verb even when it should be in front
Things like object pronouns (the equivalent of me/you/him/her/it) in english, also mostly book learning stuff
They are far more likely to always say "Eu vi ele" (I saw he) rather than "Eu vi-o".
They also mix up a lot courtesy modes and their pronouns  and verbal tenses
I'm dumb
It's official ;)
No worries
I just misread, because the all "Bulgaria/Portugal is the oldest nation in Europe" is an old internet peeve (moreso for Bulgarians, AFAIKT), which is silly, because the only right answer is San Marino
> my language calls the Pirenees peninsula
I like that
How do you guys call it
Something like Pyreneean Peninsula
Ah, of course
It slipped my mind that the Austro-Hungarian empire was more than Austria and Hungary, and that Prague/Bratislava/Ljubljana must have been important hubs of the whole thing and not just Vienna and Budapest
It could be African influence as well, because it shows up in African dialects as well, but I think brazillians feel better about Italian influence than Angolan
I am not angry, I was just explaining the differences, why it is difference
And no I do not think it great, or beautiful ( maybe to your ears but to me things sound like “I saw he” or “you is”)
There is a kind of frustration in miscommunication don’t you think
Also maybe Brazilians are more acquainted with Portuguese grammar (though not accent or slang) because it is their formal mode, while Portuguese people can just be frustrated by stuff which just breaks the grammar logic
You might think it great and richer but to others it might look like you are randomly inserting, mixing different text fonts or randomly bolds and italics in something that is meant to convey meaning
And you are going “ so many different things, isn’t it richer
“ well, the point is communication not diversity
Tower of Babel is too much diversity
I would add even something else
Another redditor here, a brazillian is espousing "ah diversity, so cool, so interesting". But in my experience this wild diverging of regional accents and diglossia (differences between official and actual language spoken) can exarcebate social class differences, can be a kind of barrier to social mobility
In Portugal while there are regional dialects (it is getting more blurred with each generation) and class differences in extent of vocabulary or specific vocabulary, usually it is close enough and you can not actually tell much difference between say politicians  who grew tending sheep or child workers in factories or those whose parents were political elite
The language they use is the same
Ditto about dunno football players, there is not much noticeable difference between how the kid son of emigrants who grew in a shelter home and the kid of university professors or doctors speak
I am actually not making up these examples
For brazillians it is different, and it is much harder for the poorer to get a good education in formal language, particularly because the rich have this culture of paying for "extra" classes for their kids prepping them for university (Brazillian kids do not have a LOT of school hours
University is free and merit based mostly, but again the poor start off a lot worst
True
And I just want to add that we are trying all together to standardize the language:
I learned this a few months ago, that a lot of European language and Arab languages, have the word for orange derived from the name Portugal because we introduced sweet orange to a lot of places
That apparent our drug laws are rather unique
I didn't know of thst until I saw some Americans talk about Portugal on the Internet and use it as an example for drug laws
Believe it or not but such subject is not really discussed here in Portugal
In fact, I suspect most Portuguese people aren't even aware of such laws
Which makes sense since the overwhelming majority of us don't do drugs
It actually has bunkers for 110% or 120% of the population, I felt safe in Geneva in case of a nuclear strike, thanks Switzerland
Where'd you think you got pasta from
Limona sounds almost like our word for lemon ("limão")
Cool
> No
Germany's 29
2 isn't "far more" than Luxembourg's 24
8 or Austria's 21
To be fair, Luxembourg is a microstate, and Austria is basically Germany
Correlation does not imply causation
At the beaches I frequent you can find some women sunbathing topless, but I'd say it's probably around 10%. And from what I've gathered they're not necessarily Portuguese women, but foreigners
It isn't abnormal for Portuguese women to do topless whilst lying on their bellies
A few of my friends do that
I'd say like 2-3%
In Portugal some do, but through the years you have less and less people who does this, much more in nudist beaches of course
Agreed
People are overestimating a lot
People didn't carry around instant live broadcasting devices back then I guess
'And gets everywhere'
The millennium falcon costs 1000€ and the average wage is around 930€.
Mate, if you are to receive a foreign stranger in your house, don't you want to know if maybe the guy is some kind of lunatic
I think it is normal behaviour for anyone with a sound mind
About the bringing up of "personal stuff" idk, but if something is on the net for everyone to see, then it's not personal really
Plus, Americans also have a reputation for straighforwardness, so I'd suppose people could think it would be of no matter
TIL it's normal to google someone
What the hell
Do you expect to find something related to that person
Idk about the bringing up of information
I mean it can be creepy regardless, if its out of context and of no useful purpose
Like, "hey Mary, remeber that abortion you were so sad about, like, you made a tweet a couple months ago
Well, there's that
" Or "So, we all know Mark got fired last week
I am going nowhere with this, just thought about it
What do you think about it, Mark
About the American straighforwardness, I'd concede that maybe with the Germans that may not be the case
In Portugal, where I live, and China, where I spoke to people about it coincidently, it is definitevely the case
Early modern and middle English are easy to read and understand for the most part, old English is extremely hard and i couldn't understand it
Scottish is understandable but a bit strange
Friday the 13th in the northern region
It was supossedly promoted by the church for celebrating the death of the pagan gods
The story goes that Freya was defeated and revealed as a witch and joined other witches and the Devil, making it 13 of them (or something like that)
But the rituals and celebrations (ironically) are totally pagan (animal sacrifice, and such)
They burn cats in a bonfire and dress funny
(Although the burning of cats is illegal)
It's funny because the northern region of Portugal is very Catholic, but they're the ones who preserve most of the pagan heritage
But dare you not tell them those things they do aren't Christian
Borat would love to see the figurative jew ( Judas) burnings at Easter too
The Lusitanean gods were not the Nordic gods
But that's just the story the Clergy came up with, I don't know why
I don't think we ever had Freya
The point is we have many pagan rituals and "gods" who were given a Catholic façade
For example, Saint Barbara is the "Saint of thunder"...  What's the real name of "Saint Barbara", I don't know, maybe no-one does
I can't remember any example where a Portuguese official's English was too bad
What I can remember is when our current PM tried to speak Spanish
You may rate [this]
I blame The Beatles' Love Me Do
Yes, when one speaks Portuguese with a Castillian accent you get the feeling they are fluent, until the differences in vocabulary shatter the illusion
Well we started the transatlantic slave trade
Other than that i would say the fucked up things the second Republic (fascist, 1926-1974) did including the ultramar war (1961-1974)
Well ... We literally started slavery
We started the transatlantic slave trade
Oops
Little did they knew 325 years later something whould happen
We only started the Transatlantic slave trade
The African slave trade had already been established and controlled by the Muslim world (it's several kingdoms in the West Coast and North Africa) for several decades or even centuries before we got to Africa even
We were also the first ones to abolish it
Not fully tho because our judicial system through history had problems to ensure that the law was being applicable and unfortunately the colonies continued for sometime (not that much after) even tho it was abolish for the entire kingdom and colonies
Although its a pride and accomplishment being of the first to abolish and something we should be proud we must remember that it wasn't immediate nor the pain caused to the slaves
We first abolish the trafficking of slaves (we pioneer that, 1761) but not slavery has in ownership of human beings, then in 1869 that slavery was truly abolish
Source law student
Edit dates to give context
At least that
Thats interesting
Where to start
Atlantic Slave Trade, raping native women as colonising policy, something, something, a lot, and teaching the Brits about tea (the first and the last were more or less at the same time)
We started the Atlantic slave trade
although we were one of the first European nations to abolished slavery
People seem to almost take offence that I don't like cod fish
So maybe that
A Portuguese that doesn't emigrate
Well
I'm portuguese and I don't like any kind of alcoholic beverage, do I fit in
Also, I don't despise 'AVECs' (Frenchmen or french immigrants), so I'm pretty sure I do fit in
A portuguese that doesn’t like francesinha .. I’m sorry but that’s too weird
someone who doesn't like bacalhau
If you moved to Portugal, you'd be early
Yeah maybe that, you blasphemous weirdo
What's next
you don't like aletria or arroz doce
Portuguese nationality should be taken away from psychos like you
Same i get dizzy just from the smell and just taking a bite and eating it makes my stomach feel like weird and almost like it's about to vomit, be it made by skill family members or restaurants
Same here
Only like one kind of cod fish dish (à Brás), and people get mad with it
Plus, I'm from Lisbon (alfacinha de gema) and don't like sardines
That gets me dirty looks as well
I dislike both those desserts
Spaghetti covered in cinnamon scares me
I like arroz doce fine
Aren't aletria and arroz doce essentially the same thing
I certainly don't. Bleh
I only eat rabanadas and cake at Christmas
I'm not a girl so no
that's why you don't like it
you are supposed to cook the specific noodles, use a rasp of lemon, use milk if you want
if you were served spaghetti with cinnamon then you got a whole different problem to solve
cada vez te enterras mais
Oh, Jeeez
Who the fuck likes rabanadas but doesn't like arroz doce
You are my opposite and I hate you
Rabanadas with vinho do Porto sauce is where it’s at
Shoutout to sopas de vinho too
bem me pareceu
o que tu gostas é do vinho do porto
mas isso quem não?
o Sol (male)
a Lua (female)
so it's the opposite of German
Interesting, are we the only romance languages to drop the "n" in "Luna" ? We say "Lua" here
Moon female, sun male
It’s fascinating that I always think of the moon as female and I can’t imagine it being male - funny how our language shapes the way we think
Same in Portuguese:
Male for sun: O Sol
Female for moon: A Lua
Also, for the Earth:
a Terra (female)
Interestingly, all other planets have a neutral gender, omitting its article
A couple of examples
> A Terra não é plana
> Plutão está longe
It's also worthy to note that in Brasil, omitting the article, even on gendered nouns is common
Same for the Lusos
Oh we use Terra too, written exactly like that
Piggybacking to add the Portuguese words: o sol and a lua :)
Most historians definite Portugal's golden age as the period of Discoveries comprised, *grosso modo*, from  1415 to 1543
Oh yeah, Portugal, "Os Conquistadores" (The Conquerors) Well, we discovered the sea routes to India, had a lot of colonies, trading power house
Basically the whole 700 years
Until fascism kicked in
Then it became kind of awkward
Our golden age started in 1143
And it ended with the Iberian Union
You're kidding, right
This is the real answer
Nope
It was awesome the all way through
Well
There was a generation where the country was under Spanish rule, but we don't really talk about it
As far as we're concerned, it never happened
It's Portuguese as well
Never really thought it was from Latin because it works perfectly in Portuguese as well
So I'm guessing we also don't talk about the people starving while the king built churches with Brazil's gold
Or the Inquisition's existance
Or the earthquake that shattered Lisbon
Or the Civil War
Or the multiple economic crises during the liberal monarchy and the First Republic
Awesome all the way through indeed
A taxi driver charged us 30€ for a 3km in Switzerland (but the taxi was caught in France)
Yeah we only didn't because it was raining :( the day before we did walk, and the thing is, we couldn't get an uber because we were actually in France, and in that zone there were no ubers, only in Switzerland, bad choice choosing a cheap hotel in the other side of the border
Yeah to move in the city I used the bus and mostly the tram, it was really a really beautiful city
Historical villages
[Here are some examples]
I like Viana do Castelo or Tomar but there are a lot of smaller places which are even more beautiful
Any city that is not in the Algarve or a day trip from Lisbon or Porto
I would say that right now the most popular with tourists are Evora, Obidos, Sintra, Aveiro and Braga
So all the others
Tomar, Guimarães and the Costa Vicentina are particularly pretty
As is the Azores
Visited Olomouc and had a great time
The town was a bit empty which is understandable since it was summer and I had heard it was mostly a student town
I enjoyed the calmness and the historic centre was very pretty
Our trip made me want to explore more of Moravia
I planned to visit Hungary this year before Covid 19 happened
I enjoy relatively long stays in places that aren't overcrowded and have more of a everyday life feel
For instance last year I visited the Czech Republic stayed a week in Olomouc and had a great time
Any place like that in Hungary you recommend
Probably French and Spanish, becuse, if you speak english and these two, you can speak to almost all africa, all america, all the caribbean and all of oceania
Probably French
Germany has a bigger economy and moves more people, so I'd say German, but each and every German person I met up until this point has been AT LEAST decent at English
French people on the other hand can really struggle with it
I've seen French people at restaurants in Portugal telling the waiters ". We don't speak English or Portuguese, only French" using some very broken clearly-sentence-memorized English
Also, like someone else pointed out, try to learn the language of the country you end up living in
Knowing English will get pretty much anywhere in Europe, but to feel at home, you need the native language there
Also, most people will appreciate your effort to learn their mother thounge and like you more
Good luck
How to reply to my Portuguese compatriots
Portugal  Caralho
Ps: of course I already knew the holy word "caralho", I just didn't know that I should use it on Reddit
There are more than 7 human bone chapels in Portugal
Best countries to drink a good coffee espresso shot are:
Portugal
Italy
Finland
I believe portuguese population in Luxembourg surpasses 20%! Yeah, emigration
In Portugal we usually fry eggs with vegetable oil
Feels like you guys use olive oil for nearly everything
Me too, actually
Every portuguese I know use olive oil for eggs
> Why of all places Luxembourg
B€caus€.
I see it as a snowball effect
Many portuguese people know someone in Luxembourg, so they take advantage of that support system and move there to have a better life
Knowing that there is already an established community that can help you is comforting and plays a role in it too
Luxembourg is a popular country for emigration in Portugal, as well as France, Germany and the UK, but you don't hear about large percentages because these countries' populations are massive, but there is a significant number of portuguese people in those places as well
Olive oil never sucks
You could put it on top of an ice cream, or eat cereals with it instead of milk and it'd still be delicious
I would say José Sócrates most likely, he is a former prime minister who stole A LOT of money and still hasn't gone to prison
Personally, I would also say António Salazar, our former dictator but there are still a lot of people who support him and I feel like 99
9% of Portuguese people hate José Sócrates
Joe Berardo 100%
José Sócrates former prime minister
André Ventura be like
Get a grip, 99
9% of the people in the chans, most likely
I think I can safely assert 100%. I'd say all 10
280
000 Portuguese citizens hate him
It depends
But just don't speak it like Spanish
I have seen a lot of people impressed by the level of Danish of my father but the face you guys make just seems like he is butchering the whole language
Not Portuguese
Since I dont speak it and spent New Years in Copenhagen
Same
People would then work 10h/day and that's not something everyone can do because it's exhausting and it might be incompatible with other responsibilities (like kids)
Never going to happen as long as we feel the need to keep growing/expanding
If companies get to decide between using technological advancements and better efficiency to increase profits and production, or to reduce working hours, they'll choose the first option every time
The need for GDP and population to keep growing into eternity is ingrained into everyone's minds at this point
I don't see that as clearly
It is great to be able to work a couple of days a week from home
But if companies are set up to work online, it would be much easier to outsource everything to cheaper places
United Kingdom for helping us against the French and Spanish since 1386 :D
Big ups to Italy for Pizza, the Ferrero Rocher (could stand to cut back on the palm oil, eh=), gelato, and San Pelegrino
Thanks to our Spanish cousins for being basically alright for the last 50 years or so
Mad respect to the UK for all of their sitcoms and panel shows, especially QI
Other things, not so much
Germany for sauerkraut and for some efficient and reliable cars
The French, thanks for taking in a large part of our population in the 60s, 70s, and 80s. Oh, and for the Taxi movies, I love those
I'm sure there's a bunch more things I'm forgetting, but these are some of the highlights
Thanks China
We all know where the noodle  truly started
Oh also big up to the arab and hindu world, imagine doing math with the roman system
I'd say Italy for simply making the best food in the world
I'd also say UK but they did send ultimatums to their oldest allies :I
Thank you Spain for not trying to invade us in the 20th century, cheap oil prices, and being a beautiful nearby country with a similar enough language that I can visit any time
we are no longer the best friends, but definitely England for helping us maintain independence against spain
Well, about the Dutch
And then threatening us for our african colonies >:(
Thank you for your music, half of my playlists are just English rock/metal
Dont forget about the tea
I don't know how
The British don't care much about their friends
We used to rule the world
And pillaging the country after the defeat of the Napoleonic armies
( but we love you still, as our favorite abusive partner lol)
A small price to pay being a small nation trying to play big in the "New 19/20 century Europe"
Pink Floyd
You're right
How inconsiderate of me
Thanks also for making sure Ronaldo is the kickass player he is
Sorry, mon frére, all is fair in love and football
Just really love Sauerkraut, personally
Even had it for lunch today-
No probs, I'd just advise you not to let your teen-agers come to Southern countries without supervision
Much like the British, they tend to be some huge jerks
Oh, I see
Could have given us moonehs for it instead :(
Not too late to give us some cash
/u/Peppl, I'll DM you my IBAN
Yup, i only said my favorite band :D
Legendary players are not made without great opposing sides
Without the high competitive level of the whole League, he probably would never have reached his current form: undisputed best player in the world
Iberia is already great
We're great when it comes to food, hospitality, good vibes, sunshine, and IT developers (bit of an outlier there, but it's true
We do need better politicians across the board though
Don't worry about Oliven~~z~~**ç**a.
Still ours though, eheh
People from Portugal understand the Spanish without much effort
I have no problema understanding Spanish
I can understand almost everything and I have never learned Spanish at school
Spanish is a lot closer to portuguese than to italian but I have heard that italian is easier for Spanish people idk if its true
For me Italian is a lot harder I only understand some words but its enough to understand what they are talking about but not the whole sentence
You didn't ask but I understand Spanish almost perfectly written and good enough when spoken, and can speak reasonably Spanish and poorly write Spanish
For some reason the Portuguese understand well Spanish, but the Spanish dont understand well Portuguese
I guess its due to the fonetic
Not if its catalonian
Not so much
It depends
People from Galicia understand portuguese without much effort but that does not apply to people from all Over Spain
But portuguese people in general are very familiar with spoken Spanish
For instance, when I was a child I used to watch cartoon dubbed in Spanish without subtitles
I lived in Italy (Verona) for 4 months and it was enough to reach B2 level
Yeah we eat vowels sounds wich makes it a lot harder but we also have a lot of different vowels sounds when Spanish only have 5 if i'm not mistaken
I never had a Spanish lesson in my life and I can communicate pretty well
Been in Spain several times and never had to repeat myself
Well
Whenever I try to speak Portuguese with a Spanish person - this happens when I'm in Portugal - they just wrinkle their faces
It's like they don't even try
And, of course, they don't addapt the way of speaking either
They just speak their regular Spanish
The portuguese have been so exposed to this behavior that we tend to be more "bilingual".
Besides that, portuguese is a more complex language - phonetically speaking - and we always use subtitles in movies/TV/series, etc
I've never seen having dubbed to Portuguese, with the exception of products that have children as their main target audience
Way to goddamm often
Trump, protests, california being on fire, and god forbid if it's election year
At one point some of the TV channels have very few news about Portugal, but those juicy american drama
You can bet their there
I refuse to believe that there is nothing important happening in the nation to that point
We get just a bit
And by just a bit, I mean maybe 2 minutes, 2 times per day, talking about the election
If there is a special event, like when the George Floyd protests started, we got like 10 minutes of coverage 2 times a day
The biggest news station (or at least the one with better coverage imo), has only one journalist to cover the entire USA
And still, the coverage about the elections is only "trump said something controversial  at an indoor campaign rally with most people not wearing masks, biden responded by saying that trump isnt the man for the job, and is leading by 10 points nationwide in the polls".
This is it
This is the coverage of the most influential country on earth
All time time
But I can't blame them
It's just like Idiocracy was made into a show and each episode is juicier than the previous one
Fortunately it's always reported as if it was just another episode of the sadest comedy show in history
Every fucking minute about whatever subject, usually denigrating Trump and trying to promote Biden
It's annoying af for the reason that I don't give a f about the USA and their internal problems
>I refuse to believe that there is nothing important happening in the nation to that point
Football is always happening
It is crazy that some news broadcasts dedicate as much time to football as everything else combined
I find that RTP1/2/3 usually is more reasonable, TVI and SIC loves to spread that juicy drama
For someone that doesn't even like football, this is just ridiculous
True, but that much is to be expected of the national channel
Yeah Op was talking about our country and how football is always on the news regardless, even during the pre-season and transfer market
This is r/askeurope, when we say Football, we mean the one actually played with feet
It is a year around topic over here
National competitions run for about 10 months
When local teams are not playing, the national team probably is
They only really stop for a few weeks in july/august where the transfers dominate the news and everyone is on holidays either way
In my point of view as long as we stay "separated" by  historical and political borders, have different hymns,  different languages and different cultures to fight for we will always consider that the europeans have a somehow identical cultural, "the european culture" because finally we kinda tolerate and accept other cultures and countries as well
On the contrary, on the moment that we create a "super nation" under only one umbrella things will fall apart
We will see our differences as something disruptive
The history of every nation is scarred with battles and wars for years and years
I believe that an "European Federation" is just impossible to achieve, we are not like the americans or the chinese to just unify under a single banner because we're just too different
And even if that happened, I believe such federation would be incredibly unequeal, even more when the divide between North and South already exists, just go back to the rather unpleaseant statments by Dutch ministers
Can we really expect Lisbon and Athens to have remotely equal power at the table in this federation as Berlin and Paris
Of course not
Do I feel European
Yeah, sure a bit, but I'm Portuguese first and foremost, and I sure as hell don't want to say "I'm European, from the state of Portugal".
I 100% agree with everything you said
As much as I would like to live in the United States of Europe, I know it can't possibly happen even in the next 100 years
*Hops into the conversation*
I think the reason we don't see/experience  the effecta of polarization as much as the US is :
1 Our political systems support , more or less, having multitude of parties, and in many cases coalition government are a thing, from local, regional and nation wide levels
2 The fact that we do not have Europe Wide parties, sure we have groups in the European Parlament but those have lil to no impact on local elections that are the real centers of power
Algarve
I get that it has the hot weather and beaches but what about castles and canons
Bitches love canons
I think a lot of places tourists frequent could do with a whole lot less tourists, including Lisbon
the Lello bookshop in Oporto
it's not worth waiting hours in line and paying a fee just for some stairs
I actually visited bratislava when I did a road trip across Austria
It is so close to the Austrian border that I could actually put it in my Austrian trip
I liked the city but, compared to some other cities I visited, it wasn't the best
But the roads were terrible, specially after coming from Austria
Nahhh they just need to find the cooking rat
the Algarve also has castles
Silves' is pretty impressive
As an Italian, would you recomend going to Urbino
I've heard it's quite unknow for most turists and that it's really underrated
However I don't know if that is really the case
I've heard about the Montefeltro Palace, but not much else
Sounds lovely
If I ever go to Italy, I'll make sure to make a stop in Urbino
It is both a blessing and a shame that Urbino is not that well known by tourists
What is the "rival" country of your country ?
Non europeans are welcome to answer too
We have no rivals
Spain
I'm from Portugal
I always thougth spain and portugal were rivals
Its because of transylvania isn't it
Pffff look at you thinking youre so special, we don't care about you
You ignore Portugal
i always thougth that there was some rivality because of the old times
That's why you empty your sewers in the river at the border
Same here between portugal and spain
Everyone on your border (except maybe Montenegro or north macedonia) hates you guys
Honestly for russia i thougth of ukraine or georgia
I always thougth spain and portugal were rivals
A brazilian appears from nowhere saying "they've stolen our gold
Provavelmente temos nem que seja noutro continente
To be fair the names of the capitals are similar
I think you forgot about norway
You are talking about north cyprius
Im asking you
Totaly not romania not because they have transylvania
Greenland or the rest of the nordics
Grece is about changing name to north macedonia
Why
Sort of
We are hatred rivals but we are also brothers of arms
Pick a decade, and then we decide if we are best friends or enemies
Not really, we don't really care about the Spanish, they only get annoying when they start talking about Iberian Union, as if we don't have History books over here
Never falling for that one again
Sim
agora pelos vistos temos a Venezuela
Got dammit that makes me mad
Remember Aljubarrota se eles tentarem isso outra vez chamamos a padeira
Tell me please
Same here some of us in Portugal consider you rivals but for most spain is one of our brothers
Ahh your flair says china
Yeah, in general we have a prety healthy relation
But when we were weak you guys just used us :(
But still we have a dictate saying "De Espanha nem bons ventos nem bons casamentos" meaning "From Spain neither good winds neither good marriages". There might be still a small rivalry but it's kind of a pacific one
Nah, it is fantastic
Portugal is, at heart an island nation
Plus it has been particularly useful this past month
Isnt transnistria the remenant of the soviet union
Yeah but that's due to ancient Times, just like the brazilians with us
Hope that this situation improves over there
Stay strong
Neither I thought we would deal with this so well
Even the leader of the opposition party is supporting the government, which I have never seen in my entire life
I'm actually proud of our politicians
>due to people passing out drunk in the shower
I can not imagine that being frequent
So no, it is not at all usual
well, even without temperature differences, people can have illnesses which causes them to pass out
Blood sugar, blood pressure things, allergies
yikes, no, not a good idea
Apparently some smart watches can sound a customized alarm/message system which seems like  a very good thing
That looks so
uncivilized
Commet sighted = -1 stability
What are some popular tourist destinations you don't see the appeal of
Doesn't have to be Europe only
For me it's all of those party + beach destinations like Ibiza, Mallorca, Lloret do Mar, Bali, Thailand, etc
I'm not a partying type of person so those destinations don't appeal to me at all
I guess Las Vegas counts as one as well, except for the beach part that is, with gambling added to the mix
I'm sure the neons on that street look nice at night but I'm not travelling to another continent to spend time in a giant casino theme park
I've been to Monaco/Montecarlo already, so I don't see the need to go to Las Vegas
Disneyworld in Florida doesn't interest me at all either
I've already been to Disneyland Paris as a kid
Sure, Disneyland is smaller but I'm not interested in visiting other Disney theme parks as an adult
What about you
I feel the same way about beach and party destinations, they don't interest me at all
A big part of this is due to me being from the Algarve so I already have access to that kind of stuff at home
I never understood why for the final year of high school trip a number of my classmates chose to go to Ibiza rather than Andorra
At least with the latter they could experience something different
The only beach-related holidays I'm interested in are to places with a much different geography, like the Caribbean, South East Asia and islands in the Pacific
Also Greece
Generally I also like to avoid travelling to places steeped in British holiday culture
By this I mean the type of place that aims to create a "home away from home" for Brits
I remember last year some English pals of mine went on a trip to Ibiza and the photos and videos they shared were of them in places surrounded by other Brits where everything was in English
What's the point of going to another country if you're so attached to that which is familiar to you
I mean I get that what some people want from a holiday is simply a chance to relax and that they're not bothered about learning or experiencing other cultures, but it baffles me nonetheless
Agree with your opinion on Las Vegas as well
I've no interest at all in going there
Every so often my friends talk about us having a bachelor party there, but I'd rather not
I've never understood the appeal of casinos or gambling, and the whole place just screams fake
As for your comment on Florida, I'd say that Orlando is a great place to visit if you're into theme parks
I've been to both Disneyland Paris and Disney World, and the latter's so much better because you have four theme parks as well as three water parks
And besides Disney World you also have Universal Studios, Islands of Adventure and more
>Bali, Thailand, etc
Hey, that is really unfair
I would travel to Thailand just for the food, or cooking workshops and so on
Admittedly, my teenage self liked seeing all of those coffee shops, porn supermarkets and such in the city center
I didn't enter any, but just the mere sight of them sure was a new experience
In Portugal you don't just find a sex shop like that in the open, you know
But yes, those young people who travel to Amsterdam for the sole purpose of smoking weed at a coffee shop
what's the point
Yeah, agreed
Dubai looks like a spoiled brat who likes to show off how rich his family is
Also, imagine just how brutal the heat must be
Most beaches look the same to me
As long as they're clean and safe who cares really
I'm not a beach person, anyway
And if I was I'd just visit the ones in my country
I'm not going to spend hundreds on a flight and a hotel in a faraway country to go to the beach
A lot of portuguese people se me to travel to places like Punta Cana and stay at resorts and go to the beach there
WHY
Eh I didn't mean to put down an entire country and should have explained myself better
The main reasons people seem to visit Thailand are also the beaches and partying
Maybe a lot of people visit monuments there too, I don't know
But regardless there's other countries in Asia that interest me a lot more
Japan, South Korea, China, Israel, to name a few
I don't see the appeal of Los Angeles at all
Is it even that popular of a place for tourists
When I was a kid I used to read a lot of tourist guide books and brochures
The Las Vegas hotels always left me a great impression, especially the famous MGM one
But the gambling aspect of the city didn't interest me one bit
So what would be the point of a kid staying at a Las Vegas resort
Doesn't seem like a very family friendly place
I've been twice to Paris and enjoyed it
Of course not all of it is great but it's definitely worth a visit
Unless it has changed a lot in the past decade or something
Well, yeah, a lot of the more modern architecture is pretty generic and soulless
And skyscrapers always look so out of place in European cities
Some cities and countries suffered a lot of destruction in WW2, though, which sadly means they lost a lot of their older and more interesting buildings
I know
Hence why I said "except for the beach part that  is"
I don't understand what that means lol
NYC is pretty much the only place in USA I'd visit simply because I could get around the city without needing a fucking car
It's a lot easier to visit capitals and major cities due to them having airports or more flights there
Reaching a smaller city or town can take up more time of your precious vacation time
Plus some of us can't drive, like me for example
I can't just fly to Bucharest, rent a car there and drive for 300kms to a more rural place
Norway's fjords are worth seeing
But yes, that country is crazy expensive
My brother has been to Istanbul
He said he enjoyed the Asian part of the city more
I can't drive though
And even if I could, 5 hours is a long as hell drive
London's Madam Tussauds and Natural History museums were a blast for me when I visited them as a kid
Yeah I've heard that Ibiza is actually quite beautiful
But they mostly stuck to the touristy/party areas
What a waste imo
I'm sure the AC is great in hotels and malls
but you gotta step outside to walk from one place to another
Imagine leaving your 15C hotel reception and suddenly being outside under the 45C sun
Well South East Asian countries and cultures don't interest me as much as Japan, Korea, China or even Mongolia
Going to North Korea would be interesting just to have an interesting story to tell everyone you meet that you've been there
But other than that seems pointless
You're not exactly free to walk around the country
You'll be watched by a hawk by some guide and won't be allowed to take pictures of a lot of places
You'll mostly be seeing propaganda that the country wants outsiders to see
I can't even drive, but even if I could I'd not want to spent my holidays abroad driving
I wouldn't consider a scorching desert sun and +40C temperatures as good weather, either, tbh
One that always gets me is *push* / *puxe*. *Puxe* in Portuguese is pronounced the same as the English *push*, but means "pull". So whenever I see a door has a sign saying *push* or *puxe* it messes with my brain
Pila
Portuguese for dick, Spanish for battery like AA ones, not car ones
Roxo in portuguese means purple
Rojo in spanish means red
They are not pronounced in the same way but I always found them quite similar but with different colors as their meaning
Padre in spanish is Father, and in Portuguese is Priest
In French, neck is cou, which is pronounced the same way as "cu" in Portuguese, which means ass
Why cross languages with similar words when you can just cross countries with the same language and not agree on the same words
I present to you,  the joys of two Portugueses , the Portuguese and the Brazilian ones (no clue about the other ones, sorry :/)
**The classic**
Limão

: ??? (they would not recognize it as Portuguese)
Presunto de Parma

: Prosciutto of any provenience
English: lunch
Portuguese: "lanche" (it sounds the same) - means a small meal between lunch and dinner
"Embaraçada" means embarrassed in Portuguese, while "embarazada" means pregnant in Spanish
"Pastel" in Portuguese is a kind of pastry, or something that takes cod, I don't know how to describe it
In Spanish it means cake
Today I, bring you three words that during my teenage years always made me laigh a lot
Even though we write them in different ways, they have same pronunciation
cú- cou- kuh
cu- slang Portuguese word for ass
cou - neck in french
kuh - cow in german
Also recently learn about curva and kurwa:
curva -  means curve in português
kurwa - whore in polish
Oh, that’s why I always get it wrong
In Portuguese, Pular means To Jump, so Pula is the imperative form of that verb, in the singular second person
It happens all the time
It happened in another comment in this post:
In portuguese we also say curva
If I'm right i think birra is also used by angolan portuguese to say beer
In Brazilian Portuguese it's similar, pasta means paste, and macarrão means pasta
In Portuguese Portuguese, pasta means paste, macarrão means macaroni, and pasta is massa
I love it here
Not the best country in the world, low wages, but it's very peacefull, we are about the friendliest bunch to be around, fairly cheap great food and we get to have better weather than about 90% of Europe
Would I change something
Yes
But overall, it's a great place to live
I haven't lived here for an extended period of time since high school so no, I don't like living here
There aren't as many opportunities, almost everyone is paid miserably
However, I want to buy a house here eventually in the future so I can visit frequently and I would like my children to be raised here because schools in the area I grew up in are fantastic
Nope, Portugal is an amazing place to live, we have great beaches, it's safe, people are nice (genuinely nice) food is the best, great wildlife
We also have small minded politicians
Yes I'm glad living in Portugal specially living in Porto that is the most beautiful place to be
The media isnt that corrupt, but of course you cant watch CMTV that is a basic portuguese rule
Man I love how a portuguese would be the only to complain in all this thread
We are really pessimistic
Thats really our nature
Keep strong brother
I really love Hong Kong and I hope you are aware Europe stands with you
You are more than welcome here
If you have more than 500k € to spend in real estate
You can come to Portugal and we'll give you full EU citizenship
Check Golden Visa
I can sort you out
Safest in the EU and 3rd safest worldwide
As I said before, we have our problems but we're a real mild mannered people
How do you feel about your country's location
Self-explanatory title
Portugal's location is a mixed bag
On one hand it's a good location to avoid wars that involve multiple countries
Portugal owes its stable borders to its location
But on the other hand you feel a bit isolated from a lot of interesting stuff happening in the rest of the continent, which has made travelling harder in the past and made cultural l ideas and exchange harder as well
We like to say things tend to get here later than usual
As for more technical stuff, I guess being by the ocean is alright, but I've never been on a boat in the Atlantic nor do I go to the beach so whatever
As for the weather, it's also a mixed bag
Lots of sun but also lots of wind and rain throughout the year
It should've been 10 meters further Southwest-bound
That way we would have had a moat
I think Portugal has a good geography, access to sea, while kinda protected by the mountainous north and the amount of rivers, but I think France has the better Geography, can be considered South, West, North and even Central Europe, meaning it has good connections to the outside
Border with Spain has the Pyrenees, Switzerland and Germany, they have the Alps at the border (Italy too but not much), it has good connection to sea, pathway to Britain, etc
I am not an expert but this is my opinion
I think if we were more on the interior of Europe, a Era dos Descobrimentos wouldn't have happened and a lot of things would be different tho
Even democracy arrived later to us
Last time I traveled I went to Vienna and something that surprised me were the  boards on the roads saying the distance until Bucharest, Bratislava, Prague, etc
, like if it were cities from the same country, while here in Portugal if you are close to the border you will have a board saying in caps lock "SPAIN 60 km" and that is why we feel somehow isolated
But for me the best thing of living here is the weather and the proximity to the sea
Having the sea just 15 minutes away from my house is the best thing and at least we can enjoy it during 3/4 months in a year (though the water is quite cold here in the North)
>Plus we've got each other
We're brothers
Not really
It feels like the most interesting parts of Europe are too far away from where I live
And your country feels quite distant for a neighbouring country
A huge chunk of your country is closer to France than to Portugal so I doubt it feels like Portugal neighbours you either
That's pretty cool
I've always felt like I was a bit like Switzerland when it came to conflicts among people I know
I just like to sit back and watch the world burn
France actually has a large part by the Mediterranean
Portugal has none
We're exclusively Atlantic
The Mediterranean Sea hasn't played a big role in Portugal's history, unlike the Atlantic Ocean and even the Indic Ocean
>Surely Portugal's the most ideally placed country in Europe for exploration
It has/had straight routes both down to Africa and the Cape of Good Hope and westward to Brazil and the Americas
A coloniser/trading nation couldn't ask for a better location
Yeah 500 years ago
You don't need to go that far
The UK or Ireland could do it as well
Same for France, Switzerland, Belgium or Holland
Or hell, even Iceland
> Portugal isn't enough to pose a serious threat
Only when it employs bakers
Yeah, but we have Mediterranean culture
Of course they do
It's smaller and less of a threat
As a Benfica fan I like Belenenses and Boavista more than Porto or even Sporting
He probably feels that way because he is from Lisbon and Lisbon is a bit isolated from the rest of Spain
I live 50km from the border with Galicia and I agree with you
The cities feel different but the rural areas are very similar
The landscape, the weather, the architecture and even the way the elderly sound, are all very similar
Isn't Andalusia the place of flamenco music and such
Not something I really associate Algarve with
France is "way too cold"? :p
Thst might be the reason sure
The furthest North I've been to in Portugal was to Oporto
I haven't been to Trás-os-Montes or Minho
So Galiza means nothing to me
I've only been to Madrid and the Canary Islands in Spain iirc
None of those places were any similar to Lisbon
I feel this way too
I'm from Algarve and you can definitely tell that both it and Andalusia have a big moorish influence
I used to go to Andalusia a lot during the Summer (because that's when everyone else would come to Algarve lol) and although it definitely felt different, it also felt very familiar as well
Andalusia got most of the cool ruins and architecture though
I studied in Alentejo and went to Extremadura a few times with friends and you could also see a lot of similarities
I was wondering what you meant by that
I had no idea about the similar economic activity or poterry tradition
Algarve is mostly known in Portugal for being a touristic place
A place where a lot of people have a house to go to in the summer
As for Alentejo, well it has a lot of gypsies, so I can see it being similar to andalusia in that regard
It's a quite barren place for such a large region however
It has less than 1M people and it's about the size of Belgium
It's also probably the least religious region in the country and has the highest suicide rates as well
Nah dude, I really like you
People (from European Countries) who have left their homeland and never came back
Why
To be fair, wanting to move away from Portugal (even temporarily) is a very quintessential part of feeling Portuguese
TIL Reddit has profile pics
Sorry, but is not for you to decide other people's lives just because of the political situation of where they live
Is like telling to someone who lives at USA or Brazil that they will never manage to survive because of the political situation on that countries
There are deeper reasons to someone to decide to live in somewhere besides the political issues
He's not deciding anything for anyone
What are you going on about
Yeah ok, that's less wholesome
Good on you guys to come back, I hope it brings you back anything you feel like you guys lost
yeah, I think there's more to it than economy
Spanish economy has also seen some lows historically, and they never much left the place
I haven't yet, but I'd like to try living abroad for a couple of years just for the experience, to be honest
I still use the old one
Obrar (synonym to defecate)
Mandar um fax (send a fax)
Arriar o calhau (don't know a translation to this one, but maybe "to drop a stone") (this one is the best but also kinda indelicate)
We have that as well
Also we have a racist version of it, which is "dropping Obama at the swimming class".
Sorry if it offends someone
You Spanish bros, you're very much like us in these things, but always bit more creative and hilarious
"Mandar uma carta ao salazar" - "I'm going to send a letter to Salazar"
Salazar being the portuguese dictator
&#x200B;
Edit: Added some context and translation
vou ali pintar as paredes da sanita (just going to paint the toilet seat walls)
vou ali fazer uma chamada ao Papa (going to drop a call on the "Pope" -> the Pope dresses white as the toilet seat usually is white) was used a lot in my teens
A bit racist but one I used to hear a lot was "Largar o Eusebio/Mantorras" - drop Eusebio/Mantorras (former black football players from Benfica)
"pintar a sanita à pistola" - roughly translates to "Spray-gun paint the toilet (bowl)", used when you have diarrhea or very liquid poop
Fazer uma chamada no telefone branco
Cortar o charuto (To cut the cigar)
"Fazer um número 2" - to do a number 2, number 1 being peeing
"To send a fax" is also a very popular one in Portugal
I think there was some Ladas here in Portugal back in the day
50 years old
Thought it was older
What was your "that's not how we do things here" story
When I moved to the uk and started meeting people I would always go for two kisses, took me a couple of times to forget that and start giving handshakes
Also when I took some friends to lisbon for a week, they were 3,one British one American and one from Canada, I told them we were going clubbing, they thought we were going home attl 2am, I felt sorry for them when we left at 7
I was once strolling around the city center passing the time until dinner when a group of foreigners approached me and asked where was the party
I replied "what party
" and a guy replied "they told us this is the party area and there should be many parties around".
They didn't believe me when I told them that no reputable bar would be open at 21 and they should go for a coffee and come back in at least two hours
I sometimes wonder what happened to those people
Once I invited one friend from the Netherlands to my house, so we could have dinner with the rest of my portuguese friends and go on a night out
Well, he showed up at my house at 6:30 and I was a bit surprised but ok, no problem, them at around 7:30 he asked me why wasn't nobody at home yet, I said that they we would only eat at around 9:30
Late the night, we were in a bar at around 00:30 am and he asked me if we were not going to the club anymore
I said that we were, but only in 1h or 2h... He was so confused
Same experience in Germany
Germans will often hug as a greeting which makes it extra confusing
Lemme guess
English
Oh I feel for you men, I'd have waited for them to invite me into their house too so I guess I'd have done what you did
10 ssems pretty late
I have dinner between 19h00 and 20h30
I would be in trouble then
I take a lot of medication, so I can't drink alcohol
I'm one of those who always asks for a coke when going out :)
Same here though, even in a restaurant ordering something that's not wine or beer is kinda strange
Truuuuuuust
Very common in the UK
Every time I'm out drinking here they're puking already by 1am
In Portugal n Spain 1am is about the time I get out of the house
Same here, and if you go to a restaurant with friends or something you can even start eating at 22:30--23
Yeah that was another one, once I meat the people they started to hug me, which I find very awkward tbh
Not an UK accent but unfortunately I couldn't identify the origin back then
I assume Nordic by their looks
It's just a culture thing
Most people here go to sleep between 11pm to 1am
Even my grandparents go to sleep at around midnight
I only go to bed at 10pm if I'm feeling super tired or sick
Completely normal here though
Nowadays you tend to see people with all kind of schedules, however there's still a cultural impact that lead most of us to have those eating and sleeping routines
But, for instance, go back some 50 years ago (in villages, maybe 100 in cities) and the people routine would be guided by the sun itself, not clocks
At 10PM in Portugal, at least in the summer, would still be bright, and so, not sleeping hours
Then, people, would go to sleep only at 11PM, or even a bit later
And they would wake around 6AM
7AM
Then you could ask, "wait
but then some people would sleep only 6 hours, isn't that why too little ?", Yes my friend
But then, after a hard working day in the fields and factories, the husband would arrive home and take a little nap of around 30 min
Really
Because I've been to Rome and the traffic is wild
Huh idk much bout Nordic but the British are already drunk by 2200
[This one from Ireland] is even worse
It actually got banned before 9 pm
*Raises glass expectantly*
To your health, my future friend
My 92 year-old grandma goes to bed at 1:30 am
in my experience, Brazilians and Spaniards really crank it up to eleven with the noise
It's okay, I get to drink champagne on New Years though
>Kofola
They don't sell that here
Plus, I always get Cola Zero or Sumol
Never
Well, ours made Trump almost faceplant with a hand-shake, four days after being hospitalised from a heatstroke, so I guess we'd fare pretty well
Edit: Wait, Trump just called him
WTF IS GOING ON, PEOPLE
But she's immortal
No one can defeat the queen
I'm Portuguese
My parents are Brazilian
Growing I never felt like I fit in or felt connected to my roots
I was constantly told I didn't look Portuguese or Brazilian (because I'm super pale - which is silly but still)
I spoke English from a very young age and my dream was to move to the UK as I felt it was a better fit culturally so to speak
I managed to move to the UK 3/4 years ago, and I still think it's a great fit culturally but now I'm constantly reminded that I'm foreign
So, I don't fit in Portugal because I'm too "foreign" but in the UK I'm constantly getting questioned as to where I'm from (literally like once a day as people can't place my accent) and why I'm here and when I'm moving back  to Portugal
Sometimes you just can't win
I'm too "foreign" for both countries
I've resigned myself to live "In-between" cultures
The key to being a true Portuguese is to comment "Portugal caralho
" every time you see Portugal mentioned on the Internet
It depends, really
If you're at a party, no one will really say anything unless it was really dumb to get drunk for some reason
If they're your friends, they'll keep an eye on you
If you're telling random people, they'll most likely politely leave your side
However, if you are NOT at a party, it is not very common and people don't tend to like it
People drink alcohol with their meals (wine and beer), but not much as to not get drunk
If you are randomly walking around in Lisbon while drunk you are sure to get started at
But if you make your way to the party districts at night, people will dance with you
I agree, but among close friends sometimes people say “tonight I really need to get drunk” or something like that, and they really get drunk or totally waisted, and everyone gets the message and understand that
For sure, but I think that was the point of the question
Among friends it's fine and no one will say anything unless it's reckless to get drunk (e.g. if you're pregnant, if you have a job interview the next day something like that)
You can actually get some very passable wines for 3 euro in Portugal
Or you can get bagged wine for 60 cents or lidl vodka for 4 euros a bottle
Love my drinks as anyone else but it's far to cheap to be an alcoholic in this country
People going to the Church
Religious practice appears to be dying off fast in Portugal
Bonus: sleeping the "sesta" in the afternoon
Asking someone for directions, now you only use the GPS
Weekly
Where did you live
Oh, the nostalgia
The hot summer afternoons, no one out on the street, all Nature is silent except the happy sparrows
And then, that whistle
In my street there is a old man that does that, but he is probably one of the few left in the country (and I really like the sound of the whistle)
There is still one around here
There are a few restaurants and that seems to be his main clientele
It is an old man with a tuk-tuk hand decorated with Benfica symbols
This one
And so France decided to join the dirty butt gang because of a chauvinistic joke
They are dying a bit in the younger generations, but compared to the rest of Europe we are still a very Catholic country
I don't mean religious belief in particular, I mean practice
If you were to compare it with a few decades ago, there are way less people marrying, being baptized, doing first communion, attending church on Sundays, etc
Still more than other countries, maybe, but it's drastically descresed in just a few decades or even years, I belive
Yeah, same here
I don't think we do
At least I've never seen anything like that in real life
I've seen Jeovah's witnesses distributing panflets/leaflets either on the street or by knocking on people's doors and that's about it
That's also pretty much the only kind of situations I've ever seen religious people actively proselyting in public
They don´t really exist in Portugal, maybe I have seen one or two, but it's not a widespread thing
I have been to the states and that was one of the weird things, that and American flags EVERYWHERE, which was very strange to me, I mean I like being Portuguese but people around here aren´t so gung-ho about it
Never seen one personally, actually I have seen more billboards that are more "sinner" than "pious"
It is very rare
There are two kinds:
- one vaguely religious but related to the religious festival of the local town which will likely list the schedule for everything, including the religious procession and the music concerts
"Festas em Honra de Saint Whatever
". This past year all have been cancelled and I have ocasionally seen a few simple billboards remind of the festival in general
- evangelical brazillian churches might have really lurid billboards (like "dia de beleza", day of beauty, go to their garage-church and get beauty treatments at a discount) or even roadside billboards
This is really rare, and often it is really creepy because they are kind of promising a solution to family or drug problems or money problems
It is not as creepy as yours though, though our culture is different, they are really alien here, and they are kind of careful to not make political statements or be too splashy, because they are foreign after all
to quote George Carlin:
"He(God) loves you, and He needs money
He always needs money
He's all-powerful, all-perfect, all-knowing, and all-wise, somehow just can't handle money
Yap, and if there were it would be the typical  "Jesus loves you" near a church or something, definitely no "hell is real" shenanigans lol
You have those brazilian churches, there is even one on the A1 S-N just outside Lisbon
And the Mormons that now have a huge temple in Lisbon, courtesy of the Lisbon mayor Me(r)diña.
Yeah, if you see a Portuguese flag outside someone's home it's probably still from the Euro 2004 that people got to lazy to take it off
We had Portuguese flags EVERYWHERE in 2004
I thought everyone had eternal life
I thought the open question is: will it be pleasant
Ugh Brazilian evangelicals are super creepy and annoying
Brazil is the USA of South America, pretty much
Yes, generally on old cinemas
They use the old cinema's bill boards to promote their services
The place where I once saw "The Return of the Jedi", now for only 10% of your income plus other regular donations will help you rid your body of demons
> courtesy of the Lisbon mayor Me(r)diña.
Why wouldn't they
They paid for everything, I think around 20-30 million euros
[The park and public space around are great
I used to see Mormons quite often whenever I travelled by bus to my uni from my home town (and vice-versa)
At least I'm assuming they were Mormons
It was always two guys wearing short sleeved white shirts and ties, and generally they were blonde
Yes, 2004, when we found out that there are a lot of people that all of a sudden loved the flag soo much, but apparently didn´t know not to hang it up upside down
or how it even looks, since they bought a chinese knock off with little pagodas instead of castles on it :D
yes, but that was for the euro 2004, Portuguese people only get gung-ho nationalistic about football
From what I saw in the US that's just everyday life with no apparent reason
That's awesome
I  I would love to have our flag waved on a flagpole in my backyard like the Americans
Italian and Spanish for me
I find Italian easier to read but Spanish easier to understand when spoken
I'm Portuguese, and it's incredibly easy to read Galician (Galician and Portuguese are sister languages), and Spanish
We can also get a general idea about something written in Italian or Catalan, and maybe French, to a lesser extent
I swear sometimes it's easier for me to understand italian than some Spanish speakers but written I would say in order of comprehension: spanish>italian>catalan>french
Spanish is really easy to understand
French and italian we can understand when reading, but some words sometimes i only get when pronounced and others not at all
I'm 100% with you
I find it easy to read Italian since the structure is similiar, once you know the some basic italian verbs it becomes a lot easier
I also think there's a lot of similarites with Spanish
As a portuguese you can easily understand galician and spanish (speaking and reading)
The regular verbs are almost identical and lots of similar vocabulary
You can understand catalan (writen and spoken) and also italian (more writen than spoken)
French you can understand a bit
English if they use formal words (coming from norman)
Romanian you can understand some words (and try to make a guess overall)
Everything else not latin it sounds strange ... or in this case
"extraneus" :)
Yes, Portuguese is quite similar to Italian or Spanish (when it comes to understanding the sentence)
And PLEASE, its portUguese not portOguese
I'd say Spanish and maybe Italian, not so much French
We have some different vocabulary and our accents are completely different (I've heard some foreigners say that Brazilian Portuguese sounds like Spanish, and Portuguese Portuguese sounds like Russian)
And they also completely disregard a ton of grammar rules
We can understand 98% of what they say, they have a bit of a harder time understanding us, but we can talk just fine
And you are making a typo
It's Portuguese, not Portoguese
Same lol the accent from the Azores is impossible to understand
Yeah, we don't really like to open our mouths when talking
My mouth kinda gets tired when speaking English, French, or Spanish lol
It's ok, didn't know that
Coffee
Having a coffee in the morning and after lunch is a ritual so many Portuguese cannot go without (myself included)
Sometimes you'll see some extraordinarily bad parking near a café around lunchtime and you just know that it's because the driver went to have a coffee
The art of "desenrascar", which is more or less improvise, aldo it has a stronger meaning
Portuguese, if you van explaine it better, please do it
Humm probably food habits and dishes (eating a lot of vegetables meat and especially fish, and eating dishes like bacalhau, bifanas etc and bakery goods like pastel de nata)
Also our hate/love rivalry/relationship with the Spain (or the different kingdoms that make Spain with exception being Galiza), if in almost 900 years this hasn't changed probably not gonna change in future
Watching the Portuguese soccer team in a cafe with family and friends everytime it plays against another country will never end in Portugal
Yeah most of my family gatherings (in Portugal) include a moment of one family member sharing their homemade licor/spirit (and in some cases wine)
That and eating tremoços with a cold beer during football match
Yes, there's no way that coffe will go down in popularity around here
It is also so damn good :)
It changed a lot
I remember my grandfather and his generation not liking Spanish people
I do think 2 generations after we see them as brothers, and we like them
Except maybe for the part that they fill every Lisbon sidewalk with their laid-back tourist asses and don't let people that actually work there move faster
It's ingrained even in formal writing
Japanese schools / keigo seminars teach you how to always start a formal email or letter with a small reference to the weather
And then there's nominikation: remember all those formal rules
Forget it
Yes, it's a mandatory company dinner, but everyone is drunk so make all the unprofessional comments you want and pretend it didn't happen once you sober up
Definitely pão com chouriço, bread with a chouriço inside great after a night out that with caldo verde and you are good
Blessed comment
Nah, bifana
E torresmos
Oh yeah bifana too for sure
BIFANA E PÃO COM CHOURIÇO CARALHO
Choripan looks more like a hotdog though
In our pão com chouriço, the chouriço is sliced and added to the bread dough before cooking
There is also a variation where they also use cheese
They might be the same thing
There are some variations, but the one I know is made from the pork belly fat
They cut it into tiny pieces, mix it with salt and other spices and fried on its own lard until it becomes crunchy
What's your province
If it's like [these ones] they look more like the pig cut we use to make entremeada
For reference, they have a similar meal in Denmark
I think [our torresmos] make more use of the pig's fat than the meat
Not really
A lot of people have flags, around euro 2004 there was a really massive movement of people getting a national flag to support our team
I wouldn't think anything of it if someone told me they had one
Usually when people have our flags on display it's either because a) it's either worldcup or eurocup season; b) they're emigrées that have come back to Portugal for vacation or to live out their retirement
It is not that odd normally
Expect it to be seen almost everywhere in National Holidays or Soccer tournaments
If by odd you mean unusual then sure
At most people might buy cheap ones during the Euro/World Cup
You don't normally see people displaying flags on their windows
And why would people own and display national flags all the time
That seems so pointless
>it's the "cool" thing nowadays
That tends to happen when your 3rd biggest political force is a fucking far right party
>Portuguese people have a reputation of being too patriotic,
We do
That probably was on the Parliament or some oficial building, those are normal
But in a normal house, unless there is a football match or something, you don’t see flags
That's just one flag though
You should've killed all of those fascists when the people regained the state
Like us during PREC
They were never gone
They were just hidden
The one from Parque Eduardo VII
That one Sure is big
Also, several years ago it had a big hole on it and took them forever to fix it lol
I don't see the point of that huge flag tbh
It's literally the only massive flag I've seen on real life
Parque Eduardo VII
You have some info about that flag in the Portuguese wiki page
(the park has a name of an English king)
What is your country's most famous photograph
What photo do you think is recognized by everyone in your country as being really important and having a significant historical value
For example, i find that Portugal's is the one of Salgueiro Maia making the peace sign with is hand during the April 25th revolution
Edit: [here's the one is was talking about ]
Also from PT and also from Eduardo Gageiro at the time of the revolution, i think this [one] one is even more powerful
That’s definitely not the most famous one I would say [this] one or [this] one
I just got chills from looking at that photo
Same my dear neighbor
We have the same phrase in Portugal "Rouba, mas faz". Sadly, too many justify corruption this way".
(Not *very* similar but it's as close as it probably gets)
From the night of April 24th 1974 to the Morning of April 25th 1974 The News Broadcast was basically held hostage by the "Armed Forces Movement" (MFA) to announce they had full control of RTP (State owned TV and Radio company)
They then began announcing on RTP1 and on RTP's radio stations that they were gonna make a revolution against the dictatorship of Salazar -- this revolution was later known as the Carnation Revolution
No, it is our history
there are forts, castles everywhere, and you learn about the wars from an early age, because it is still so present
we got lots of war veterans
And if you look at other continents, other civilizations, war is kind of a constant in world history
It is the lond decades of peace and prosperity which are the achievement
In Russia it is said that “there is no family where nobody died in WWII
” so it ends up being quite similar story
Mostly disused but you can still find some of these in agrarian or fishing related issues:
Arroba - 14,688 kg, usually rounded up to 15 kg
Grosa - 144 units or 12 dozens
Still very much in use in winemaking ( and I still recall buying a quartilho of unpasteurised warm milk from the owner of some cows):
Tonel - 2 pipas or 840 litres
Pipa - 25 almudes or 420 litres
Almude - 2 potes or 16,8 litres
Pote- 6 canadas or 8,4 litres
Canada - 4 quartilhos or 1,4 litres
Quartilho  - 0,35 litres
Hurrah for the metric system
It's 15kg in Portugal
Funny enough we used the same alternative measurements, bar the cristianos Ronaldos
Stronger Lusitanian donkeys could carry more
Portuguese food
When I was younger I thought it was boring compared to other cuisines, especially Italian and Japanese, but after having lived in and visiting other parts of the country, as well as having spent a year abroad I realize just how much I love
I still don't think it looks as fancy as certain other cuisines, but it's delicious nonetheless
I can also say the same for architecture
I used to think our old buildings here were dull and that we didn't have proper medieval architecture (in my mind medieval = timber houses back then)
I just thought our buildings were boring and disliked the white wall aesthetic
But as I got older I finally realized that not every country in Europe had old buildings of the same style
I came to love the Southern European style we have, particularly the typical architecture of the Algarve and Alentejo regiona
These days I try and take photos of all the old little houses I find, particularly their front façades
And in uni I came to learn that we have a lot of great modern architects in Portugal, many of whom have designed incredible buildings
I did not like Fado and I did not like soup
I have really learned to appreciate cod
When you're a child, you're all into hamburguers, pizza, spaguetti, sausages and so on but as a proud portuguese I started to enjoy a good dish of cod since I was 14/15 years old, mainly when it's christmas eve
Small talk in bureaucratic offices
Sounds weird, but I used to get so annoyed when people where chit-chatting and consequently holding the line for everyone else
But after living in Germany for a year I had to get a new passport at the Portuguese embassy and the small talk was so refreshing and heart-warming - to be able to connect with the human behind the counter instead of just trying to make it as efficient as possible
Sometimes slowing down is worth it
Same with Fado, now I even learned to sing a bit of it
Thanks
When I was younger I honestly felt like we were small and insignificant, with nothing much to offer
I had a really narrow-minded view of the country and kept thinking everywhere else in Europe was better, but as I got older I came to appreciate a lot of stuff about Portugal
I'm glad it's becoming more popular (though Lisbon and Porto are a bit hectic now) and more people are discovering it
And I'm glad you had a good time visiting Portugal
I really need to visit the Netherlands at some point
I've only ever passed through Maastricht by car but have yet to properly visit the country
A lot of people I know my age went to Amsterdam for the "usual reasons", but I'd love to go to your country primarily because of the art and architecture
You have a lot of great painters and very beautiful buildings
Agree, but I think there has been more like an evolution of Fado rather than only ourselves growing up
Nowadays you have really popular and distinct Fado singers (António Zambujo, Ana Moura, Carminho) and before was just a sad and melancholic song
Just see [this performance] on letterman and tell me something
It just shivers me everytime I listen
I am living outside Portugal and really miss our (fast food like) soup chains
There's nothing like a healthy and filling bowl of soup when you need some comfort food
This is not a european fast food restaurant, but it exist in a lot of European countries, bit not in Portugal
FIVE GUYS
I WANT FIVE GUYS' RESTAURANTS IN LISBON
I've had Nordsee in Berlin and I didn't think it was that good
What did I miss
I only tried it once
It was the saddest tasting fish I've had in my life
But to be honest I wasn't expecting much better in Germany
We say 'email' or just 'mail', afaik
Old people or more formal institutions still use 'correio electrónico', which was meant to be our translation for email, but it barely stuck back then and most people don't use it anyway nowadays
Same
Shame I can't use it professionally
Like other people have said, it's got to do with the English word mail not bring previously used as a loanword
It happens with some other stuff, here in Portugal at least
Plenty of people call Facebook "Face" for instance
Sometimes people also say "cheese" meaning cheeseburger, and since we don't call actual cheese "cheese" in English, it's not confusing at all
I laughed at this
Definitely masculine in Portugal
Spain
England
Brazil
India
Some African country, I can't choose
It could be Angola, Mozambique, Guiné, etc
Also North Africa
EDIT: This is quite hard to choose
Portugal is nearly 1000 years old (first established in 868) and had a global colonial and trade empire that only completely disappeared in the 70s. There are centuries old Portuguese diasporas spread all over
EDIT2: Someone asked me to write the reasons for these choices so that outsiders could understand better
So I will try:
Spain
I think this is obvious
Castile was Portugal's arch nemesis
England
Portugal's oldest ally
We helped each other in numerous wars and most importantly, they helped us maintain our empire and independence
In the end they betrayed us so we murdered their king's cousin (our king) and made Portugal a Republic
Brazil
The jewel of the Empire
Rio de Janeiro was once Portugal's capital
Then our king declared "independence" from Portugal, and abandoned us for Brazil
And then regretted and came back
India
The Portuguese discovered how to sail to India through the Cape of Good Hope (named by the Portuguese, because of this feat
It used to be called Cape of Torments), largely exposing India to the World
Today, some christian Indian communities refer to themselves as "Portuguese", since for them it's synonyms with christian
Territories in Africa were the last to gain independence
By the 20th century they weren't formally colonies, but actual regions
The Constitution stated that "Portugal starts in Minho and ends in Timor". Many Portuguese people lived there
The Portuguese had to fight a decade long war against independentist proxy militias armed by the Soviet Union and the USA, that let to a wave of refugees into Portugal, called the "retornados" (those who return)
The war ended when the military made a coup against the fascist regime
It was about this time we decided to be a European country, more specifically, an Eastern European one
The history of Portugal and it's Empire is veeeeeery long and complicated
Note that this is a country that maybe once had the equivalent (for the time) projection the USA has today, for maybe 2 centuries
But if you are curious and don't want to grind through history books, maybe try reading "Os Lusíadas". It's an epic poem about our history, with a lot of fiction and mythology, but conveys and idea
I believe it would be something like this:
Castile / Spain
Roman Empire
Cordoban Caliphate  / Taifa kingdoms (including here the Almoravid and Almohads)
England
France
If you want it from a currently existing countries point of view, then:
Spain
Italy (not only due to the Roman empire but also due to the Papal State / church politics , and the importance of the Republic of Genoa in the early Portuguese expansion)
England
France
Brazil
I think I would have gone with France for number 4
Napoleonic failed invasions and the liberal movements were some key moments for France
That's it
If we consider European countries only there is one list
If we consider all countries then Cabo Verde, Angola, Mozambique, Guiné, S. Tomé, Brazil, Timor take the top spots
I would include China and India but we learn only about the history of the smaller bits we kept until later
Yes, you're right
All in all, our history is really all over the place
I would even put Brazil below France, actually
Portugal (and most of Europe) have been very influenced by France
Influence on/from Brazil existed, of course, but was in such a simple and straightforward colonial way, you wouldn't need more than a few paragraphs to explain it
Even their independence war didn't take that long, and after that, there was a lot of movement of people, but not that much political influence back and forth, really
I don't know what game you are playing
But if you want to keep Castile at bay you need to use the UK and the Church
If you want to try and conquer it, I would suggest trying to turn the other Iberian nations against it
I edited the original comment :)
Oh definitely
Much like Spain, if we consider relations in the times of the exploration, almost the whole world gets included
On Japan in particular we made quite an impact with guns, religion and food
Other countries in the region like Sri Lanka and Indonesia were at least as much impacted
In 100 years, I would hope the United Nations functions the way the EU does today, and the EU functions the way the US does today (in terms of being a federation, not everything else about it)
How did Germany enslave the rest of the countries
I really hate this victimisation narrative that poor countries like mine tell ourselves
They hit a new record in their exportations since 2018 in the past month of September
During a damn world pandemic
They must be doing something right
They what now
I'm not following
Edit: accidentally hit save
How are they enslaving us
That was my original question
That won't happen
People in charge are not dumb and they know they can't create a federation if they destroy or vanish state's culture, because it would raise nationalist sentiment and soon or later break the federation
National culture and identity is essencial for the European Federation to exist
Also because they are the economical powerhouses of the EU
football coach Jorge Jesus
That man should do humour instead of being a coach
he is a quite good coach - he just won the Brazilian league and the libertadores cup (Latin America champons league)
however he speaks in a weird way and is constantly mispronunciating some words
People pick those mispronunciations and create memes, videos and the rest is history
"Preço Certo". Its a show where basicaly you have to guess the price of things and then win a variety of prizes
However, it has quite a funny/ jokimg around environment and the main host, "Fernando Mendes", makes it much better (along with a few more details)
So its very memed both the show and the host
There was a very funny exchange on TV in a sports commentary program where one guy is demanding the other "diga um" (tell him one [example]), and the other guy responds that there are many but doesn't give an example, so the first guy keeps yelling "DIGA UM" while holding his finger in the air
[This] is the whole thing (the other guys is saying "vários" meaning "there are many")
And [here] is the template (although any picture of him holding up his finger is fine to use)
Very nice, Poland, I'm impressed
But you won't ever beat us, WE SHOT HIM
Portuguese football and their characters  could be a giant meme
Spain
But it's like a brotherly rivalry
Still love Spain though
Spain is the sibling that we're always fighting and will never ever admit we love them
The UK is the best friend we consider a brother from different mothers
France is the girl we used to hate way back, dated for a while but still are good friends after it was over
And our ex-colonies are the sons
I completely disagree
Brasil is the brother country
True
Love Spain and Portugal
They are as different as they are similar ahah
Well to be fair, brother and best friend are very different concepts
Spain is definitely the brotherest country we have
Not after the Pink Map and their Ultimatum
You do know our national anthem was originally an anti-British anthem, right
You're also in one of our places, give Olivença back
It's a bit of both
I hear brazil being called "povo irmão" and spain "nuestros hermanos" all the time
Can't we have two brothers
I would say that the actual contact with Brazilian culture trumps the cliche intros when someone decides to make a video about Spain
I suppose
But then lets also give a call to Italy and France
Everyone in the family loves Italy, too
They are definitely the Fonzie of the group
Change the name, there's only one real Estremadura
we feel the same way about spain too
The joke was that there's also a region in Portugal called Estremadura (central coast area)
Eu entendi perfeitamente o teu comentário, não foi difícil aliás foi bastante fácil sem qualquer tipo de dúvida, não surpreende é bastante normal, tendo em conta a influência histórica, cultural e geográfica
Caso a parte, mas como é que estão as coisas por aí em Espanha
As notícias que recebemos sobre Espanha são chocantes, até faz medo para ser honesto
Um abraço de Portugal para com todos na Europa e no mundo que estão a passar por esta situação difícil
Orgulho da nossa família Latina  :)
No outro dia estava a ver o filme Django, do cineasta italiano Sergio Corbucci, e surpreendeu-me como estava a compreender as falas dos actores
Tanto falada como escrita, a lingua requer alguma concentração para ser compreendida mas a adaptação é rápida
Quanto ao espanhol, compreendo sem o menor esforço, tanto escrito como falado
O Francês é mais difícil de compreender mesmo ao fim de 5 anos de estudo
Ainda assim consigo interpretar o conteúdo duma conversa com base em palavras soltas que se assemelhem às de outras linguas latinas
O Romeno é o mais difícil de todas por ser uma língua com forte influência eslava
Algumas palavras são realmente parecidas com português mas acabo por não conseguir enquadrá-las num contexto
Tirando algumas palavras como "hilo" ou "logrado"  percebi basicamente tudo o que disseste
É muito fácil entender espanhol sem dúvida, até falado dá pra perceber
Quando fui visitar Madrid e Sevilha nunca precisei de usar inglês, um portunhol improvisado chegou para me conseguir orientar
Eu consegui entender tudo o que se encontra escrito nesta publicação e achei esta ideia bastante enriquecedora
É fantástico como apesar de nunca ter aprendido espanhol é possível ler textos nesta língua com facilidade
Vou ler vários comentários de modo a perceber até que ponto consigo compreender outros idiomas também.
Entendi quase todo o comentário, mais ao menos 90%.
Boa quarentena
-De Portugal
Acho que percebi tudo (%100) no entanto espanhol sempre me foi muito mais difícil ouvir do que ler
Francês é o mais fácil de ouvir para mim mas não tenho muito contacto Italiano
A lingua dos Romenos é que me dá mais curiosidade, gostava de saber se algum Romeno conseguiria perceber alguma coisa do que eu escrevi e vice-versa
Sou só eu que estou a ler os restantes comentários e a praticar o meu sotaque nas diferentes línguas
Percebi tudo sem grandes problemas
Estranhamente tentei traduzir à letra e não ficou muito bem
Escrito
Espanhol 85% prai
Italiano uns 50%
Francês uns 30%
Romeno uns 10% no máximo
Falado
Espanhol uns 50%
Italiano uns 30%
Francês uns 20%
Romeno praticamente nada
Percebi tudo, até palavras como vizinhança (vicinanza) são claras
Somos todos irmãos, filhos do latim
Apenas não compreendi "anche" e "spiegare" :)
Comparando o espanhol e o italiano e tendo em conta que o tamanho de ambos os comentários é quase igual, eu diria que percebi 99% do comentário espanhol (só não sabia a palavra "hilo") e 95% do comentário italiano (não percebi o significado de "intellegibili" e "spiegare")
Mas tenho a dizer que já vivi em Itália 4 meses por isso é mais fácil para mim perceber do que um português em condições normais
Quando ouço romeno dá-me a sensação de que estou a perceber as palavras mas depois não sei o que está a ser dito
When I hear romanian it gives me the sensation that I'm understanding the words but then I don't what's being said
Literalmente só percebi 2 palavras do que está aqui escrito
Desde que subscrevi a este subreddit, tenho visto bastantes romenos a dizerem que percebem outras linguas latinas por a própria língua ser uma delas, mas eu fico super confusa porque, a meu ver, não têm nada a ver
Em comparação, falando português, entender espanhol e boa parte de italiano é pêra doce
Romeno
Nada a ver mesmo, desculpem
Percebi o suficiente, cerca de 80%. Deu para captar o sentido
E o mirandês!!!
I understood around 60% maybe more, and got the general idea, it's about the language of Gauls, their culture their institutions, laws and how different they are to Latin language and roman empire (from the implicit context of the way its written)
How the region is divided in 3 parts
How far or close, am I to what's on the text it self ?

Neo-latim
Apenas percebi estas palavras
Sim é muito fácil entendermo-nos mutuamente basta cada um falar mais lentamente que o normal que a ideia passa
Out of curiosity what does conas mean in that context
Cause here conas literally means cunts
Giro que a palavra vizinhança é mais parecida com a palavra italiana do que com a espanhola
Eu também estudei francês, por isso cheguei lá sem esforço.
Eu pessoalmente acho mais fácil entender o espanhol latino que o espanhol europeu, particularmente como falam no México
Os espanhóis quando falam muito rápido são difíceis de entender, mas devagar percebo
E o espanhol escrito entendo 70%.
Oh :(, espero que isto melhore depressa
i wasn't really sure if i got it right or wrong when i originally read it so i lowball it when I said "60% maybe more" but now that I have the confirmation, i can safely say that it was more around 70/80%. The thing with Latin that makes it a lot easier to understand at least for me is the etymology, there's also an intuition aspect of it idk how to describe it but there's a logic to it
It's beautiful that Latin still lives on, through its "children languages".
Portugal
We do that to wish prosperity
(Finally I read something I can identify with
No kidnapped brides, no broken dishes or glasses, no discussion about who enters first in the church
Just plain rice
Something [like this]

I have three ideas for the Portuguese flag
Let me know which one you like better
The Portuguese flag looks like it belongs to an African country
Too colorful
Red and green mean nothing and don't go along well
So I would change it back to white and blue
The colors would divide the flag in half, not 2/5
I would remove the yellow sphere
It was only used when Portugal was a Kingdom
And I would increase the size of the shield since the sphere is no longer there
Just the red and green
No need for all of that busy business in the middle
wouldn't mind seeing a dragon behind the union jack though
would look pretty badass
I approve
Yes please
800 years of blue and white shouldn't be erased
And the meaning of a "peaceful nation by the sea" is better imo
Would the Azores flag get green and red instead
Agree, but I'd also make the proportions historical
50% Blue, 50% White
Bro i was going to say the same thing
Meh, i kinda like how it is now, its more original
I think the most overused colours in flags are white red and blue, but the red and green combination is kinda rare, and cool imo
Is nice butt I prefere the white and blue with the cross
I'm not a monarch I just thing is more Beautiful and simple
The flag of king Sancho 1 (1145-1185) is my favourite
ahahahaha have you been drinking
That'd the make the flag meaningless
Some history tour guide:"And here we have the flag of Portugal, as you can see it has too colours,red, which simbolizes the blood spilled in the conflicts fought and green, which simbolizes hope"
Tourist: "Inspiring"
The busy business in the middle gives personality to the flag, each piece has a meaning and history
Yes, people wanted these colors but the Republicans didn't want anything related to the monarchy
I'd also like it better 50/50, just for design purposes
But that would be very similar to the monarchy flag and I don't think it would be very well accepted by everyone
Pautas e vinho verde, caralho
Yeah of course it has
It would be weird not to
It just makes it uglier
Your description sounds fine, actually
Example: Ukraine , blue for the skies, yellow for the wheat and sunflowers
Great, moving on
Plus, it makes it much more recognizable
A flag should have symbolism, but it doesn't have to be a history lesson
As is, if you look at it for 3 seconds and want to draw it it's: red, green, squibly lines in the middle
To the point, see how it looks if it's small: . You don't really see anything but squibles, except for red and green
Flags should be able to be reproduced in a small form, as they are often far away or in the wind
While the portuguese flag is still recognizable because the red green scheme, veritcally separated as such is not so common, the squigly middle doesn't contibute much towards that
But that's just my opinion, I'd expect most people not to agree with that take
868-1139 de date and the Cross is central
When you copy the copy that copied you
Lol your flag is Beautiful
Much love
Brothers
Your flag
You mean that [blatant copyright infringement]
> Honestly I think it's a great idea to have all Slavic people have one similar thing just so we remember that we were once same people
Maybe you Prague Slavic Congress shouldn't have base the colours on the Russian flag and used the 3 combination of colours that are the most used in order to achieve that purpose
Nah, we still hold the license
You can still see it on our current flag
You don't want to go that route, otherwise some other Chad will steal your flag like it happen with Romania
Better just pays us royalties :)
Oh my god no
People do that
Like, non American people
That’s f** up
Nop
But it's expected / common that you give something at least to cover your own expense like food or cellphone bills
But salaries in Switzerland are also high
Edit: *right
Sent by mistake lol I’m on mobile
The [Portuguese water dog] And we have this symbol: [Galo de Barcelos]
Amália and Eusébio, two otters that lived in Lisbon oceanarium filled that role from 1998 to 2013
I don't think we have a pet now :(
what came to mind: [Cod]
Yes
But that one is imported from Norway
And we love our pet in more than 1001 different ways
Sometimes I hear people speaking Russian and if I don’t see their faces, I’ll immediately think it’s Portuguese
Then I realize I don’t understand any of it so it must be Russian
Funny how the easternmost and westernmost countries in Europe have such similar sounds in their languages
Portugueses is often described has drunk Spanish or Russian trying to speak Spanish while being drunk
Good question, what do you people think of Portuguese language
I've had friends describe my language, Portuguese, as a Russian man trying his best to speak Spanish but never actually quite getting it (with French elements occasionally sprinkled here and there)
Makes for great Industrial Metal tho
[This always gets linked so here it is]
I also don't think it sounds like Spanish, but Portuguese is similar to Spanish, so my opinion is also not the best
From what I understand the 'th' sound is more pronounced in southern spain making it a regional characteristic of the language in a very popular place in Europe
The English 'th' sound isn't at all regional, and is a very common sound so there really is no contrast against another English speaking place/dialect
I guess that it is why it stands out
I personally feel that the sound adds a lot richness to the language and hope that it stays dominate where it is used
That’s a very interesting video, thank you for sharing
This whole thread is just awesome
Thank you UK, for saving our asses from the French multiple times
Thanks UK for our oldest and greatest Alliance
Thanks Spain for overcoming our differences and end up "nuestros hermanos" again
Thanks Switzerland for the great chocolates and for giving my uncle a chance of having a great salary in the 60's when we earned ours penny by penny
Thanks France for hosting our immigrants
Thanks Greece for understanding us when it comes to being broke (Southern Europe rules
Thanks Angola, Mozambique, Cape Verde, São Tomé and Príncipe, Guinea-Bissau, Brazil, East Timor and Macau for dealing with us for so many years (proud of you guys
Thanks Sweden for the great furnitures
Thanks Germany for being so supportive of us
Thanks everyone else for being such great countries
Love, Portugal
I would say we learned from you, be nice to others and others will be nice to you :)
\-forever allies
Awwwwwww, stop it
We thank YOU for being such (more or less) great allies
Cheers guys
To be fair England saved our collective butts more times than we could ask for
im sorry what
Spain for seafood
I love milka
Does it count
For reference: [The Netherlands: NAC Breda honours Polish liberators]
And green wine
Aww thanks UK
Always in here ️
>Why’d you have to knock us out of the Euros tho
We heard some frenchmen going around saying they were going to win the '16 euro easily, so we had to do it ;) I've visited Wales last year and really enjoyed it, I hope I can go back again sometime
Fresh green wine at lunch is basically heaven on earth especially if you are eating sardines or light meats

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
/s XP
Same in Portugal
The outside handle isn't connected to anything
That's just an option when you choose your door
Mine can be open either side as long as is unlocked
I'm talking about what, from my experience, most people in Portugal have
But yes, the other option exists
In Portuguese:
*"Jone maide is uai tu a taverne tru de darque foreste, onli to finde oute dat i forgote de moni
Djóne meide ise uei to a tavêrne tru/fru/dru (th is weird) de darque fôréste, óneli tu fainde aute date e fourgóte de mani
I think it would look something like this, but i'm no linguist
Jone meide iz uei tu a tabern tru de darque forest onli tu fainde aut dat I forgote de manei
John made his way to a tavern through the dark forest, only to find out that he forgot the money
Jónhe maide is uei tu a táverne tru da darque foreste, onli tu fainde aute dáte e foregote de moni
>"John made his way to a tavern through the dark forest, only to find out that he forgot the money".
Jone maide his waei to a tavern frou de dark forest, only to finde oute dat hee forgote de moani
Translation:
O João fez o seu caminho pela escuridão da floresta até a taberna mas quando chegou apercebeu se que tinha esquecido do dinheiro
>John made his way to a tavern through the dark forest, only to find out that he forgot the money
Jón meide iz uei tu a távêrn frú de dárque fórest, ónli tu fáinde áute dat e fórgóte de mâni
"Djon meide is uei tu a tavern fru da darque forest, onli tu fainde aut i forgot de moni"
&#x200B;
And now you just gave me an intense migraine ahah
I would switch de for da and finde to fainde
o "e" no final dessas palavras todas é memá tuga
Its more like :
djone meide is uei tu de darque forester, onli tu faind dat i forgote de monei
e dat por det
Formula 1 GP and the terrible organization with selling tickets and seats due to Covid social distance
TL;DR: [it didn't exist apparently]
Sports
Pretty much as it always has been but fortunately now tv and radio stations are  broadcasting and covering more information about other sports rather than just football which is nice for a change
Other than that it’s just covid, domestic and foreign politics and the economy going to shit
Why is it allowed that a Formula 1 race has 27500 people watching and most of our football stadiums are empty
Coherence isn't the biggest strenght of the portuguese government by now
That is truly interesting
Yesterday on one of our TV news channel they barely scratched the protests in Warsaw, Poland only to mention the cause behind those protests to be an “anti-mask” protest (we had a large gathering of people in Lisbon this last Saturday because of masks being of compulsory use)
I find amusing how generalist news treat their audience
Like I read about Warsaw protests a couple of days ago on reddit and then on some websites and I learned the essential question behind those protests was not about if wearing the masks in public was mandatory or not
I understand that the abortion is still a delicate topic for some people in our country but concealing the truth on current events to appease certain minds is just a shame
Yeah probably a coincidence they did not mention abortion but I also learned otherwise about coincidences, that’s why it seemed that only part of the tale was being told on that tv news piece
Thanks for your input
The coimbra University is normally considered the best in general especially in law, it is actually the oldest university in the Country , and the oldest at teaching law
but the universities classic and new of Lisbon are also highly regarded in law in equal,or almost equal, footing with coimbra
Though the University of Coimbra is generally regarded as the most prestigious university, given it's the oldest one, the new and old Universities of Lisbon and the University of Porto tend to have better scores when it comes to which is "overall better". Of course, at the end of the day, it mostly depends on the field you plan to study
Ainda tens a católica, pelo menos todos os meus colegas que vão para direito querem ir ou para a clássica ou para  a católica
Comment high jack: what do you guys think about CBS
I'm going there on the 2nd semester this year:)
"Ambitious" = too hard  that will shorten my Erasmus trips through Denmark and Northen/central Europe Countries  haha but I knew what I was signing up for
I think I will, Danish people seem really nice and so does  whole country itself :)
I got that impression too, but I didn't want to go any "crappy" university for my erasmus semester, and it was  between CBS and Erasmus School of Rotterdam, but in the end I chose CBS
I think the weather might be a problem in the first few months (I will go on February) is it true
I've already gotten most of my doubts answered though, but thank you
Not even a bit
Yeah, I'm used to cold weather (my city in Portugal has temperatures that vary from ~38°C to ~ -1/-2/-3°C) so I think I will do good there
Plus I really like the rainy days, but we will see if it turns out to be a pain in the ass
Are the infrastructures for sport for example and leisure in general good for when it rains/gets cold
In my opinion every country in Europe has something interesting about it
But I really think countries in American continent are the least interesting, because their culture is mostly adopted from European traditions and they are not that much original
( Not all exemple Mexico and Peru are still fascinating)
Can only talk about those I've been to
Well, Luxembourg didn't have anything going for it, really
Andorra is cool geography-wise, as well as a nice play for snow sports
The capital, at least from what I explored was a bit meh
Didn't really feel much of an identity there
If I ever visit again I'll try and research the cultural landmarks beforehand
Every boring part differs from other boring parts
It's why I'm so interested in seeing what mundane life in other countries is like
Norway has very nice nature
A shame it's filthy expensive
Geography Now sucks
It's a channel citing the Wikipedia page of countries and still find a way of getting things wrong
TravellerTim, Tom Scott or even RealLifeLore are way better to learn about countries
Been in a trip through Belgium and Netherlands
Belgium has more personality
Antwerp and Brussels are just the two the cities I would rather live
Also they have a disproportionate good taste in fashion
The fact that it was around 20% Portuguese in 2017 is quite interesting
The "Brazillian Jesus" was a gift from Brazil to the sanctuary
It's not quite a copy
as per the bridge, it was made by an American company, so maybe there's where the inspiration came from
If you aren't a big fan of Lisbon i'd take a look at the Azores or Madeira Islands, yu can find more nature there and that i tell you for sure cannot be overated
Check the North, is quite different and more original, with more historical places, no skycrapers, green valleys and more happy culture, also azores is much different than any other place in Europe
Went there as part of a Spring Break trip (as do a lot of other Portuguese teenagers)
Liquor and cigarettes are indeed super cheap
I've never been a smoker but I almost felt like I was missing out on some great deals
Dude, if I could afford to go to Slovakia at least once a month to have Halusky, I would
Been there twice, totalling like less than 4 days in the country, but each time I HAD to have Halusky
Nobody mention about being boring, I just said why european countries and there culture are more interesting to me
If I like something more doesn't mean I hate the rest
If I wanted to meet portuguese people I'd just stay home
By that logic, you won't find the palace of the king of Thailand anywhere else in the world, much less in the Vatican
Lmao touché
Nah, the Lake District, Cornwall and Devon are pretty, and cities like London, Manchester and Liverpool are cool
Your welcome, it just sounds so rude and sarcastic, dont know why
A lot, and when I say a lot I mean it
Search for José Sócrates
There ia a scale for that
0-Very corrupt .
100- Not corrupt
Portugal has 62 points
Yeah, a decent amount, but nothing too crazy
The problem is that the justice system is litteral shit
People(including politicians) go to jail for like 3 days and then leave because a) it has a mental problem so he/she shouldnt be punished for what he/she did or b) they just payed to get out and continue the crime life
Otherwise, not so bad
In a scale of 1 to 100, Portugal is rocking a solid 62, according to some recent studies
And then there are the 'megaprocessos' (very big judicial cases involving politicians and bankers) that take more than a decade to get anywhere
Justice delayed is justice denied
Verdes anos by Carlos Paredes
A masterpiece on itself, it's also an example of what a Portuguese guitar is able in the hands of a virtuoso as we never had anymore
[This]
But seriously, maybe some fado song
In my opinion, [Bom Partido] by Linda Martini
Maybe [Canção do Mar] translates to Sea song, is our identify, the sea
Anything by Madredeus, like [O Pastor] or [A Vaca do Fogo] anything they’ve made is a masterpiece
For me, personally, it's [Haja o que houver by Madredeus] Never fails to put me in a good mood
It makes me think of a sunny morning, by the ocean, for some reason
Edit: [O Pastor] by the same group, is also incredible
On a personal note, I don't like it much
But there's no denying the mastery on display here
This is the most beautiful piece of music to ever come out of *anywhere*!
Jóhann Jóhannsson was one of greatest modern composers in the world
Bulgarian folk have the greatest voices in the world
Lisbon native here
Well, its the biggest city in the country
You can find anything you want here
As for life in the city itself
I haven't lived anywhere else to compare it to, and I don't pay attention to other people's lives
I just stay home and play videogames when I have nothing else to do
I live in Lisbon, tourism gave us many things but also destroyed the cities identity
It's not for Portuguese people anymore, we can't afford it and now looks like any other capital city in Europe
I have had the chance to visit Vienna for 2 days last year, and I absolutely loved it
I kept telling myself "I can definitely see myself living here". One thing that I loved were the small SPAR markets lol, so colorful and organized
Do you have any advice or recommendations for someone wanting to work and live in Vienna, whether for just some time or forever
Am currently unsure of my future in Portugal with a Bachelors in Business
Portugal is an island
If I'm not mistaken, a few years ago, even Angela Merkel made that same joke
Imagine this: you can only name children after your monarchs
What names do you have at your disposal
In our case, we would have:
Men: Afonso, Sancho, Manuel, Dinis, Pedro, Miguel, Henrique, Fernando, João, Duarte, Sebastião, Filipe, José, Luís, Carlos
Women: Teresa, Leonor, Maria, Isabel
If it is a boy, Duarte or Filipe
If it is a girl, Leonor
No need to imagine
That's the reason I got the name I have
You go to Santo Amaro da Oeiras and everyone is named like that
Any ruler from your country's area, even it's predecessor
Carol is a men's name
If you count  when the court went to Brazil you would have:
Men: João, Pedro
Women: Maria; Teresa
Same in Portugal, but her cousin(?) Diego speaks and teaches Spanish
from what I recall, that is
That's weird
From what I remember she just speaks portuguese in our version
I might be wrong thou
Omg daredevil with portuguese speakers is a concept i never would think of
In Portugal there's a meme tier discussion regarding two beer brands: Sagres and Super Bock
The discussion is simply about which is the superior one and "supporters" of one usually say the other one is crap
Thing is, both are pretty mediocre
There's a north-south fight where sneakers are either called sapatilhas (in the north) or ténis (in the south)
With onions and a pinch of ground white pepper it's the best way, of course
There is also a North/South divide around that
Superbock sells more in the North (and their factory is near Porto) and Sagres in the South (and their factory is near Lisbon)
And just for extra confusion, Super Bock is NOT a Bock style beer
jokes on you, my friends and I are always fighting between marina and tagus
The one thing we can agree is that Stout is better than Sagres Preta
(disclaimer: I don't drink beer, nor do I care, I just like throwing gasoline on the fire)
How is it divided
Its regional
In Portugal, we call the fruit azeitona but the tree oliveira
I prefer mine with black pepper, but I'm with you on the onions
Seems that way yes but then again, many people in Lisbon claim to prefer SB, at least in my small circle of friends/colleagues
For me both are so meh that for the purposes of a cold one after work, if there's nothing else available
whatever it's on tap right now :)
True
A SB zealot would answer that with something along the lines of "ok, fine, but Sagres is not beer
" :)
Ahaha wow, that's awesome
Nothing of the sort (afaik) but the "divide" goes something like that too
Super Bock also has the advantage of having fantastic marketing campaigns
They're not just effective, they're usually very interesting
For sure, we're not, traditionally, a beer country
This sucks for me (not a wine guy) but then again, nowadays, you can buy anything, anytime
Oof to this day I can’t even smell a marina, worst hangover of my life
Black pepper is good too
One thing I noticed on the internet was, the smaller the country, the more aware they are of other countries
Big countries tend to focus a lot more on themselves, in the news or in history classes while smaller countries don't do that as much
Is Portugal small
What distinguishes us from the rest
Oh, we live permanently shiting about our golden age on other countries
I like how it seems like we all know each other, like no joke you always know someone that knows the friend of your friend
Example: when I lived in the UK I meat a Turkish girl that did Erasmus in Spain and made a Portuguese friend, I said we all know each other, she didn't believe and told me to look the guy up on Facebook only to find out that we had 10 friends in common because we went to the same uni, another, while in the UK meat two Portuguese girls and had friends in common with both of them and they were from small villages and I'm from the city
I think is fun because you always end up meeting a lot of people, but it's also bad because it's a "small" community people talk and Portuguese people are very judgy
Film voiceovers
Smaller countries can't afford to completely voiceover a movie, so we usually just stick with translations of the subtitles
Well , Portugal once ruled the world , and has one of most speaked world languages
And of course it has RONALDO
the UK is a fairly big country though
Zebett
How long
How is your mother and father
I don't hear from them in such a long time
Oh, how you've grown up, we must have coffee some time
When will you be around Coimbra
Lately, I've been passing some time there, but I'm just always jumping to Lisbon and back
Anyways, how is your wife
Any children yet
Oh, how time flies by
Have you seen u/Jz_Ribeiro
He was just above us talking about the glorious, glorious times of this wonderful country
Do you know what he has been up to
I heard good things, good good things
Well, we all know he was never the same after the "incident", you know, the codfish incident, but still, what a wonderful soul full of life
I noticed it while interacting online with Brazilians, most of them really seem to be living in a giant Brazilian exclusive bubble
Still, I perfectly understand why that happens, their country is the size of an entire continent for God's sake
But is Hungary small
Well, I mean, hide the pain Harold is from your country
Destroyer of civilizations
Learn some real trading
Omg martcapt I haven't heard from you in so long, we are all good thanks for asking they are all fine, how's your family
I heard your sister is living in France now, how is she doing
Yeah I haven't seen him in a while actually before we use to go to Alentejo together but not anymore since the incident, poor guy was really traumatized, how is it possible to go to a restaurant and not having codfish
Shocking to say the least I would be traumatized as well
Next time you're in Lisbon just say something and we can go have a beer and tremoços, maybe a chouriço as well
Bom dia
Course he is a big meme
Baduntssssss
No, spice, suger and gold
Cause he BIG MEME
Man, you should have seen us in the 16th century until mid 20th century :)
Let's not talk about it
Shhhhhhh
Ik we started the triangular slave trade, but let's not talk about slaves here
Well, who'll carry the gold, ivory, and sugar
Although we didn't genocide too much, which is kind of nice
The only good of colonial PT considering people merchandise might be that it limited the willingness to genocide its productive "assets"
Portugal from late 16th century until mid 20th century is a rollercoaster of sad emotions that makes a grown man cri
Well your country ruined our spice trade in the east
Shut up spice trade robber
Yeah, I know
I was using the word "lightly", in a certain sense, and wasn't aiming at Spain in particular
Just that, as far as I'm aware PT never tried to exterminate locals (on purpose), probably because they were better utilized as slaves, plus they'd fetch gold in exchange for european garbage
Which is awful, but you get what I'm saying
Idk, the story of the native american "indians" and the cowboy going yeeehaaawww murder murder is my first mental image on what not to do, even in brutal colonial times
Robber of the Maranhão. The Guyanas belong to Portugal
And Japan is our trading buddy until you took it
Yeah, maybe you do have a point there, to some extent
Ahah, I don't think anyone reasonable would call the colonialism period that
You northern bastards really enjoied the Iberian union didn't you
Thanks
That's so weird
I mean, I remember while being taught about it that the teachers didn't focus that much on the brutality, but still
Don't know when Spain gave up its last colonies
Here, maybe because we still had colonies (not slavery, not for a long time) when many politians were alive, many people still have the whole thing present
Like, my grandfather lived 40 years of his life while portugal still controlled Angola and a bunch of other places
In Portugal it is for sure "Não me Toca" from Alsemo Ralph
I guess we have Coração Não Tem Idade, by Toy, but that wasn't international
The lyrics are about a guy who wants to fuck all night, but he doesn't really say it; a few years ago everyone listened to that ironically
We also have Sal Grosso, the lyrics are: "Coarse salt, stuck to the nexk, calm down"; but again that's pretty local
I don't even know what that song is
You were probably not around for Iran Costa's ["O Bicho"] Or ["Milla"] by Netinho
Or if we're being really picky about the artist being Portuguese, ["Estou na Lua"] by Lunáticos
Thanks for reminding me that shit exists :)
That song is awesome
Or "Toda a Noite" by Toy
Hell, they made it into a laxative commercial
You forgot about the real masterpiece
[click at your own risk]
> Michael Teló's Ai Se Eu Te Pego
Damn, this reached Lithuania
Portugal apologizes for Brazil, then
It is an Brazilian song, it was actually pretty popular in Portugal also
I don't know why
I didn't know that version, its awesome tho
We're talking about the same song
NOOOOOOO
That's not even Portuguese, the guy is from Angola
> I don't know why
Mostly middle aged women
That's the name
I always called it "Toda a Noite".
You mean, the PORTUGUESE overseas territory Angola
ANGOLA É NOSSA
( jokes aside, if [O Bicho] is considered Portuguese, than Lord Anselmo is Portuguese too
Yup, it's "Coração Não Tem Idade (Vou Beijar)"
ANGOLA É NOSSA CARALHO
I thought that song was Brazilian
The government is trying to build a second airport near Lisbon to help manage the traffic of the current Lisbon airport (anyone that has travelled by plane to the capital knows how small that airport is)
They started the project a decade ago (maybe even more) and they are still debating the project
Many complications have arisen, mainly due to political reasons (it has been a subject of opportunity for some political parties) and, most recently, due to environmental reasons
The new airport , they haven't decided the place to build it since the 80s
Coimbra metro
Once upon a time there was a functioning train line connecting Coimbra (at the time the 3rd biggest city in Portugal) to smaller towns to east, which was very useful for commuters
However, it was decided it would be better to convert it to a metro system
How to do it
By removing the tracks and leaving no alternatives to users
Meanwhile 2008 crisis comes along, which means no money for infrastructure and for a decade people had to use a car
Recently it was decided to cancel the plans to make it a metro altogether and the path of the train line will become a dedicated bus track
During this time Coimbra has been losing importance as a city and stagnating it growth, becoming the 4th largest city after centuries of being at the same level as Lisbon and Oporto
Well, there are A LOT, but my ~favorite~, that flies completely under the radar, it's a small playground in my city center
The conversation probably went like this:
-We should put a little playground for *little* KIDS in that garden
-Why, yes
But where exactly
-Next to that statue
-Which one
This garden has so many appropriate statues to be next to a playground for little kids
-That 19th century statue of Jupiter kidnapping a very naked Ganymede, that, for some reason, instead of making him into a teenage boy, the artist made him into a toddler
-What a fantastic idea
I am a fan of some of his architecture, can you please explain why is he disliked
Whenever they decide to make a new Lisbon airport In a stupid location there is a major world recession
The universe wants Alcochete or nothing
I mean, yes, def
is a clusterfuck
Although, I'm actually pleasantly surprised
Our energy infrastructure is not a huge disaster
Our stadiums are mostly complete and usable
We got a pretty good ID card and corresponding internet-accessible gov info/tools
But again, like someone from Spain said above:
> We only have beaches and cheap alcohol, it's hard to execute this wrong
We do not appreciate our country enough, going by this thread
It is like projects are cheap compared to everything here
Have you ever used Estação do Oriente in a cold,rainy November day
I honestly think that we underrate our infrastructure
We have one of the best roads systems in the world and expo 98 and consequently, Parque das nações area was a HUGE success, the vast majority of worlds expos become a burden to maintain and rarely see any life after the event
The main problem I have with infrastructure is the railroad system that is horrible or nonexistent across the majority of the country
I have but i pushed through the cold as i dont get to use the station often and just admired its roof that looks like palm trees made of metal
I would probably hate it if i had to use it frequently
The railway system isn't horrible, it certainly does it purpose quite well, but it could be way better
There is toilet roll everywhere, though now I think of it, not a lot of stock
Liquid hand soap for sale literally everywhere, like usual
Rubbing ethilic alcohol, 90% concentration can not be found anywhere, though you can find 96% and 70% (you can dilute the 96% anyway) in some places though not all
Hand sanitizers basically nowhere by now, I saw some mid of last week and somebody was saying they saw some some days ago
But they can not be found on stores right now
Surgical masks, basically not findable
Desinfectant sprays and such still on the shelves, maybe a bit more depleted than usual
Maybe less long shelf milk
Everything else, like normal
Yeah, you can't find anything with 60% or more alcoholic volume, and no masks either
I don't know
I've been to the supermarket the other day and didn't notice anything unusual
But let's see if thst changes in the next few days
It's particularly ridiculous in southern Europe where almost everyone has a bidet (I think)
Ah yes those i crapp CARDBOARD NOT HARD AT all tubes
Wtf do I mean by plastic yeah yeah plastic TP Tubes
Porcodio
It expresses an emotion so strong that it's a crime to say it in Italy
I like "Farfalla". It's Italian from butterfly
No deep reason, it simply sounds very nice and I think it perfectly fits the animal
All the other names are fake
Farfalla is the right one
I was having a conversation with a Russian inter student about this topic awhile ago:
He answered the Portuguese words "fogo" and "chama", which translated mean "fire" and "flame". Then I asked why, to which he responded: The pronunciation is so cool, I love saying this words in my head, they don't even sound that portuguese tho, they could be words used in some exotic place during a ritual or some shit
Possibly "Saudade", a portuguese word, with no equivalent in english, used to describe the feeling of missing someone, or something
It is the primary feeling behind Fado music
There is that Fado classic called "Gente da minha terra" (people from my land) which is about this feeling
The lyrics go like "people from my land, now I understand: this sadness I bear, I've inherited from you".
We use it like that as well
nah, porco dio isn't an expression in Portuguese
if I said the equivalent, (Deus porco), people would just get confused
>Deus porco
AHAHAHA
I imagined a pig god
Like a literal all powerful pig thing
Portuguese parents naming their kids with a female name and a male name following it (and vice versa), for example: "Maria João", "José Maria", "Catarina José", etc
I don't really like it
Thankfully, it seems to be less and less common as time goes by
Sometimes, older names are just ugly: Etelvina, Prazeres, Tibúrcio, Engrácia, Alcindo
Honestly, I'm not a fan of the misspelled English names Brazilians often pick either like Maicon or Estefáni
One of my colleagues was named José Joana
Our teacher wanted to be funny and asked him if he preferred to be called "José" or "Joana", to which he answered with a huge smile on his face: Joana
Eu sendo um José Maria sinto me bastante atacado com isto
Or having Salazar in any part of their name
Maria João is everything but ugly/bad
He would be so mocked in Portugal with that name
I thought that was short for "Charlotte".
Yes, but the list gets expanded each year, and it's not a small list of only "normal-looking" names either, there are names there I've never heard of, even outside Portugal
If you are a foreigner, you can also request a name outside the list, but it will still have to be approved
It honestly sounds more scary than it is, lol
It's not so much that they have to pick from a list, you just can't register the name or the spelling of the name of your kid in some crazy, bizarre way
It's meant to avoid having people calling their kids "Chair" or "One Two Three Four". And in the case you want a regular name, say like "José", it needs to obey Portuguese spelling rules and you need to spell it like that and not like "Jusé" or "Jozé".
However, if one of the parents is not Portuguese, they can apply to register any name they want for their kid
It still needs to be approved, but the Portuguese government is generally pretty lenient in those cases
And I believe once a name is approved, that name becomes available for other foreign parents
To be fair, this is hardly an issue, as most people have common sense and give normal, common names to their kids
I think there is an approved list of names, but then again some celebrities have named their kids weird stuff like Lyonce Viiktórya
That's definitely NOT an approved name, it sounds awful
yes, its true unless at least one of the parents is foreign
and imo that list still allows too much idiot names
Desculpa, José :'(
Conjectura: Todos os nomes masculinos seguidos de "Maria" ficam mais betinhos, com a excepção de "Zé Maria", que fica mais serrano
I mean, it's common, I just don't like it
I know that there are people who like those types of names, it just comes down to personal taste
Hey, agree to disagree
Yup, this
The list does exist, but it only serves to record which names or spellings are already pre-approved or banned, you can still apply to name a kid something that is not already there (and, as you say, there's exceptions for foreign nationals)
Also, the list also restricts some names/name combinations to a specific gender
That one exists because the father (footballer Yannick Djaló, for the ones who don't know) has a Bissau-Guinean passport, so he and Luciana Abreu could opt to name their daughters anything permitted in Guinea-Bissau, which happens to be anything at all
There are some similar to Viiktórya in there (such as: Viktoriya) so it doesn't surprise me much
Honestly, I'm sure that just like anything else, there are ways around it that people will use, too, which is why such names will end up being given anyway
Hey, I love that god
I named my cat after him
To be fair, Thor was the one who dressed up as a bride, Loki just shape-shifted
In modern history I would say the ATM
In the past maybe the passarola (the first prototype of a flying device)
The caravel which made you go *swoosh* in the sea, then the Nau(carrack) which made you go **SWOOSH** in the ocean, some rad maritime instruments which made you not get lost in the ocean and the almost invention of the first airship
the passarola, but the inventor died before making any progress
Plus, tempura
That's about it, I guess
The Portuguese caravel
Although the most used invention right now is probably the microphone windscreen
Probably the Indian Spice Trade route
Or the "Caravela" which was the boat that got to India in the first place
I would say caravels and the nautic instruments were real world changers back in the day
We invented the ATM
feels good to read football and not soccer
Yep, and the SIM card too
Now, I wonder how that would come to be
Knowing Portuguese people like I do, I'm guessing that SIM means something in English lol
Yeah I got it
This
Portugal needs to modernize its rail system, it's falling way behind other European countries
We are in a tough position since we cant really change if Spain doesn't do it at the same time
But yea, Portugal is reallllly far behind regarding the trail system
At least there seems to be a real politically will to change it in recent times
In Germany, they have a machine where you put plastic bottles in and it gives you money (cents) back to use on your next supermarket trip
^((Someone from Germany please verify this)) .
This year, in Portugal, we got about 23 machines as part of a pilot project
I personally never tried it out because the closest one is still very inaccessible
Well, we were neutral in WW2 but since we had a right wing dictatorship from 1929 to 1974, fascist is still a common insult from left wing people to anyone who don't share their views,  because it still seems strange to some that you can really be anti-fascist and anti-communist at the same time
Yeah I think it is still insulting, or at least depreciating
The most popular term here is the word “bufo” but it is an old term from the years of fascism, them “bufos” might have well been your neighbor from couple of houses down the street
Nowadays portuguese natives just use the slang word “chibos” to call out people with that kind of traits
Which is funny because a “chibo” is also a goat in portuguese
Indeed
Another thing people call each other is "Salazarista", since the dictator's name was Salazar
Thats a very disingenuous take
Although some people do use "fascist" or "Salazarista" too liberally there's no false equivalence between being right wing and fascist
It's not common to call supporters of PSD or CDS fascist
Guess that we agree then
It's a privilege
Learned two languages growing up, and it's very useful that one them allows me to communicate with so many people around the world
English goes against it's own rules a lot of the time, but overall I find it an easy language to learn compared to others and a simple one to grasp, which makes it useful as an international language
The downside is that there then becomes an expectation for people from other countries and cultures to know the language, and some native speakers become frustrated when the former don't speak it
Many native speakers also don't feel the need to learn languages other than English, and thus don't put in as much effort in communicating with non-native speakers compared to the other way around
No, but that sounds like an interesting idea
If I was a cook I think I'd play around with fusion cuisine haha
Yeah, tell me about it
In a way the Spanish have it worse
Usually things are labeled with the correct flag for Brazilian/European Portuguese (hence the Brazil flag for Portuguese memes), but it's actually helpful
Most of us would prefer English to Brazilian Portuguese as it's less uncanny valley-ish to us
Spaniards have their flags on "Spanish" because there's 30 million Spanish speaking countries and then it turns out it's Mexican Spanish
I'd rather have Brazilian flags than Portuguese flags marking Brazilian Portuguese content, to be honest
That's the first time I've seen Brazilian Portuguese described as uncanny valley-ish but it's absolutely true
Written Brazilian Portuguese is just like European Portuguese, but there's always something very "off" about it
Even Spanish feels a bit uncanny-valey-ish to me
They are just too close to European Portuguese for the differences not to feel like mistakes, especially because most of the differences feel like simplifications, so they both sort of feel slightly infantile (which is totally unfair to them, but it's hard to shake off)
I literally cannot think of a single videogame with international fame made in Portugal
Really curious to give Control a shot
Love the whole Brutalist thing they have going on in the game
Just a reminder that Crusader Kings III is out people
Also cities skylines, the publisher was Finnish but the developer was Swedish
I used to play the shit out of the Tycoon games, so much fun, as well as Theme Hospital and all the other zoo games
DiRT is more emblematic than Project CARS
There was a post on r/portugal a couple days ago about an award winning game produced by a portuguese team that's coming out in 2021 I think, can't remember the name though
Dakar 18
It was developed by Bigmoon, a studio in Gaia
Same :(
Already out ? See you in 2021 folks
Holy shit, I thought it was going to realese october
What have I done
If I knew this, I wouldn't be having a life like I'm having now
Oh great
I can't wait to go cheat on my sister with her daughter so that i use our marriage to steal their lands back from the muslim pope
It is, I thought it was the opposite for some reason
Well fuck, thanks for getting me addicted in a new game
It's in my top 3 favorite shows
I love from s1 to s3
I love the ending
Honestly the best show I saw in terms of writing
Can't believe this show isn't more known worldwide
Guess because it's not American made
However, from what I heard the experience might not be so good if you are German native speaker
They say they way the actors speak sounds too fake
I love this series, and I believe it will be one of my favourites for many years to come
Thanks Galiza for the influence you had on our language, which I consider that it is also your language
Thanks spain for your really cheap gasoline and diesel
It's worth driving the kilometers
Thank you Spain for
Uhhhhh
Holding it for 500 years without going to war with us
For
Uhhhhh
Cheap Gas
*^Do ^I ^really ^have ^to ^thank ^Spain
*^GODDAMNIT ^it's ^the ^only ^country ^we ^border
*^wait
^by ^land ^anyway
Thanks US for accepting all the illegal Azorians that would get in your boats without you noticing and only revealing themselves when they were in Boston or Jersey
*^No, ^that's ^not ^it
#God, this is hard
Thanks spain for trying to fuck us at every moment you can
Thank you Spain for
the cheap gas
Thank you US for the cool movies we enjoy without dubbing, Spain, because we're able to watch a movie and read at the same time, Spain
Also, I would like to thank Spain for helping out during our summer fires
And cheap gas
Towels
Interestingly, if you draw a straight line from New York across the Atlantic, the first country you find is Portugal
That would make us the closest neighbour across the sea
Weird flex, but ok
Here in Portugal, we have Sumol
It's an orange or pineapple soft drink with a lovely light taste
It doesn't scream "I'm fake orange" at you like fanta does
Food wise, it's one of the things I really miss when I'm abroad
They also have a zero version which is passable, although not nearly as good
And from the Azores, there's Kima, which is a soft drink in the same vein as Sumol
But instead of orange or pineapple, it's this really intense, mouth-puckering passion fruit taste
It's really tart and refreshing
Sumol
its kimda like fanta, but better and the brand is portuguese
>Surge
Wait, you guys have oil reserves and Surge
Man, I'd keep quiet about this
Otherwise, the Americans might get a little invasion-y.
Don't forget [Brisa] from Madeira
I quite like Sumol Zero, better than the original actually
And the Passion Fruit version is awesome
They need to make a Zero version of that
Laranjada (from the same company that makes kima) its the same but its made from oranges
But why does the last sip always taste like metal
Ooooh, I love Lilt
I don't really enjoy alcohol, so none of the usually iconic Irish drinking stuff (beer and whiskey) really stuck with me
But Lilt is a really refreshing flavor, and n my mind, the taste of Ireland
I remember my Danish friends bringing us cans of FK when I was younger
Personally I'm not a fan, but I appreciate the enthusiasm
A few years ago, they collectively lost their shit when FK Booster came out
It was like the second coming of Jesus
Guaraná is delicious
I love a cold can of Guaraná on a hot day
Apparently it has a lot of caffeine though (as does the actual fruit)
We also have Radler here in Portugal
They've actually spun it off into 3 variants: lemon, lime+apple and lime+pear
Oh, and there's a non alcoholic version as well
Não há pessoal a vender aí no Brasil
Olha aí o nicho de mercado
Abc
Never tried it
I'm assuming it's good
So good
Just thinking about it makes me want to go get one
Team Passion Fruit over here
Although I am not a Sumol kind of person (I know, unpopular opinion) and, even worst, I dislike Sumol pineapple (please don't shoot me), I LOVE the passion fruit version
It's the iron price
I'll let you off with a warning this time
But please remember Sumol fondly
To be fair, orange Fanta is about the worst orange soft drink I've personally ever had
See /u/perrrperrr
Now you've done it
Prepare for freedom, I guess
:'(
So long Norway, I loved hearing stories about your high rate of EV adoption
It is but I'm a suspect because I really like the passion fruit flavor
I tried it when they came over that Summer
It's not great, no
Se fores a Varsóvia há Sumol na Smaki Portugalii
Conhecias a Pizzarte
That's our secret though
You have it on the beach, so you associate one thing with another
So, everytime you see a Sumol, you're like "Man, I should go back to Portugal". And everytime you're in Portugal, you're like "Man, this beach trip really needs something refreshing
Oh, they have Sumol, perfect".
Omg a serio que isto existe
Estive 6 meses na Polónia cheia de saudades de tudo o que era português e quando pesquisei lugares portugueses, este nunca apareceu
De nada
Sumol não costuma haver no Biedronka, mas eles fazem a semana portuguesa de vez em quando e encontras produtos portugueses
No Lidl às vezes encontras carnes fumadas portuguesas quando eles fazem a semana espanhola (lógica zero)
A sério
Eu também só descobri porque uma amiga me levou lá! Achei os preços elevados mas dava para matar saudades quando não havia nada no biedronka e as coisas que tinha levado de Portugal tinham acabado
Nice, devias ter ido mais vezes, eles têm um crepe com doce de ovos e fios de ovos que é super bom
Eu estava num grupo de portugueses na Polónia, no Facebook, e eles costumavam alertar quando haviam produtos :) há pessoas em Cracóvia a guardar produtos para gente de outras cidades, por exemplo
Também é bom ;)
Eu tinha a minha própria máfia  levava produtos portugueses para aí e trazia produtos polacos para cá :)
Haaaaaate it
Yes
Even more so because 99% of the time the translation ends up being brasilian portuguese
No taboo at all to talk about António Oliveira de Salazar here
Most people didn't like both him and the life back then
If you ask anyone about it, how was life, what were the differences, even about more sensitive topics, like censorship, government police related tales, etc
, I always found everyone to be pretty open about it
No taboo at all, normally we have two kind of people who fantasize over the regime
The poor nobodies the think that we should burn or cut hands of every criminal in this country, even the guy who steals an apple
Usually the story goes " when we had salazar there was no crime and kids could play in the street" stuff like that
On the other side we have the traditional catholic rich aristochratic families, next to the monarchy salazar was the next big thing since they had money and could keep living the good life and liberals were quiet
From my experience it's not taboo to talk about the Estado Novo (the Portuguese dictatorship til 1974) at all
I mean, when Portugal did their take on "the best Portuguese people ever", well after the revolution, Salazar, the dictator, won first place
It's not taboo
We should talk abt it even more as ppl don't seem to remember famine and all that happen and support the alt right
There are people abroad who very weirdly idolise him and it's just so hard for me to understand, specially when the praise they give him is so different from the praise he sometimes gets from Portuguese people
Like this article from a while back from an American news outlet:
"Portugal's 20th-century philosopher-king may be the ideal model of a leader for our times
Yikes, man
There is one taboo that was left tho
"Right wing" is kind of a dirty word
Not really for me but this is my opinion
English, usually the translations are in Brazilian Portuguese, and I prefer in English because I learn more and get more used to it
I'm so used to playing them in English that it'd be weird to play them in anything else
If the game was undeniably Portuguese then I'd go with that
I like playing in Portuguese when it's possible
English for sure
If there's a Portuguese translation most of the time it's in Portuguese from Brazil and it's weird because they use a different grammar and it's kind of cringy to read like they are making writing mistakes on purpose and use some expressions that doesn't exist in our native language
No offense to any Brazilian but I just can't stand reading it, I would guess it's the same to them for ours written version
I prefer playing them in the original language if it's a language I understand
Sometimes translations are bad and even when they're good some jokes are lost in translation
English, always
Also, I bet that if I changed to Portuguese, it would be in Brazilian Portuguese
That shit hurts
It depends if, when choosing the language, the portuguese language appears with the portuguese or the brazilian flair
Translations are done by brazilians most of the time
Those translations are usually terrible so, when that happens, I prefer English
But if there's a Portuguese translation, then I'll play in portuguese
The original one
If made in Portuguese from Portugal, play in Portuguese
If not, english
Most of times, translations are incorrect/misleading, remove some of the jokes/puns and are often not avaliable in Portuguese Portuguese, but in Brazilian Portuguese
I hate movies with portugese translators due to the voice acting mostly cus their Brazilians who do it and the accent it always the same (IN MY OPINION I JUST DONT LIKE EM)
But I love cartoons and really any kids movies I hate the english version when I hear the portugese version the first time
(Honestly they are just seen as almost non existant)
i think we don't have negative stereotypes towards them
Actually, we have positive ones
Country people are seen as genuine and truthful people
Thats just my opinion tho
Yeah
Im from the countryside and here in Portugal we are seen as dumb, poor, stupid and lazy
I agree
People from rural regions are seen as hardworking and respectful
Even if sometimes they have poor taste in music or clothing
I mean, there are stereotypes for people who live in the north, people who live in the south (alentejo, algarve)
some make fun of the alentejo people for being a bunch of lazy farmers, it usually is just banter tho, i dont think anyone actually hates anyone
I wholeheartedly agree, people from rural areas in Portugal are seen as hardworking, down-to-earth no-nonsense people
They might not have the luxuries of a big city but they have their values right
No, unless you are from Alentejo
Sometimes close minded about some stuff, but is natural and is fascinating hearing their stories and expressions that usually don't hear
I am
Yes
Until I'm able to read all my favorite books in their original form, it will never be enough
I speak English and Portuguese, used to speak decent French too but after years of not whispering a word or hearing it I forgot most of it, always wanted to learn German but never had to chance to go beyond numbers
Bro, do you really live in San Marino
Also yes
Ahahahah
But it might work with sand
I envy those countries with proper snow so much
I've only seen snowing once in my life, and it was very weak, only lasted a short while
Nonetheless, I was euphoric and everyone else in that Viennese street might have though I was a crazy person
Snow here in Portugal only appears in remote places, where nearly no one lives, and comes in dreadful tempests and hard ice, with a touch of blinding fog
None of that soft, fluffy, pure white layers you can play with
The only one I remember was an accident in a pyrotechnics factory in Minho region in 2004
I don't know if it's the most notable but I remember standing next to one of the rocks that was thrown in the air and it was about half of my height
Edit: Apparently there was a terrorist attack in 83 with explosives perpetrated by Armenians on the Turkish embassy
Dear Netherlands,
I miss your bikes and wonderful parks
And I miss your train, you’re railway is something wonderful for Portuguese standards
Dear UK,
Can you please behave next drunk vacations
Meanwhile I miss Victoria & Albert museum still my favourite in the whole world
Dear Germany,
Your parks are wonderful and thank you for all the medical help now with COVID
We will not forget ️!
Dear Poland,
I miss soplica !!
Dear nuestros hermanos aka Spain,
I will visit you again and have tapas and sangria as much as you let me
I really like you as a neighbour history aside
Dear Spain,
Sorry for always complaining about how loud and annoying you are
Truth is, we don’t look at each other much - maybe it’s the endless centuries of rivalry and wars between us
But all that is behind us now
You guys are cool and we have so much in common
Let’s be friends
Or hermanos even
Sincerely,
Portugal
Thank you France, Switzerland and Luxembourg for receiving so many Portuguese people with open arms, and giving them a better life
Although we do have very different languages and culture, we do share those similarities you mentioned and I would like to explore them as well, I'm intrigued by your country old mythology and language
Also, your country has the best flag
&#x200B;
(Fyi, you just need to give us some cod and we will be best friends
It's ok my friend but don't let it happen again
You are welcome back my friend
We think you’re really cool too
Let’s be friends ️
My breakfast always consists of a cup of warm milk mixed with a double expresso
I won't wake up until I drink it
I don't remember the last time I've had milk
I've hated milk all my life, I only use it to eat cereal and in the end the remainder gets discarded
Yoghurt and cheese is completely fine tho
There's several: "para lá do sol posto" meaning "beyond the sunset" ;
"onde o Judas perdeu as botas" meaning "where Judas lost his boots" ;
"fim do mundo" meaning "world's end";
"no cu de Judas" meaning "in Judas butt".
I really don't know the origin of this obsession with Judas
No cu de Judas - in Judas ass
Atrás do sol posto - behind the sunset
It's got double suns, and a non-zero number of retired Jedi Masters
Fellow European Healthcare workers, how are you all holding up
I'm a General Practice/Family intern, in my final year of internship
Friday we were told we're going to do extra-shifts, our vacations were canceled
We still trying to reduce unnecessary appointments as much as possible, but we still have a lot of patients who come because they're scared of going to the ER or the hospital
I have an auto-immune disease and I'm on immunosuppressants
I have to do admit that I'm scared
How are you all doing
Edit: Thanks for the silver and all the kind words
Unrelated, but based on what you see and experience, do you think SNS is ready to take on this issue as the number of cases increases with each passing day
I hope everything is ok with you
It's not uncommon here for people to honk and wave at fire trucks when they're returning from a wildfire
Ours wasn't so bad on Friday, but we're afraid of what is going to come
Since I'm taking my Infliximab on my hometown up North, my next appointment was delayed for 3 weeks
Hang in there, Hermano/a! Boa sorte
Unfortunately that is about it
Stay at home, avoid crowds, wash your hands regularly and avoid touching your face when you touch doors, elevator buttons, etc
I was diagnosed when I was in my third year of medical school
My mother wanted me to quit, but I didn't. I worked too hard to get into college, sacrificed too much
I'm not letting a disease control my life, so I made a choice and I went to one of the fields with the lowest risk of infection
I've been on remission for almost 4 years, so I've been as healthy as my colleagues most of the time
Too early to tell, we're doing everything we can and, supposedly, we're doing it earlier than Spain and Italy, but when you still see idiots partying on bars or going to the beach it makes it hard to tell
Gracias :)
Tu também!
It would increase the possibility of a severe pneumonia from what I know
Some people only have flu like symptons, while others evolve to more severe pneumonia, lower immnunity is a risk factor
What's something other countries get credit/flack for that also exists in your country
In Portugal we have bullfighting but Spain gets all the flack instead
We also eat snails, but only the French seem to be known and made fun of for eating them
The Inquisition
We burned a lot of jews too
Nobody expects the Portuguese Inquisition
I'd say we're in the same boat on that one
That I didn't know
Some Portuguese people eat frog legs
I've never tried any, though
Really
I mean, Hitler was born in Austria
I mean our Inquisition isn't exactly unknown, it's very prominently featured in Voltaire's  *Candide*
When it comes to the Inquisition, I think the ones that get forgotten the most are the french
They're the ones that first started it
I've noticed there's a variety of how British, Canadian and Australian people mention their height and weight online
A lot of them just use metric, but justas many, if not more, use imperial
An Australian told me that Australians nowadays only use imperial for height, but I've seen Australians online state their height in metric as well so idk
Also, it seems like British people use Celsius nowadays
Do men kiss each others' cheeks as well
That's something I've always seen as a French thing
I got surprised when I was in Italy and saw guys greeting with kisses on cheeks
I'm Portuguese and I just use to greet girls this way
Dankeschön
Heute habe ich gelernt
A sério
Em Lisboa o que não faltam são restaurantes onde se pode comer caracóis
Mas talvez seja uma coisa mais regional
Se calhar no Norte ou nas Ilhas não seja tão comum
In Civ 5 Denmark gets the Vikings theme with Harold Bluetooth being their leader
I don't think Danish sounds that much like German
Norwegian sounds more like German to me
Danish has a rather distinct sound to it
The few times I've seen Canadians using metric for height and weight they happened to be from Québec
Is that a coincidence or
Well maybe I'm not running into many big history fans or buffs online, but rarely do I see the Portuguese empire and its slave trade being discussed on the English speaking Internet
That being said, it makes sense that North Americans and the English don't talk about that one as much
Well, you're the first ever person from Sri Lanka that I've encountered and spoken to in my life
Most people I run into online are from Europe/USA/Canada/Australia
Alot of Arabs and Latin Americans like anime, so I also run into them online at times as well
Most common East/South East Asians in English seapking communities seem to be Indonesians, Malaysians and Filipinos
Oddly, Japanese, Chinese and Koreans seem quite rare to find in comparison
Do they don't venture outside of their own countries Internet or something
Oh baby, I'll show you my «auto-de-fé» if you show me your «cure par l'eau» ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
It's really odd how USA never switched to metric considering after independence they wanted to be as different from the British as possible
Also od how the country that's supposed to be the representative of the Western world and the most influencial country in the world uses a system that most countries in the world neither use or understand
Gym machines all over the world list the weights in both metric and imperial
Perhaps in order to make it easy to sell them to American gyms
Ah faz sentido
Eu só comi caracóis em Lisboa e no Algarve
Talvez no Alentejo também se comam
Deve ser algo mais típico do Sul do país então.
If properly cooked, chicken is delicious
I prefer chicken to turkey
Online forums with people from all over the world
Rome please come to besiktas
Well, I think both England and Spain get the most attention and the most flack for their colonial empires and slavery
Probably because they had the two largest ones and their languages are spoken by tons of people all over the world
Don't forget there's lots of Spanish speakers in USA and a lot of States were once Spanish colonies and part of Mexico
People are aware of the French colonial empire but usually when people think of France and empires they think of Napoleon and what he did in Europe
Different from what
The American and UK based websites
Well, it's much smaller, for starters
Portugal has its websites and Brazil had theirs
The Brazilian Internet is obviously much larger since there's more Brazilians than Portuguese people in the world
I don't know what their Internet is like since I don't venture there
Interesting
Let's not blame the Straw Hats for this
Frango também se come muito em Lisboa
You overestimate the savouriness of mediocre cooking
I agree with you
And that's not the only thing Americans do that's different from the rest/most of the rest of the world
They also play sports like American football that pretty much no one else does
Japanese and Koreans play baseball but those aren't Western nations
And let's not get into USA's political system and the way they define liberalism
Seriously, for a nation that's supposed to represent the West it sure doesn't seem that representative
It feels incredibly alien and foreign, as do its practices
Even if its small things such as their date format being MM/DD/YYYY
That crap alongside their usage of imperial makes the English speaking Internet a hassle to navigate at times
>Is this only you or do Portugese and Brazilians not intermingle on the internet
I don't know what the average is like tbh
I don't go out of my way to look for Brazilians if that's what you mean
I don't use any Brazilian websites either
Perhaps Portuguese people who can't speak English thst well interact more with Brazilians online and use Brazilian websites more often, idk
Isn't ice hockey Canadian
Ice hockey is only popular in some European countries in Canada afaik
A lot of those counties where it's popular are small and/or have low populations
Basketball yes, it's a sport played all over the world
And if volleyball is American thst one is also global to some degree
I'd say pro wrestling is the most popular American "sport" worldwide after basketball
A lot of males under 40 all over the world know who John Cena, The Undertaker, Hulk Hogan, The Rock, Stone Cold Steve Austin, Rey Mysterio, Triple H, etc
are
Lisbon is probably one of the cities with fewer scyscrapers in Europe, hell i don't know if we have one at all
It may be the reasons everyone said, contrast between old and new but I think it's also because the airport is right in the middle of the city
It is complicated
It is not just about preservation though that can be pretty much a factor (see Sevilla and Dresden, where new skyscrapers off the city centre would ruin skylines and UNESCO and many locals are not pleased)
It is also a matter of urban planning
This is really hard to articulate, but if you look at new world cities which are really quite young, they might have farm land open land in many directions around, you can plan and build roads, and infrastructure in a whole recent neighbourhood without much constraints
European cities, and look at a place like Paris, or Lisbon  which can be really old, are kind of spreading from their historical centers
Even if historical centers are off limits to build skyscrapers, as you move from those centers there are other historical centers, limitations, areas which have been built long before, of villages and towns which got absorbed into the bigger city as it spread
And it has been spreading for centuries and the bits which are not developped often are so for a reason and now might be particularly cherished for environmental reasons
To build skyscarpers on existing plots with surrounding buildings, it can be pretty complex
You need to plan for acess to it - lay down maybe new electrical lines (which might not be possible or easy
It is amazing the limitations which can exist in Lisbon's historical center), water
The skyscrapers can shade nearby buildings
Roads might be too narrow to plan for access for people to actually live, or work in those skyscrapers
Prontos ou não, aqui vou eu
"Um dois tres, aqui vou eu
" (Something like  that, idk about continental Portugal or if it's really like this
(One, two three, here i come
"Caralho, aqui vou eu"
PS:I m portuguese
Preparado ou não, aqui vou eu
He is portuguese for does who didnt know
Not really, if think adapting your vocab should be the norm
Changing your accent however, comes off as very cringy imo
I would prefer if they did
I do not think, or am up to date, on all the brazillian terms
And it can be a total brain freeze if a brazillians asks me for the trem and I can not recall if they mean train or tram and both are nearby (Rossio
Also manners, I get their manners are different, but it would make a better impression if they adapted
Africans it is usually not an issue, they are very corteous mostly, but brazillians got this habit of just approaching people, using a not too polite term of address (você. Ocasionally moço/moça which is kind of like lad/lass) and asking/saying what they want, without good morning/afternoon or hello, or please, or excuse me
It might be perfectly normal in their country, but your instinctive reaction is pretty bad
I'd love so
I have no idea of what some words mean and they might sound unintentionally rude when addressing people (using *você*, for example)
If you're going to live in rome, behave and speak like a roman
If your visiting rome on vacation, no need
"Romans" may have different accents, but they all speak latin
It is as infuriating to see someone who speaks portuguese using terms that don't make sense in Portugal, or having no concept of cultural ajustment in regards to manners, as it is to see the Brits and Americans that have lived here for 10 years and don't know how to say anything more than "Olá, como estás" with a spanish accent
To that point, at least Ukrainians try to learn the language and adjust as much as they can
They could just speak english, which would probably be easier since a lot might know it already, but they don't. Because they're not dicks
I think we appreciate it if they adapt to our language, but I don't expect them to speak perfect continental portuguese either
Exactly the same with BR Portuguese and EU Portuguese
I think the word they use for flight attendant is hilarious: Aeromoça/Aeromoço. It basically translates to "Aerolass"/"Aerolad".
I don't mind brazilians speaking with their own vocabulary
Yes, their way of speaking souds rude to us, but you have to be aware that that's how they speak and that they're not trying to be offensive
It does bother me when they can't understand us tho
It bothers me even more when portuguese people (especially young people, born and/or raised in Portugal), spell words like they do in Brazil (anônimo, sinônimo, freqüente), or even use PT-BR words instead of common PT-PT words ("jeito" instead of "maneira", or  "chance" instead of "oportunidade")
Ok, but did you read the question
Moço/moça is very rural, and in that context, yeah, it is very weird
The spell word thing is probably an automatic complete thing which is loaded from brazillian examples
No portuguese person ever would try to put two dots on the letter u, like ever
I am not even sure where that is on my keyboard
... it's more annoying if they don't, except if they're tourists
I think the reply was obvious, I just went on a little tangent
No, I read your reply
I just don't think you read the question lol
It is very rural and is better avoided
It can be disrespectful particularly if addressing somebody older, and second it can have a connotation of somebody working class working a lowly job  or short for moço de recados)
And portuguese society in general maybe as reflexion of the 1974 revolution (with capitalistas, reacionários, reforma agrária, exploradores, PREC and whatever still on living memory of many many people) is pretty sensitive, reactive still,  about modes of address or other words evoking unequality or condescension from the client (like the client should not use tu form either, and not tu pronouns or imperatives also
Never give  an order on the tu form except to children or of course people you are in a tu-status with)
Use senhor/senhora, case closed, better to be too respectful than not enough
If it sounds cumbersome of person is too young, what we all do, what instutional communication is drop the pronoun
"desculpe, sabe onde fica X?"
What are some things you don't understand about your neighbouring country/countries
Spain's timezone is a strange thing to me
Only the Canary Islands share the same timezone as Portugal(well, except for the Azores)
It just seems strange that the timezone changes when crossing Northern Portugal over to Galicia or vice-versa
Spain should have the same timezone as Portugal, the UK and Ireland, but timezones aren't always 100% logical so
Spaniards, why do you dub EVERYTHING
I can't understand why you would put a dub above the original unless it's a chidren's cartoon
I don't understand Spain's need for a nap after lunch
It doesn't make sense ahahah
If the Spanish timezone confuses you, check out China's timezones
The Azores should be 2 hours difference
It's been a while but last time I saw a map with timezones the Azores were spread pretty thin in the 1 hour distance from mainland
Interesting
Maybe he thought it would make international trade easier or something
Also, apparently Portugal tried adopting the same timezone as Spain, France, Italy, Germany etc
back in 1993-1995 but people didn't like the change because it was still night time in the morning and the sun set at like 22h00
Plus Madeira was now 1 hour behind and the Azores 2 iirc
On average we have lunch and dinner slighy earlier than you guys I'd say
2PM for lunch at earliest isn't a thing here in school or at work
It's usually 12h30-13h30
we eat and do everything at the same time as you guys, but when we're eating lunch the clock says 1pm here and it says 2pm in Spain
To be fair that so applies to France, Germany and Italy
I keep forgetting Russia borders Norway
Geopolitics
Russia, specially the government feels threatened by what they see as expansion towards their borders and to what they consider to be their zone of influence
Russian geography in military terms is compromising because of how flat Eastern Europe is
As for Putin, it mostly comes down to people kinda missing the USSR, specially the older generation
They had a role in world affairs that they can't have anymore
Until not too long ago a lot of places in Portugal didn't accept card payments
Mostly smaller family owned stores and restaurants
You have specific days for Tacos
I've only had tacos once in my life
Why should they be eaten on a specific day of the week
Pizza and pasta at the same time seems odd
Sometimes two good things don't mix together
That's a lot of carbs
I'd feel bloated
What do you mean exactly
If it's our not so great social mobility then I agree
The gap between the rich and the poor here is not so good
There's 7up and Sprite, we don't need Lemon Fanta
Like wise, we find your lack of Sumol disturbing
Fanta
We do not drink Fanta
That is an American thing which tastes of rind of orange, awful
Sumol or compal or, best of all, Kima, ah Kima
Fanta, no
>without the pleasure of cold coffees
Wait
People actually *enjoy* drinking cold coffee
Without being forced
For me this is both a TIL and a TIHI
What next
Cheese with Codfish
...cold coffee
Doesn't thst defeat the purpose of coffee
That's like drinking hot Coca-Cola
>Also my girlfriend works sometimes with Germans and she says that they never want to improve something even if it the current method is highly inefficient
That goes against the efficiency stereotype
Yeah it's weird considering England's NT only won 1 tournament and it was back in 1966 already
And the way they beat Portugal and West Germany was a bit suspicious
? Sesta is a thing in Portugal too
To bring people to the interior and create a capital away from possible attacks from the sea
I was shocked to learn it's illegal to drink alcohol in public in some countries
Is that supposed to fight alcoholism
That's one of the 5 biggest countries in the world
Ofc it has various timezones just like Russia and USA do
Then we'd have to wait yet another hour for their voting places to close during elections
Some Portuguese people eat frog legs
We still have those coins here
They're indeed a pain
You know Pam, in Spain, they often don't even start eating until midnight
I remember that period
It was horrible, stupid
It was light till 23 in summer, starting classes at 8:30 in winter was even drearier
I think I can understand that
Tourism can be a kind of burden in a city or neighborhood, and a lot of tourists feel entitled to just demand help, assistance, recommendations whenever ( I got stories)
Also after a whole, there are places where rent is so expensive, everything is geared for tourists and locals just would not set feet there or know it too well
And then there is that other thing which is when tourists find good small authentic places and those places get ruined, expensive or queues or crap or usually all of it at the same time
Just do not stop people like that to ask for personal restaurant recommendations  it is a big insensitive to whoever actually lives in a place feeling tourism stress  Just do your due diligence beforehand,  and take risks, go with your instinct
Except when it's for kids, yes
Most shows and films are subbed
Most people prefer the original, even with dubs in Brazilian Portuguese
We're probably more exposed to English because of that
Also pointing out it is all those foreign police who are too brutal and do not understand how to make those delicate soulled English fans abroad behave
That's true
Spain might have a point here
I know but in Spain in some cities they close stores and universities don't have classes after lunch because people have to nap
In portugal you don't have that anywhere
Ah well I was born in 1990, so I was way too young to remember that
No wonder it changed back eventually
The sun setting at 23h sounds hilarious though
I stopped drinking soda years ago and I think I've only had Fanta twice in my whole life
I mostly drank Coca-Cola and 7Up
> skordalia
Hmmm
That
actually seems like a good combination
Lots of Garlic , olive oil and some sort of pureed base (prob
potatoes) with fried salty cod fish
I think I've got a new recipe to try on my unsespecting family this wekend (already have the cod fish, obviously)
I guess this does more than make up for the cold coffee
...........NO ONE EXPECTS THE PORTUGUESE INQUIS
Wait, that's made with haddock, not Cod Fish
Carry On, then
/actually, after my initial post I remembered that there is indeed a traditional "Tarte de Bacalhau" (Cod Pie) which *can* include cheese, though it's more usually made with cream rich white sauce
Not my favourite, by far, but with a good strongly flavoured
Açores Cheese grated coating, it's not all that bad
/^now ^I'm ^hungry
Can confirm that cutting up spaghetti is a thing in Portugal
Vespa and Lambrettta for mopeds
Tupperware for the meal plastic boxes
Tulicreme for hazelnut-chocolate spreads
Kispo for lodge jackets
Nutella for any brand that makes a similar products
Kispo - quispo - an impermeable jacket
Jeep - the type of cars that jeep does
Gillette - Gilete - razor blade
Are some examples in portuguese (Portugal)
"Maizena" for "corn flour" is a classic in Portugal
Literally no one knows any other way to call it
post it for sticky notes
bostik - for the reusable plasticine for stick things on the walls
panrico - for sliced bread
coca-cola - for coke
all stars - for the famous model released from converse
bimby - for kitchen robot
jipe - for the 4x4 car model jeep
I heard kispo is also a brand
>"taparués"
I've never heard it like this, just Tupperware with a massive Portuguese accent, especially the w turning into a syllable of its own
There's some variation in the way people actually say it, but I've never heard it without the "-re" bit at the end or ending in an S sound
As far as I'm aware, you just spell it tupperware anyway
Jipe from Jeep
Also, Jeep for that type of vehicles
And dodot for any baby wipes
Yep
Kispo for any padded winter jackets
we should start spelling it tamparuére
Want a ghost chup
Exactly, but the ones like Jeep and Land Rover
I think is written like "Jipe".
Escreve-se "taparuere"
([Fonte]
Maybe, I'm from Porto though, so not that far away
I say it like tâpâruére, with two closed As, but in my experience lots of people say tápâruére and tápáruére
Some people say tamparuére and are often mocked for it
Probably a Mediterranean thing xD
Very interesting
In portuguese we have the word "dragão" which means dragon
A kite would be "papagaio" - a parrot
Pila
Portuguese for Dick
Spanish for battery, the tv remote kind and the likes
Either way, someone's putting it in wrong and getting disappointed
A budgie is a "periquito"
German is one of the languages I'd like to learn someday, so thanks for teaching me a couple words :)
It might be, I've never heard much different
Sometimes I've seen it called "papagaio de papel" (paper parrot) as well, but "pipa" or "arraia" I've never heard before
Is there a non obvious explanation
basically anytime I went to New York and saw someone falling in tourist traps
Once in Budapest while talking to these german guys I was saying things I could say in German, I was obviously drunk and I said "Deutschland uber alles" because I genuinely thought it was part of your anthem, the guy looked at me with this annoyed look and said: "No man, cmon, don't say that" and I was a bit confused until I asked "why not, its part of your anthem" and he explained and I remembered how I had repeated it multiple times in Berlin and felt like a total fucking idiot and spent the rest of my vacation embarassed as fuck, thinking: "oh god i'm one of those tourists"
I still cringe everytime I think about this
God, I thought this was just a myth or a recurring joke we kept making, but I've actually seen this happening in a café.
I don't know where the tourist was from, as she was speaking English with a non-native accent (so she wasn't Spanish either), but she paid and said "Thank you, gracias
" when receiving the exchange, and every Portuguese around her just kind of perked up and subtly twitched
It was beautiful
España es un sifón turístico, sabes
Llama mucha gente de todas las partes
I guess that's a considerable factor too
Yep
Some people from Lisbon call the rest of the country " Província " i.e. " Provinces".
It pisses off everyone, at least in Porto, the second largest city, where I'm from
we use provincianos (from the province) to describre the ones who live out of the city
However Iove the word people from Madeira Island use to describe the ones who live out of Funchal (the main city of the island) :vilhão
Azores here
That is regarded as a PALOP in Lisbon standards
ahaha
As we say, I've been very happy at Peso da Régua !
We call you cubanos
Cheers from Madeira
To be honest, the name doesn't come from Porto either eheh
Portus Cale was the roman name for the harbor at Gaia, a city that lies on the opposite river bank of Porto
As we do, we just started calling the northern bank of the river Porto, which means literally Harbor
If Silesia thinks every idiot comes from Warsaw they should see the type of idiots Warsaw imports from Radom
Why, though
You are the ones stuck in an island, trying to get to the mainland
You're a bit confused
The harbor (both sides of the river) was Portus Cale (Harbor of the Cale people)
Later Vímara founded Porto, naming it so for the harbor and then founded Gaia, naming it New Village of the Cale
The idea that Portus Cale meant "Port of the city of Gaia" is totally unfounded
They were just named after the same Celtic people
Nobody is stuck and nobody wants to go to the mainland honey
you’re the ones that are stuck in a rectangle trying to come to the tropical island with no corona
You think we’re in some kind of sick competition with Azores
They’re beautiful
Please go visit
:) Also, please find something useful to do rather than answering to a 83 day old comment
I never had any embarrassing experience, but it has happened to me A LOT
Specially in Europe, there are portuguese people everywhere
The cities where it happened the most were Paris and Geneve
In Geneve, I literally went A HOLE DAY only speaking portuguese, and I didn't intend to do it
I managed to get a portuguese tour guide in a museum, a portuguese employee in a store, and portuguese Waiter at lunch (Italian restaurant), dinner (fondue restaurant) and at an ice-cream shop
It was a really weird experience
I went to London in a school trip
We were a big group and the only other person in the subway was a guy making his own cigarette
We, as the dumb middle schoolers we were, decided to grab a speaker and started playing a song about losing your weed
We were all laughing, thinking that he didn't understand us
We were about to leave the train when our teacher asked him, in Portuguese, where some place was
He responded but didn't say anything about our song
We all left the train quiet and embarrassed
My family was the one who heard someone else
My family came to visit me in Poland and I took them to Warsaw's old town
My dad is admiring the palace and of a sudden we hear "have you taken the picture yet
" to which someone replied "I would but this fat fucker won't get out of the way
". My dad turns around without missing a beat and says "the fat fucker would have moved out of the way if you had asked
I've never seen someone get so red and speechless so quickly
Not me, but while on the bus in Belgium (flemmish speaking part) there was a young man in the very backseat of the bus explicitly talking about how he had sex with another man the previous night in my mother language (portuguese) and he also had the other person on speakers so I could hear the whole explicit dialogue between them
Pretty awkward ride
Here in Portugal, you can take German in secondary education, so it's not as uncommon as you might think
In addition, Portugal has a [german school] which offers comprehensive education, so there's a lot of upper-middle class people that go there
Edit: Why were you talking shit about Portugal
I mean, there's a whole bunch of possible reasons, but I'm just curious
Naaa if you go to Luxemburg, it's can happen like that very often and I'm not joking
Is that song possibly the "Ganza na areia" meme
Yeah, I believe you
Literally 1/3 of the population of Luxembourg is Portuguese
And this is why I never go anywhere anymore without wet wipes
Well, that and the kids
As someone who talks shit about Portugal a lot, I agree with you
However, it is extremely disheartening for young people to see that if you're working in Portugal, you are often (in European standards) not making a lot of money
And seeing that there's one set of rules for common folk, and another for the rich and politicians also doesn't help
You are Portuguese, you are supposed to talk shit about Portugal
Unless, of course, an outsider talks shit about Portugal
Then, suddenly, we will all defend it till death
(however, stating the obvious, that salaries here are low, doesn't qualify as talking shit
Completely agree with you
Everytime a foreigner starts talking shit about Portugal, I can feel the spirit of PORTUGAL CARALHO rising
We get that a bit
It's mostly people who went away for a year, or a couple of years
When they come back they're all like "Fuck, Portugal's a pigsty, I forgot how behind the times everything is
How do you stand it
". It's really annoying, to be honest
I always find it fascinating because one of the reasons why we don't move forward is because such a large part of the active population moves abroad
Spanish people, specifically Spanish women dress very smartly everywhere they go
The French are smart dressers too but, not as smart as Spanish
Swiss and German are casual dressers like the Portuguese
People from Moscow are so good looking I never noticed how they dress
The only think that I've noticed hasn't much to do with the clothes themselves but the way people treat their bodies
South Europeans tend look more like they workout, pay more attention to make up, hair style etc
Things to do with their body
I think this is because of the weather
Most of the time you're going to be showing a lot of skin, so it makes sense to worry more about this kind of stuff
Edit: for example, here in Portugal there's some social pressure to not look too white
People will comment a lot on your appearance of you have no tan at all
So people put an effort to have at least a little tan
I don't see this being a thing in North and Central Europe
From reading the answers, it seems I might be the odd on out
I dress normally to go out
At home wear pijamas/loungewear all the time unless I'm going out in the next 20 minutes
I like to be comfortable
I have to wear several layers of medical grade compression (legs and arms) and so once I get home I immediately just want to be as comfortable as possible and just change into pjs
Whenever I feel like it, I just drive 80 miles and have lunch in a seafood restaurant in Spain
Then I come back home
Unfortunately,  we can only make this trip to Spain because it's our only land border
No ID shown, no customs, no nothing
We just cross a bridge or get a ferry to the other side of a river
Well, as an example, our gas here in Portugal costs more than if you buy it in Spain
Most people that live close to the border prefer to go fill in the tank in Spain than here
It's really usual for portuguese people living next to the border to go for fuel in spain because it's way cheaper
As a Portuguese person, there is only one terrestrial border so the obvious answer is Spain and before the pandemic you would cross like nothing
Usually I do those trips just to refuel (Spanish fuel is much cheaper then ours) and for visiting Seville or Merida whose cities are close to the border
As I live right in the down corner of Europe the only country that I can go easily by car is Spain (1 hour driving to Galicia)
This year due to the pandemic, borders were closed between March and June, but now there is free traffic again
In average, once in a year I like to visit one country somewhere in Europe, depending on the cheap flights I have available
Luckily, right before the pandemic, I had the opportunity to visit Austria in the beggining of the year
To Spain, normally I go 2 or 3 times a year, most of the times spending one day or two somewhere in Galicia (mainly Vigo), but this year I didn't have a chance to do that unfortunately
But still, this is me who lives in the extreme southwest of Europe
I have family living in Switzerland or Luxembourg and it's completely different, they cross borders almost in a daily basis
I have to say that I am 29yo and I don't own a passport
Never needed it and I live in France, 5km away from Luxembourg and 5 away from Belgium
I enter and leave normally without any restriction (this in normal times, not with corona thing)
And yesterday I went to Germany to do some shopping
Ah and I went to Italy by car last week to visit my bf's family
We crossed Switzerland and nothing was asked either
Edit: oh and I'm portuguese, I emigrated here 3 years ago
Im from Portugal and I could just cross the border to Spain by going through it haha
I live close to the border, and could basically walk into Spain without anyone noticing or even caring
People routinely drive into Spain for fuel or gas (which is cheaper) or for groceries (some are cheaper, some are not)
I've had friends living in Spain, but working in Portugal that would pass the border back and forth everyday
As long as you stay inside the Schengen Area, it's like you were going from state to state there in the USA, only people speak different languages in each one
Before the virus I's say it was pretty common for having traffic between the borders, I'd always see few Spanish license plates and if you were close to the border, crossing it to go to the nearest gas station would save you money since it's cheaper there
I remember being in vacation in Monte Gordo, near the border and crossing it casually to a nearby Spanish town to pass the day or in the North of Portugal, where it was yo Tui, Galicia instead
The schengen area is quite crazy, you can be driving and not even notice you crossed borders and now you're in a completely different world
It isn't uncommon for us to take a day trip to Seville
I'd probably go to Spain if I lived a bit closer to the border, because as it right now it's a bit of a hassle
Every time I go to Algarve, it seems like a different country
I took a flight from Liverpool to Dublin a few years ago and got the "city bus vibe" from most people
The only word that comes to my mind atm of having made me slightly surprised is ***soutien*** that means *bra* in portuguese and *support* in french
Maybe I found it funny imagining the producers wanting to make it sound fancy, but direct to the point
These are only from the North, due to English immigration: soquete-small sock, aloquete-lock, locket, tótil-totally
ooohhh, there goes my imagined brainstorming meeting
Excluding mirandese cause it’s an oficial dialect
Maybe Spanish or French
Se tiveres aprendido uma lingua latina antes, tens uma vantagem para aprender Português.
I agree with a lot of what you said but I would encourage you to go to uni, you will probably find like-minded peers
Uni learning is worlds apart from school learning too
Any lecturer worth their salt will be super happy if you are as clever as you say you are
Plus if you get in with the lecturers they will be a track you can take to do the awesome things you want to do
It's decriminalised, here, which is perfect
The interesting thing is that you don't really see/smell it around
What is sometimes noticeable is the smell of smoke on someone's clothes, but it's quite rare (relative to tobacco)
The thing we've had here is: before decriminalisation drugs were a huge problem, people were taking them for all sorts of reasons
Nowadays, after the law's passing, consumption has decreased immensely
Very common between university students
It's everywhere and almost everyone below 25yo has smoked it at least once
In Portugal it is not legal but it is decriminalized so you won't go to jail if you get caught
Hash is more popular and cheaper here
But last year there was a big drug bust operation and now my friends say it's getting harder and more expensive to buy at least here in the North
Very very popular
Smoked two this morning already, but here we smoke more hash
Everybody smokes
I don't, which is hilarious, because I was actually named after it (I'm 40, and my dad still smokes)
Well Idk about you but I used to smell it around all the time when I was living in Lisbon
I agree with the rest though, and it might just be a Lisbon thing
I don't think that the decriminalization method is perfect, I mean, it was the best solution at the time but right now we are losing a big opportunity
Remember the drug problem that we had here wasn't due to cannabis but heroin and crack/cocain
If we legalize (cannabis) we would give way better support and access to users, by doing that everyone would be more informed, the money made from it could be invested back on education and the healthcare system
Portugal has a good climate to produce cannabis, specially if compared to other european countries, we already produce it but for foreigner companies
Apart from that, this legalisation could attract younger people to farming and smaller areas of the country, repopulating them
Tons of new business could emerge from that, using hemp to produce fiber, materials to build housing and even transform the local gastronomy
Adoro como os comentários aqui são todos de portugueses mas é só grandes testamentos em inglês
I'm from Lisbon, I just don't go near the *Baixa* area that often
Neither that nor like *Cais do Sodré* and so on (places full of people at night, you know
I agree that, there, yes, it does smell a little, but it's not really that spread out, I mean, you don't really smell cannabis in other parts of the city that often, at least I don't, but I do always have a runny nose :)
Yes, of course, I meant "perfect" as in "I don't have a problem with it, I actually do support it" :) .
And yes, legalisation should be something we should strive to, of course, I'm all in with you
No, people do smoke tobacco, here, not as much as I’ve seen in other European countries, like Spain or France, though
It’s just much more common to smoke cigarettes than to smoke cannabis
It’s easier to get (and legal to buy, btw) and much like tobacco, it gives sort of a bad impression
Tobacco is much more well accepted and it’s disregarded as something harmless, which is a shame
It’s much less of a problem in younger people, but still, [studies] found that about 10% of 15 year-olds are “regular tobacco consumers”.
Oh yeah, it’s definitely only in certain areas, especially the ones you’ve mentioned
I used to smell it mostly in some parks (not even secluded ones either, near pretty busy areas) but you’re right, it’s definitely not in every part of the city :)
I feel people are smoking less tobacco in Portugal
At least my group of friends and acquaintances that were heavy smokers no longer are
I used to smoke too and I quit :)
Congratulations
Well what I’ve seen is a transition from cigarettes to Iqos, those heated tobacco devices
Yes
Even though we have a list of official names, it is very extensive and accepts multiple spelling variations for the same names
This is due to official spelling changes through time, as well as immigration
Sometimes the change is as simple as a diactric change (a/á/à/â/ã) and sometimes letters are changed
Tiago/Thiago, Filipe/Felipe, Adriano/Adrián, etc
there's also Dupond & Dupont
This is mostly due to official spelling changes through time
We do get a lot of weirdly written names from Portuguese speaking immigrants thought
We also have "Davide" and "David"
That's not completely true
The names you mention (all the second examples) are not possible to give to a child of two Portuguese parents, and can only be chosen if one of the parents is foreign and they provide examples that the name exists in their original countries
All other cases must pick from a list of names where spelling is consistent
Spelling standards evolve with the time, and famous dead people have their spellings change: "Luís de Camões" was originally spelt like "Luiz de Camoens".
how would you pronounce Arletta and Arleta differently
do you mean people tend to write down her name as Arleta instead of Arletta
Regardless of how, the reality is that those names exist in the country, and that is what the question is about
Yeah, that's true, but it's honestly a rare-ish occurrence
That is not my experience
When I was in school, I always had someone with a non standard spelling in my class
And I have several colleagues at work with alternative name spellings as well
And most of them were born in Portugal, but don't ask me how that happened
I literally never had it happen until I started working
Maybe there's less immigration to my area, that would make sense
Not native but the classics that I usually spot are:
"Did you saw that"
"Me and my friends"
"A lot of persons"
"To who
"To *whom*."
"Oh, I'm so sorry, my English is terrible
Caminho de ferro or ferrovia in Portuguese (ferro means iron in Portuguese)
So, iron path pretty much
*Caminho de ferro* and *Ferrovia* both mean Iron road
*Linha de comboio* can also be used and it translates to Train line
"Linha férrea" in Portugal with the 1st meaning is "Caminhos de ferro"
Steel is Aço not Ferro
but yeah sounds cooler
Not really
Most of the country is rural but still you can find a house almost everywhere
Alentejo is our region that is less populated but still almost every mile you cross at least you see a house
Yes, but that is because people avoid building houses close to railroads whenever possible
And there are trees and walls protecting houses when not possible
At no point you were ever more than a couple km away from the nearest home
A Finnish forest is like space
No one can hear you scream
as long as it is someone who follows Portuguese culture I think it would be just a little trivia fact about the president
if it were basically a foreigner holding Portuguese nationality it would be seriously controversial
We might have had it
I can think of at least one sovereign queen born in Rio de Janeiro
And there might have been others during the republic, I have no idea
It would not a big deal, as you can see from me having no idea about others
edit  - this made me go look, and found another one born in Rio de Janeiro
and the first two presidents of Portugal were azoreans, I did not know that
Portugal already had 60 years of Spanish Kings and it didn't turn out so peaceful after all
> if it were basically a foreigner holding Portuguese nationality it would be seriously controversial
It would also be inconstitucional
As our constitution does not allow for foreigners that hold portuguese nationality to be candidates to the presidency
- vide art
122
º of the constitution - it expressily states "portugueses de origem", excluding all portuguese that have acquired their nationality later in life
There are a number of high political offices that have the same such requirements, actually
most of your country is Germanic though
Visão Júnior
Slowly creating sleeper agents for the revolution
One day the 12 year olds will rise and take over, forming an alliance with the grandmothers that read Caras
Stop it guys, you’re killing me
England - Castile was trying to invade Portugal with France's support, so we made an alliance and pushed them back
England was also an enemy of Castile and the Lancasters wanted to place one of them on the Castilian throne
The Treaty of Windsor was signed in 1386 and established a pact of mutual support between the countries
It's still active to this day and was used during the Napoleonic Wars, WW2 and the Falklands war
The alliance might go a little further back, during the Siege of Lisbon in1147 when English and other northern European crusaders – en route to the Holy Land to participate in the Second Crusade – stopped and helped Portuguese King to conquer the city from the Moors
England
helping with the reconquista and kicking the asses off kingdoms that would become Spain and later actually kicking Spanish ass
From our point of view, France and Spain seemed like they were old buddies
They kept teaming up
So you guys were Team Tulip
The ruler of Portugal at the time was the King of Spain Phillip II due to the succession crisis we had which ended up uniting both kingdoms under the Iberian Union
So I would wager that we didn't actually fight them and that we were actually being liberated by the English, we were forced to being under rule from a foreign power so that's why we were on opposite sides
Oh and BTW that union fucked Portugal a lot making us lose a lot of possessions to the Dutch and contibuting even more to the Spanish hate (not like we ever liked them but it got worse) that eventually lead to the Revolution of 1640 ([ in which the English came to our aid again and we kicked some major Spanish ass
I've recently read a book on the evolution of Horror and the Gothic stories written by Protestants during 17th and 18th centuries display this hatred for Catholics very well with stories about priests and Catholics committing rape, necrophilia, incest, etc, here's a quote:
"While horror may thus seem graphically to reduce the body to its material, a historical basis, it is important to remember that the way in which it does so is always historically defined and culturally specific: perceived as a threat to the process of national, Protestant identity-formation in the 18th century, Catholics in early Gothic fiction become the objects, sources and causes of horror par excellence

Our first king's father was from Burgundy, so thanks for that
Nice guy, very honorable
I'm yet to enter a Primark shop
You just see large crowds of people entering them on a daily basis and being given bags by people at the entrance or wtv the hell that is
It kinda creeps me out, to be honest
Sarcasm, word play, sexual innuendos and really self deprecating
So much that our jokes rarely involve foreigners but our own people,  from different parts os the country
Bacalhau (codfish), francesinhas and president Marcelo
I’m alentejano and I confirm this
Honestly yeah
Most countries in Europe seem to have dark, sarcastic, and self-deprecating humour
It's just the language barrier that makes it hard to notice
Our minister of health started crying recently during a speech about an institute that's part of the Portuguese National Health System
[video here] It's a sad video to watch and it's clear that she's exhausted and she's under tremendous pressure
I personally think she's doing the best she can with limited resources but people forget that it's a person in that position and are quick to dehumanize her
Edit: there's also a few years ago when Passos Coelho, our prime minister was interrupted by people singing the song about the carnation revolution after his austerity measures and overall cuts [video here] (starts at 0:25)
our health minister cried a bit last week but it was not a breakdown i think
However her office must be really on the limit
The health minestry is difficult for itself but this is just another level
I think the health secretary also cried last summer on the first day in months without covid deaths, which was clearly an escape because we all knew that it was not the end
I don't know if I should call it a nervous breakdown, but our infrastructures minister is completely batshit crazy and has anger issues
Every time he opens his mouth, he speaks has if he's about to punch the listener
[Here] he is saying that we shouldn't pay what we owe other EU countries (in the time of the crisis)
He says stuff like "The Germans and the French will tremble
I don't give shit  if they call us irresponsible
We have an atomic bomb to blow in the face of the French and the Germans
We don't pay
[Here] you can see how he answers another MP
Sarcastic, aggressive, threatening
This guy belongs to the party that ruined Portugal in 2008/2009 (which is in power again) and is the minister overseeing the TAP (plane travel company) crisis today, which will surely bring us back to 2008 numbers
This is why Portugal remains miserable: people keep voting for these retards
After atching that video I now understand why swedes call a argument that leads nowhere a “polish assembly”, it makes perfect sense
I was just reading some comments on the first video and god damn, people are ruthless
It always baffles just how arrogant some people are, sure governments do mistakes, they're humans after all, and there's a lot to hate but a so many people often act like they would run the country better while not even grasping the responsibilities and duties of governing millions of people
Don't forget the time the Prime Minister freaked out on a guy who said he was on holidays during the Pedrógão fires
Edit: [here (starts at 0:26)]
How did I not know about that second video
It gave me chills
You seriously post videos posted by a political party to talk about "nervous breakdowns"?? Please keep the libertarian propaganda in r/iniciativaliberal and r/Portugal
"Coutrim makes Pedro Nuno Santos go furious" it sounds like the shit "Feminist DESTROYED by FACTS and LOGIC" videos
If you want to talk about allowing TAP to go bankrupt go somewhere else
Lol not to mention the absolute smackdown Pedro Nuno Santos gives Coutrim in the second video lmao
"People pooling in their resources to help others in their community is a good thing, people pooling in their resources to give them to private medical corporations is not" - This part is gold, but I digress
People are cowards
that was the first it came to mind
Ah yeah I totally forgot about that, he almost punched the guy in question, post the video if you can
Is it a lie
Do you seriously think this man is acting accordingly to his position
I don't care where it comes from
This is not how a MP should behave
It's common sense
Edit: it's not propaganda
Only one of the videos is from Liberal
And I don't see how it's propaganda anyway
Am I trying to convince Europeans to vote Liberal in Portugal
And libertarian is totally different from liberal
Do you know that Vince McMahon meme, the WWE guy with all those face expressions
Well that’s me figuring out these stuff
>This is not how a MP should behave
It's common sense
It's a heated debate, I take it you haven't seen many debates if you think that that is agressive, maybe he was a bit rude, but so has your party been on multiple occasions, especially when it comes to your marketing campaign
What do you mean my party
I just chose the video dude, I didn't even see what channel was from
I just searched for videos with his name and title
This dude has behaved like this multiple times
These are 2 different videos, from different channels, many years apart
You're speaking like a fanatic
If it makes you feel better, I don't think IL outdoors are very tasteful aswell, but this is beyond the point
This dude acts erratic and there's no denying it
There's a small border town in Spain called Olivença (Olivenza in spanish) that used to be ours and according to a treaty from the XIX century should still be
Despite this border conflict, no one in Spain or Portugal really cares about it, and over time it became a meme
The joke consists mainly in saying that Olivença should be portuguese and that one day we'll invade Spain and reconquer it
There is even a romance and a drama play called "A Reconquista de Olivença" (The Reconquest of Olivença), that uses this meme as a metaphor for freedom, dreams, the future and the way we are governing the country and educating the youth
The justice system
Angola is ours
Marcelo is omnipresent
There's a saying about our former President Mário Soares: "Deus está em todo o lado, o Soares já lá esteve
" (God is everywhere, Soares has already been there
) I think we should add "e Marcelo já lá voltou" (and Marcelo has already come back)
Honestly I have a really hard time finding news in languages I understand for the whole continent
I follow Portuguese the closest, then British, then EU, then Spanish, then the rest
I’d love to know what’s going on in Estonia, Denmark, France, etc
but I can never find any sources that cover those places in languages I understand
I also despise the fact that 90% of “international” news sections are just whatever ridiculous thing is going on in America at the moment
True, but the other people have their fair share of idiocy too, albeit far smaller
The two party system is in itself a joke
Urban beach
It's a nightclub that you have a pretty good chance of being beaten up by the bouncers and there are rumours of human trafficking
Wow that would make a really good movie set
You can legally drink in Portugal once you turn 16, I believe
At least that was the case back when I was a teenager
You could legally purchase beer from a supermarket but not enter bars
Also, I remember a lot of people aged 16-17 back then going to nightclubs already
That being said, I remember a few kids from my class bragging about drinking alcohol when they were 12-13 still
And by the time you're 14-15 you're considered lame if you haven't tried alcohol yet
I didn't start drinking until I was 20 or so, which is considered VERY LATE
The part of Portugal I live in (Ribatejo) drinking is just a part of culture
First time I ever tasted alcohol, it was Port Wine, I was maybe 6-7
Most people I know already had drunken experience at maybe 13-14
Drinking isn't something cool kids do, it's a thing most do, cool or uncool
It's kinda sad but oh well
Alot
At around 15, sometimes 14 i ca clearly see that people have tasted alchool and drink it in a "regular" basis
Same in Portugal atleast where I live
That was the old law
Now it's only at 18 you can legally drink
It's illegal to sell alcoholic drinks to a minor in Portugal
I don't think it's illegal to buy them, but I'm not completely sure
He is talking sh*t(censoring for the kids who may be browsering here) That was the old law
Now it's only at 18 you can legally drink
Easy there, pal
I wasn't aware it was 18 these days
When I turned 18 about a decade ago it was still 16
So it's not like it's something that changed 50 years ago
suck my pila
From far-right Salazarists to communism, Portugal has it all
So, here's a [Wikipedia Link] there are 230 Deputies in the Parliament, but let's go from Right to Left:
CHEGA (Enough) \[1\] - Far-Right party, that has inconsistent policies, which is incredibly populistic and seems like it's trying to bring fascism back
Economically Right-wing unless they think that would be unpopular in that specific occasion
They only have one loudmouth in the parliament, but they seem posed to become the third biggest party eventually
CDS (Christian Conservatives) \[5\] - They are the standard conservative party that also panders to Catholics
Economically Right-wing
Dying party, probably going to be eaten by CHEGA
IL (Libertarian Party) \[1\] - Big fans of privatization, whilst being in favor of legalization of prostitution and drugs, standard libertarian stuff really
It has got only one elected Deputy
Maybe it will survive CHEGA, but it won't grow that much
PSD (Social Democrats - Center Right) \[79\] - Center party which becomes sort of a center-right party when it's forced to work with the parties to its right, at the moment it's the second biggest party and it probably won't leave its spot any time soon, still, it's being eaten by CHEGA
PAN (Green party) ~~\[4\]~~ \[3\] - Environmental party, doesn't hold an economic identity, it grew in the last election, maybe it will grow again
I'd wager that it probably won't, as every party seems to have gotten the global warming memo, but hey who knows, this is the most boring party to talk about by far
PS (Social Democrats - Center Left) \[108\] - Center party which becomes sort of a center-left party when it's forced to work with the parties to its left, at the moment it's the biggest party and it probably won't leave its spot any time soon, seems like it's growing and becoming the dominant force for at least the next decade if these trends are anything to go by
~~Livre (Europhile Left) \[1\]~~ \[0\] - Used to be a Left wing party that was Pro-Europe (they usually aren't), with all of its liberal and general left-wing economic ideas, but it kinda elected the most incompetent politician to ever hold office, she didn't know what her party's positions were, she didn't deliver the documents in time, she asked police to protect her from being asked questions by the journalists so her party threw her out, and her party has now no role in parliament, she's a free agent, and the party will probably die
Cool stuff, nice fun drama
OV (OG Green Party) \[2\] - They used to be the green party, until the new cool green party came, and now they are forgotten and dying, sad stuff
They should be gone any minute now, almost no one knows this party exists, they are always in a Coalition with the Communist Party, people think they are voting for the Communists, but surprise, a party you didn't know about is now in office
By the way, this one is the most boring party to talk about, I just forgot this one existed whilst writing the thing for PAN
BE (Left Bloc) \[19\] - A bunch of left-wing parties combined, with all of the general left wing economic and liberal ideas
They seem to be surging somewhat, absorbing the old dying commies
PCP (Communist Party) \[10\] - Left Wing economically, right about center in terms of liberal ideas, with an aging population they should be irrelevant in a few elections
&#x200B;
As for Pro or Anti Europe, every party from CDS to the former Livre is Pro-Europe, the others are Anti Europe
Don't you find that somehow undemocratic, since not every option is the same
In Portugal,  there is one ballot given at the polling station where every party that is running to the polls appears
You just make a cross in a square in front of the name of the party you want to vote for
For the ones not paying attention, Salvini is the 'italy is in need of a mass cleansing, street by street, quarter by quarter' guy
I wouldn't say that Chega is posed to be the third biggest party for a long time, imma be honest
They seem to be holding on to new fascists (of which there aren't that many) and to older people, unhappy with CDS's and PSD's  policies
But they crumble under the minimum civilized talk, it's all the gypsys' fault, those or immigrants
Much like PAN, I'm certain that they won't be growing for long
As for BE, I wouldn't say they're and have been absorbing communists (that sounds yummy)
They're mostly holding on to younger people with very consistent social priorities and not very developed economic thinking
And PSD is definitely not getting completely eaten by the fascists
Edit: sad u forgot my boi Santana Lopes :'(
Bem resumido, mas esqueceste-te de glorificar o nosso futuro lorde supremo o Exmo
Doutor André Ventura
Advice: better go to the sub's main page and pick a flair, much like my own, for us to better identify where you're from :p
Especially with PSD going more to the center thanks to Rio's weird leadership, giving those on the right wing of PSD no ground to stand, and with BE's future limited success, thanks to PS's success, I'd say CHEGA will gain the eventual third place
I'm obviously not happy about it, and I'd really like to be wrong on this
I don't mean that old commies are going to support BE, what I'm saying is that as old commies die, younger people (unfortunately) tend to choose BE over PCP, so PCP's irrelevancy is inevitably
And ya boy has no parliamentary representation, so he is irrelevant
Fica para a próxima, quando ele colocar aquela lei em que eu não posso falar mal dos polícias, dos juízes, dos guardas de prisão e provavelmente dele
Aí falarei bem do homem, porque assim a lei me diz
I see how it could be troublesome
In here we just vote for a party, wich means we
can be voting for whatever aparitchik that stands in #27 on the lists
I buy as many products as I can from my home country, using online shops (I am living abroad)
I feel I am doing my little bit to contribute to our economy that way
É justo
It translates to "Its fair", and its meaning is something like "ok, fair enough"
I would say “tá certo” which means you’re right/it’s right
>out of a pre-approved yet very comprehensive list
that list is too much comprehensive and it's kinda bullshit foreigners are allowed to write "alternative" spellings of Portuguese names
Oh God
I'm portuguese too, nothing to add to the question itself, though
Damn seeing so many people with regular full names
My parents decided to max it out at 6 (2 + 4 family names)
7 words total with the "de" ("of") in the middle of it all for good measure
It's a pain in official forms where you can't shorten it and it barely fits
Happy for the limit though
They tell the sad story of having to leave out 3 names they wanted to further shove into my poor person
Although it would feel weird if I had to change it for nationality reasons
Just FYI, the rule is 1-2 given names and at least 2 surnames (4 tops), so the child can chose which to use
They don't have to be the parents surnames
They can be a great-grand-parent' surname, a parent's given name, a place or profession that has to with the family, and so on
We have the most liberal naming conventions in the west
I moved from Portugal to Belgium a few years ago
It's common here to have more than 3 names (I know people with like 6 names) . Normally it's just a first and second name followed by mother's and father's surname
I don't know why but it's nearly impossible for university and administration staff to understand how my name works
In university documents they consider both my mother and father name together as my first name (no idea how that happened)
I had to go to the hospital and they would call me by my second to last name
In the gym my second name was forgotten
Somewhere else my first and second name were joined and become my first name
From that viewpoint, why doesn't Spain take responsability for their massacres in the Caribbean and South America
Or even my country for the massive amounts of Africans we enslaved
Because Colonial pasts are a problem in Europe
If you stop and look at the numbers, almost every European country that had a prominent colonial past doesn't acknoledge any past war crimes
Germany took action with the holocaust because it was a highlight, the freakin' second world war, man
The eyes of the world were turned to Germany and her allies in the 40's. They were either (most commonly) viewed as "The Evil Villain" or, in the case of Italy and Japan, "The Great General". There were WAY too many witnesses to Germany's war crimes to just cover it up
In short: ***If it's abroad, doesn't matter

If you had been born 200 years ago, what would you be doing in 1819
If you had been born 200 years before your actual birth, what would you be doing in 1819
Would you have been a farmer
A soldier
In my case, I have an autoimmune disease, so would have been dead
Thank you 21st century medicine
What would have been your fate
I would be a farmer, stuck in a marriage arranged by my parents and pregnant with my 9th son at 25
And since I wouldn't be rich enough, I would be working even with a huge belly
If I didn't die at birth I would probably be an emmigrant
My origins are mostly from the coastline, I would likely start working as a fisherman or some docks
There weren't a lot of factories in my area back then
By 1819, the country had been through 3 invasions by Napoleon and the countryside was economically devastated
A huge percentage of the population ran away to the colonies on whatever boat they could find
I would likely be one of them
Probably working in some huge farm in the middle of nowhere in Brazil
...I doubt I'd have a good life
Hauting my grave, since I would have died at age 8 from cancer lmao
My family was a noble one at the time, so I would probably be in some arranged marriage with some guy from some other noble family, opening my legs for him trying to give him a son stuck in a society that had way to many rules in everyday life
Either the same thing I'm doing today, studying law to become a lawyer or be in the navy or working has lawyer but doing poetry on free time (like many poets did back then, getting a job to be able to live and doing poetry)
Probably alive until my late 60 i guess, since my only allergy is to penicillin, and if i was working has a lawyer i would have a safe job that would increase my chances of surviving
I would've been a soldier and fight for the best president my country ever had António de Oliveira Salazar
I was diagnosed when I was 22, so I would have probably have 2 or 3 kids before I died as well
Also, I would have likely been a farmer too or a fisherman's wife
In England
If you didn't die during the voyage
Fernando VII
I've edited the question, if you had been born 200 years before your actual birth, what would you be doing in 1819
1819, dude
Salazar was born in 1889
And the poor, the sick, the women, the injured, POC
basically 90% of the population
salazar was president in 1932 if i was born in 1819 that would make me 113 years old the oldest person in the world to ever exist was 116 years old so that means i would see salazar become president(best moment in the Portugal history)  and i would still be able to fight for him for 3 years and deffend him from the capitalism's idiots
what a great life i would had
Both my grandmothers were married at the age of 18 and 19
We're from rural Northern Portugal, very, very Catholic (which I also am, but it's not a problem to my family that I remain unmarried nowadays), getting married at an earlier age was the only way you got out of your parents house and gained some semblance of independence
Absolutely
There is one democratic government of China and it resides in the Island of Taiwan
We've seen how the communist regime treats democracy or disent on countless ocasions but unfortunately our governments always follow real politik and chose to side with the opressive regime of the continent in exchange for cheap consumer products
You are not a legitimate government because you win a war
You are the legitimate government  when the people is heard and chooses who will rule
Probably and most likely
Democracy works that way but at least people would have a voice
There's two versions
One says he lives in Lapland, Finland and the other says he lives in the North Pole
Santa's from Lapland
That's what I've always heard
Lapland is often dubbed as "terra do pai natal" (santa claus' Land), when talking to children
The usual saying is that he lives somewhere in the North Pole
When I was a kid my mom also used to say he lived in Lapland,Finland
Here too
At least according to my mom
Santa lives in Lapónia (don't know what's the actual name of the that region in Finland)
Edit: I'm dumb, it's Lappland
When I was young, the one that brought all the presents to the children was Baby Jesus, Menino Jesus
My grandmother used to say which presents came from her baby Jesus, to signal the presents that came from her
It sounds very Santa Clausy in Finish
Not sure if it counts but a tourist/client once asked me how to get to the other side of the island
In mainland Portugal
In the Azores, more specifically in the Oriental Group, some people think that you can just walk from one island to the other when the tide is low
It also pisses me off when anyone comes to Portugal thinking that we belong to Spain or speak spanish (we don't)
I saw a vlogger saying it's tradition to drink a ginginha (cherry liquor), in the morning cause it's medicine
No one drinks in the morning
People often stare at foreigners drinking early in the day and go like "look at those weirdos, drinking so early
Note: ginginha is "medicine" for throat ache, cause it's sweet and (should) have honey
This sounds like something I would do
Asian tourists are generally clueless
Context:
- once again we do not fucking speak Spanish, not even as a second language, it's not like some former Soviet republics where people speak Russian as a second language
- younger people is Portugal, specially in urban centres tend to be well educated, and a large majority of university students in Lisbon speaks, if not perfect, reasonable English
One time I was working as a tourist helper person (if that's even the name), in Rossio, in the centre of Lisbon
I was with this girl, let's call her Raquel
Well, two Americans came to us, full of bags and shit, it looked like they had just landed
Came right to us being all like _¡Hola
_ and _¿Cómo estás?_ with a very heavy American accent
Then they just stoped in front of us, started talking to each other in English saying like 'take out the dictionary', and the guy said something in the lines of 'do you really think they speak any English here
This is the only city they got
They don't even got trains here' Bear in mind that we got plenty of other cities, Rossio is the place of one large ass train station and both of us were wearing shirts that said 'I SPEAK ENGLISH' on the back (in capital letters) and had cards pinned to the chest saying 'I speak' and then a (in my case) Union Jack and both a Portuguese and french flags
Well, this people looked at us, looked at the dictionary and at us, again, and started trying to speak some sort of Anglo-spanish thing
Raquel was becoming really red and angry
She looked at them and went like 'If I were in New York, would like me to go to you and ask you stuff in Spanish saying to your face your not smart enough to speak English
', a little 'uncalled' for, I know, but we were both fed up with those pricks
They just walked out all mad like 'they're dumb and rude blablablablabla'.
I only had to read that it was a video to know which one it was
...does it have a backdoor
Desenrascar
It means to sort something out; to achieve something given the resources or what you have at hand
Like [this
It’s a really useful word
Portugal **caralho**!
"Portugal damn it" is too soft
Sobremesa is postre in Portuguese
After tomorrow is similar
I was hoping to find the classic “[saudade] a unique word from Portuguese speaking countries and Galicia
As explained by A. F. G. Bell in 1912: “The famous saudade of the Portuguese is a vague and constant desire for something that does not and probably cannot exist, for something other than the present, a turning towards the past or towards the future; not an active discontent or poignant sadness but an indolent dreaming wistfulness
But I love love love the art of “desenrascanço”. Also- such a great word to say
Can’t think of an example
What’s the first that comes to your mind
A favourite expression
Also my mood 24/7
Extremely widespread
[This type of building (if you can say that) that you can encounter in Seixal]
If 16th century european architects would travel in time to see those buildings, they would have an hart attack
This one hurts the eyes
Ahahahah isto nem pode contar
No fundo todos sabemos que isto nem acabou de ser construído, mas compreendo porque isto está aqui
Vivem pessoas aí?
When's construction done
I know, it was a joke
Yes, as an optional class
Usually Catholic, but other religions can be taught if there are enough students wanting to do it
I'm Portuguese
The class is available if you want your kid to take it
It's called Moral and Religious Education
It is supposed to teach about your particular religion
I don't think so
Religion is not something to be imposed on children
Their families influence is already bad enough influence on kids
Let them be free to choose whatever they wish to believe in
Moral, aka viagens ao aquashow e n fzr um crlh
é a maneira de convencerem os alunos a não anularem a disciplina para terem mais tardes livres
It depends on what you mean by "religious literacy". If that means smth like teaching kids what Sunni and Shia Islam is, for example, I'd be all in
The problem is that teaching that without getting into preaching is very hard and I don't trust teachers to do that
I don't want my kids to get indoctrinated at school just bcs a good intended Jewish, Muslim, Christian, etc
teacher wanted to show them "the word of God", just no
That's not neither the teacher's nor the school's job
School's supposed to educate and since this is a secular state, we should teach secularism
That doesn't mean teaching atheism, btw, it means secularism

Tell him we are so anti-guns that he might get detained at the airport just for being Texan
In almost a millennium of history, we had many capitals, including Rio de Janeiro
But the two options are:
Guimarães: that's where Portugal was born
Coimbra: It's been there since the Romans
It's the home of one of the oldest universities in Europe
It's basically Portugal's Oxford
I think both these cities have been capitals at one point or another
Edit: I think Lisbon is just fine
I'm very happy that my capital is the second oldest city in Europe (after Athens) and it's even mentioned in pre-roman times in greek texts
Besides, its history speaks volumes about what Portugal is really about
Porto, because the name of the country literally comes from that city (as it was the capital of the County of Portucale)
Lisbon is not even one of my top 10 favorite portuguese citys, but I don't see any other possible capital for our country, mostly Lisbon is the best option because of its size and Central location
Porto
It's realistically the only other city that has capital-level infrastructure, but Lisbon has a better position (more central) for a capital (more central)
Also, in my completely biased opinion it is the most beautiful city in Continental Portugal (Açores and Madeira are also really beautiful)
However, with how hot the Porto vs Lisbon rivalry is already, the country would burn
By the same logic, let me try
Madrid: oh, no
Rome: fuck, even worse
Well, we do have the oldest alliance in the world with the British
So London
Goddamn it
Doesn't work for us ahaha
Genève all the way baby
Yeah, Lisbon
Makes more sense as a capital for many reasons
Coimbra wound't be a bad option because is central and is an old historic city with a cultural and historical significance
Porto is a great city but is too northern to be a capital and Guimarães doesn't make sense  is also too northern and Braga bigger and older city in the region and is a more important city overall the only thing Guimarães has over Braga is that was the first capital
We provide warm and sunny weather and lovely beaches for our fellow northern neighbors to visit, relax and boost our economy lel
Edit: I remembered we provide cheap, quality labor in all areas but mostly tech
We also provide nice shoes, wine and tea produced in the Azores
We were the ones that exported the Roman Empire true to oceans to the world (Europe in other words)
We had a colossal impact in terms of riches that Europe collected, we had and still have one of the largest gold reserves in the world
We also have a huge ocean territory with an important geopolitical location
Right now we provide cheap tourism lol
Poland have an important geographical location, it’s cheaper in terms of transportation, any European country can get there and move to some place else with the goods
so, you mean, meaningless :(
Thank you for your gratefulness, kind baguette warrior
We appreciate your cheese
>Also, leather
Everyone I know who works in leather says you guys are the
Huh
Have you searched how much of European funds come to build those highways
Please do
Have you searched how much European funds come to improve the Polish industries
Please do
And the iron tower
Apart from sometimes having to wait for some procedures, I can't see any downside
In my opinion, if we didn't have the Universal health care many of us probably couldn't have even basic procedures done
I'd like that the waiting time didn't exist but, not having an universal health care system would be much worse
Not really
Perhaps the ironic thing is that you also get properly priced private healthcare
Well, taxes
But you either pay public healthcare for all or private for you, so it's the same
People abusing the system
Like hypochondriacs
LOL
Many of what you said is simply not true
Please do some more research before making such claims
Same here
It's called a "moderator fee", where you pay a symbolyc 20€ per day you spend at the emergency that only gets charged if it's not an emergency (i.e. it's a critical issue and/or you need to stay more than 10 days until they find out what's wrong with you)
It's essentially a hypochondriac tax
Here there's definitely both situations happening
how words in Italian change genders going from singular to plural
Spellings in French and English
Quatre-vingt
I mean, there's a few non-indo-european languages spoken in Europe, but their native speakers probably think most other European languages are nonsensical as well
That's weird
I always thought we either sounded like mid-atlantic Oxford wannabees or like mid-atlantic Mobsters wanabees
I mean Russian is obviously a dialect of Portuguese, but it doesn't carry to our English
Even more fascinating is that almost every portuguese can understand Spanish quite well but Spanish people don't understand a word of portuguese
And the vocabulary is almost the same
A friend of mine went to Sevilla with his friends and he was talking portuguese, then a Spanish guy asks them "where are you from
I Guess from your accent that you're from russia". And this happens just 100 kms away from Portugal
> *(plus)nineteen*
Ten(plus)nine
Have you heard Portuguese
If so tell if at first you thought it sounded like Russian or not because someone people say that Portuguese sounds like Russian (even though the languages have nothing in common, although Portuguese has a few fonectic sounds unique in Europe)
I'm quite interesting in knowing if you guys think it sounds similar
Honestly your comment and the one before are the truest things in the world
When I go abroad and talk portuguese with people back home, I’ve had people hear me and ask if it was russian
I am Portuguese and can confirm most Portuguese people do not speak like that
I'm pretty sure the guy who is speaking is just not comfortable with the language
>And as for Portugese - I love the language, it's so, so beautiful
*Happy Portuguese noises
Thanks for the complement, now i feel bad for not knowing Croatian to compliment back xP but i will listen and then give an opinion
Edit: i have listened a bit of Croatian now, i like how it sounds, it strange but beautiful, i like the sound of it, the sounds are strange but they mix well idk really well how to explain but sounds really good it's beautiful
We stress the vouls a lot, i assume Russian does that too, so that might explain the similarities in the phonetics is my guess
Let me have some of that cool w**h**ip
Is that good
I have several questions and I don't really know where to start with
How
Why
Are you sure you mean sex and not sexy
How did you come up with that idea
What's your opinion on Portuguese, be brutally honest, does it sound good or bad middle of the road
Oooooooh XP that's interesting
Thanks xP
Not a really interesting one but still: the Euro crisis, I wanna learn more about the reason why I needed to wait 10 years to buy a Wii because I couldn't buy one in 2009 because everyone was broke
Anything that happened east of Spain more than 150 years ago
The whole Ottomans reaching Vienna thing
Don't remember it ever being mentioned at school
I should introduce you to my mother then
She's obsessed with that time period and has tons of books on it
Yeah, if not for the internet I wouldn't have known about this
Which is a shame
I'm going to go ahead and admit that I'm unsure whether if I even know the basics
Thanks for that, I sure heard of European banks dying, the crisis killed 4 banks here in Portugal
Possibly even more
I read that he took credit for Italys pensions scheme when actually it had been made up by factory workers and "sindacato" buy he basically renamed it and presented it as his
I live in Italy now
And it's sad to see some people defend him
The amount of brainwashing that must have gone on is unreal
Also a lot of older people born post war are called Benito
So this is right about the most portuguese thing one could imagine
In 1998 the second bridge over the Tagus River was finished (Vasco da Gama Bridge) and it was a national event
It was the largest bridge in Europe, finished in the year when Portugal hosted the World Expo, so it was a big year for us, at least publicity-wise
So in order to commemorate the inauguration of the largest bridge in Europe, we achieved another world record: the biggest table in the world
[17
000 people were invited to attend a lunch of Feijoada IN THE BRIDGE] and I bet some people in Portugal don't even know this (I just found out recently)
So yeah, we inaugurated a bridge with a mega lunch in the bridge itself, for 17
000 people
Very portuguese
In the XV century, our king sent a spy to try to gather information along the silkroad on how to get spices in India and to spy on the Muslim kingdom's along the way
He was gone for 40 year's and was assumed dead, until he was found as an old men in Ethiopia by a later Portuguese expedition
He had a high position in court and had his own harem
Along the way he visited Spain, Morocco, Italy, Greece, Egypt, Sudan, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, India, Mozambique, Iran, Eritrea and Ethiopia
His name was Pero da Covilhã and he was a Renaissance James Bond
You should check more about his travels because they are quite fantastic
We threw out of a window the Galizian noble who was the lover of the Queen, in order to establish a bastard master of the Order of Avis as our king
He took the 'be the change you want to see in the world' too literally
I wish I was alive back then so that I could go and eat my well deserved feijoada on top of that huge ass brige ahahah this is gold
Sorry, circumcision ceremony with a submarine
Most republics with a Prime Minister tend to also have a President, albeit with mostly ceremonial powers
You can't sue me
I'm a cardenal now
At least for me, it's the 25th of April which marks the freedom day when the Salazarist dictatorship was overthrown
People listen [Grândola Vila Morena] and some get carnations, the revolution synbol
Pre covid, people used to march along the Avenida da Liberdade
Great day, although fascists don't like it
But fuck them
Now, if I had to choose a day/moment EVERYONE liked and celebrated, it would be the 10th July 2016, when Portugal won the European cup with Eder's goal
What a memorable day
"É FERIADO HOJE CARALHO"
Liberty Day, 25th April, next sunday, but the typical celebration is restricted to just few people and I think it's going to be raining this year :(
As far as I'm concerned, fascists don't count as "some people". 25 of April is obviously the most celebrated day because of all the festivities and events going on
In Portugal we have a large period of celebrations
Traditionally, people would set up their Christmas decorations on the 8th of December (Feast of the Immaculate Conception)
Nowadays, people usually set up their decorations whenever they like (usually 1st of December)
The traditional Christmas decoration is the "Presépio" ("Nativity Scene")
Some people will have a small one, with only the Holy Family, but others will have larges ones, with various figures such as villages, shepherds, the three wise kings and folk characters
Kids will usually include some of their own (when I was younger I would put a Wall-e toy and a Mega-Man toy I had on our Presépio)
Some regions have their own presépios (in my region, Algarve, the traditional presépio is not a Nativity Scene, but an image of a young Jesus, not baby, with various fruits and plants decorating)
Christmas trees are also a very common element
However, this tradition is more recent (it begun in the 70s I believe)
Another Christmas decoration (now falling out of use) is a seara
It is planting a small vase with wheat so that when Christmas comes, the wheat is all grown up
On the last day of school, most schools organize a Christmas party, where students sing for their parents or act in Christmas plays
Some days before Christmas there's the legendary "Natal dos Hospitais" (Hospitals' Christmas)
It is a TV broadcast from various hospitals throughout the country
Famous portuguese singers, presenters, comedians and other figures go to the hospitals to celebrate Christmas with those who can't be at home because of work or heath issues, and that's broadcasted nationwide
It's usually directed towards children, but everyone loves it, as it is a really heartwarming moment
The traditional Christmas meal ("Consoada") is eaten during the evening of Christmas Eve (usually a dinner)
Codfish (the famous Bacalhau) is the traditional dish, but other dishes can also be eaten (tuna, lamb, turkey are examples)
In my region (Algarve) the traditional dish is octopus
The main dish is usually accompanied by other foods such as shellfish, wild meats, snacks, etc
At the end, various deserts are served, the most famous of these is the Bolo Rei ("King Cake")
On the cake there will be a small token or figure and a bean hidden
When eating the cake, if you come across the token in your slice, you get to keep it
But if you find the bean, you have to buy next year's cake
After the meal, traditionally, people would go to the Missa do Galo ("Mass of the Rooster"), a special catholic mass that begins exactly at midnight
At the end of this mass, everyone kisses an image of Baby Jesus (I hope they don't do this one this year xD), which is then placed at the Presépio (Nativity Scene) of every church
After this, people go home, put their image of Baby Jesus in their presépios and open their presents
This obviously is a very traditional and religious thing, and nowadays people don't attend this mass as they used to, preferring to stay at home socializing with family and watching movies or Christmas programmes on the TV
Some families open their presents on the morning of the 25th
Traditionally, Baby Jesus brings the gifts
Nowadays, Father Christmas (our version of Santa Claus) brings it
Most people will leave a treat on the table for Father Christmas (like milk and cookies)
In some regions, it's traditional to leave other things, like wine
In the Algarve, the tradition is to leave a shoe
On Christmas day, it's traditional to have another big meal, this time lunch
Each region also their own traditional things
The most famous is the one in Penamacor, where people steal trees and burn them in the church yard
In my region, people usually go for a dive on the beach on the morning of the 25th
On the first weeks of January, it's traditional to sing the Janeiras
A group of people go home to home singing songs
They are then given food and treats
If they like the treats they sing song praising whoever gave them
If they don't, they sing songs joking about them
Someplaces will have the people singing in a single spot, and everyone can come and watch them
On the 6th of January we celebrate the Epiphany
Portuguese too
If I saw an old lady with a stache then yeah, I guess, but since we ain't an ethno state and kinda of are literal brothers with Spain, not really
[men] [women] Although the dead give-away would be a short-person, brown-green eyes and a tan
[Here are the tipical phenotype of the Portuguese people,scroll down to see]
I honestly think French people are the hardest to pinpoint
They just look "European".
I think Nordic people have a very distinctive brow
The eyes and eyebrows are a give away, if you're not sure about the blonde hair
I showed this to my girlfriend and asked what she thought
She instantly said Greek
I asked why
She said the tan, the moustache and the navy vibe gave it away
I don't think Cristina Ferreira gives the right look of a Portuguese woman but Rui Unas is spot on (with or without the stache)
I can spot "come-ons" from a mile away, ahaha
(come-ons, "cámones", it's the name we give to British tourists)
I don't know much about makeup, but if you had a bunch of white girls wearing heavy makeup all in a row I could probably point out which one is British
There's like a specific style of slapper specific to Britain
I beg to disagree
Typical Lisbon mom type
Based on some statistics, I hypothesize what you've been noticing is depression
The most visited city is Lisbon, the most visited region is Algarve and the Portuguese tourists tend to go more to the "North region". There is the sanctuary of Fátima that attracts a lot of people
I'd say Lisbon, Porto and the Algarve region (specifically the coast)
Lisbon and Porto seemed to have become really popular in recent years
I lived in Lisbon for a year some years ago and it had a lot of visitors but not a crazy amount, yet every time I go there to see my friends I notice more and more tourists
The whole Baixa area is so busy nowadays (well apart from this year that is), and you can even find tourists in other parts of the city where you wouldn't expect them
Lisbon and Porto tend to attract the more cultured tourists (for lack of a better word) whereas the Algarve tends to attract people who want sun and sand
People, both national and international, primarily go there for the beaches
While not as bad as some parts of Spain and Greece, you still get a lot of trashy tourists particularly in places like Albufeira
The barrocal and mountainous parts of the region go virtually ignored
The Algarve focuses a lot on tourism and so this year it's been hit very hard
As for Scotland, after having lived in Edinburgh for a year I can tell you the city centre is packed with tourists
It's even busier during the Fringe festival in August
Also I found the Isle of Skye to be pretty packed as well
The Algarve, our southern coast, is pretty much British territory
Or at least it was before covid, rip
Lisbon and Algarve, for sure
But due to Corona Virus a lot of portuguese are spending their holidays in the interior which is also gorgeous ️
In Portugal it's the two big cities, Lisboa and Porto and the summer "paradise" is in Algarve, in the south of the country
Particularly Albufeira and Vilamoura
In Portugal basically have various spots, usually people start with Porto, Lisbon or Algarve
In an order, for example if people start from the North, go to Porto, then visit wine cellars there, Lello Library, D. Luís Bridge, Sé and walk around or go to a sightseeing bus
Then, some go to Guimarães or Braga, if not, some go to Aveiro, Coimbra and/or Fátima
Then Lisbon and Sintra
Algarve people go to stay there at an apartment and stay there to go to the beach and stuff
And then, in the end go to the archipelagos of Madeira and Azores
Lisbon and Porto for the "normal tourist" and Algarve for the drunk british ones
Probably not the most touristy area, but in the Azores you can see tourists everywhere, no matter the season
I live in Lisbon and I can assure the amount of tourists during the summer was crazy, everything full from restaurants to the museums
it’s not always “cultured tourists” since a part of them were young people sleeping on hostels and pensions = spending less money therefore not providing much to the economy
Yeah "cultured" isn't the best word and I was struggling to find a way to describe them as they're not exactly the same as your typical Algarve tourist
I know some names
Many times can't relate cities to states, unless they are the really famous ones like Chicago, Illinois or Los Angeles, California
I don't really know to be honest
I believe I know them all, but then I like knowing stuff about a lot of countries
If I were to mention a state to somebody else over here then I'd probably add an ", America" just so that they know what I'm talking about, the exceptions being states like California, Texas, Florida, and New York which I think are generally known
I can name and put on the map almost all of them
But europeans in general aren't able to name or locate most of them (the same way americans can't do it with most European countries)
And Shawn Michaels from WWE I think
I found both French and German to be harder than English
Latin was also hard
Proudly european
Considering all the economical suport, yes
However, sometimes it looks like we are better of without then
I cried a bit reading this
Top of my head cant remember, but at least anti-vaxx i know they have 0 popularity
Everyone believes vaccines work and we good
You're forgetting the famous case on TVI's kids show "Batatinha e Companhia
" On how TVI is hiding all the information on what happened
>So he got drunk and took his butcher knife (he was a butcher) und chopped of his own right thumb so
He couldn’t use guns anymore and therefore he didn’t get drafted
That's a way to escape drafting
But hell, I couldn't chop my own thumb off even if it meant my life lol
It's a mixed bag
Aside from most of it being written in Brazilian Portuguese, some articles could definitely use a bit of work
Not only are they lacking information in comparison to English Wikipedia, some of the writing is very unprofessional
Proper Brazilian Portuguese is fine because it's very much understandable aside from some differences it has with European Portuguese, but as soon as it starts becoming less formal it becomes harder to read
Also, many articles feel like they have to shoehorn a section into how the topic in question relates to Brazil (and sometimes Portugal and other lusophone countries)
I generally stick to English Wikipedia as it's much more comprehensive, professional, and easier to understand
It also contains a lot more sources
I only really use Portuguese Wikipedia when I'm looking for information that's more relevant to lusophone countries
Too much Brazilian portuguese for my taste, except for articles that specifically talk about Portugal and portuguese things inly portuguese people would know about
So I just use the English language version instead
I find Wikipedia very useful to translate some subjects for example animals, plants, thecnical stuff
So I usually navigate between English, Portuguese and Spanish
Definitely wiki in Portuguese it's only good to see the résumé and if I want a more detailed version i go to the English version
There's normally some mistakes that a associate to the fact that it's written by Brazilians
The Spanish version usually its very good although in some more obscure subjects not so complete as the English version
Well, because of Brazil I search very easily wikipedia ij Portuguese
But the PT-BR has a noticeble different grammar and words, it aproaches 18th century PT-PT and has some Spanish and Italian features, so in Portugal you must be very careful if you using an wikipedia article for school
I only use it for my native language to search for things related to my country it's more complete and historical accurate (besides sometimes completely butchering it) for the rest English
It's awful, I only use it for articles about Portugal, usually other articles are too jarring to be comfortably read IMO
The Portuguese one is mostly good (tho  ironically most is in brazilian portuguese and not european one,.
When it comes to important subjects it is usually very complete and informative
However when it comes to less important subjects it can be way to brief and incomplete or just not that well written or even outdated
Since i can understand English fairly well i usually just use the English version as it is often more complete unless i want to know about something related to Portugal in specific or if the English article features to many technical words i'm not used to
Same thing, there's just way more content in the english pages
They’re not mistakes, it’s just written in Brazilian Portuguese, which has a slightly different grammar and vocabulary
I use the English one almost exclusively because of the Brazilian grammar
Nothing against Brazilians, but it looks weird and it's a confusing read at times
> it aproaches 18th century PT-PT
That is a myth, or rather, a misinterpretation
If you look to old portuguese texts you will notice that the grammar is more similar to modern day european portuguese, like the use of the second person and the use of verb-pronoun (like "vi-te" instead of "te vi")
The only exception would be the more prominent use of the gerund ("vendo") which is more commonly used in Brazil (although still used in some Portuguese regions)
In the 18th century, most educated and high class Brazilians would use the same grammar that we use nowadays
There is also the fact that Brazilian Portuguese has a lot more loan words, especially from English, african and native languages which did not influence that much European Portuguese
What is theorized is that the Brazilian accent MIGHT have been similar to old Portuguese, not the grammar, but even that is disputed
It is also important to add that the Brazilian accent varies greatly from region to region and throughout history
For example, here is a video of someone speaking in 19th century Brazilian Portuguese:
Notice the hard R's. It matches to Eça de Queirós' description of the Brazilian accent of the time
Also notice that the grammar is far more similar to European Portuguese than modern day Brazilian Portuguese
It is depending where you live
I can't drink the tap water at my home, but at my friend's (who lives in the next town over) house I can
In Edinburgh I used to drink tap water all the time, in fact I found it tasted a lot better than bottled water over there
It's normal but it's also normal to drink bottled water
Some people really don't like tap water though
And at restaurants you pretty much always get bottled water unless you specifically ask for tap water, which most people don't.
And yeah, tap water is chlorinated here so it does taste a bit chemical
Though I guess I'm sensitive to that because I grew up drinking bottled water at home
I tend to drink tap water nowadays though
But for instance Swedish tap water is incredible, and it tastes more like our bottled water
And on the other hand I find some foreign bottled waters (e.g. Evian) quite bad tasting and more reminiscent of our tap water (but worse)
I think they've got more minerals than our bottled waters
So this varies a bit by country
Yes, I only drink bottled water when I'm outside without my personal bottle with tap water
excluding that one time when my home town was hit by *legionella* and no one could drink or use pipe water
very sad times
In Portugal, tap water quality depends a bit on where you are
In and around Lisbon, tap water is pretty good
But in the South, tap water has kind of a weird flavour to it, and most people buy 4L bottles of water for drinking and cooking
I'm not sure about the North or in the Azores and Madeira, but I'm guessing it might be different
Here in Portugal, sparkling water always comes in green bottles
I found out this wasn't the case everywhere the hard way
Let me guess, mismanagement of EU funds
Covid Will change that
Not in a good day, but the airbnbs will be empty and prices will go down
I feel like this is a problem in so many places throughout Europe
I wonder if there could ever be a ban on stag and hen parties (the problematic kind that is) in the continent considering the problems they cause
I believe some Spanish islands are trying to deal with drunk idiots by issuing curfews and other measures, and it would be great for that to be implemented all around Europe
I mean I like partying and getting drunk but not if it causes problems for other people around me
We have the same problem here in Lisbon
Is between Madrid and Barcelona a valley in a mountainous area
Those who live there say they enjoy the best of both worlds and a peaceful place in an hour is in Madrid or Barcelona
Main steps:
1) pick up all the latin vocabulary you know (mostly words in Spanish)
2) substitute "gracias" by "obrigado" and use it as much as you can, portuguese people appreciate that
3) forget the days of the week you have learned in other latin languages - except for saturday and sunday - and substitute them for ordinal numbers (ex: monday - the second - segunda, tuesday - the third - terça, etc
4) Grammatical connectors are verbal
When you are speaking, instead of using a comma and a point in the end of the sentence, you use "caralho" as a comma and "foda-se" as a point
You can also use "puta que pariu" when you want to add some expressivity to the phrase
5) A large part of the nouns ending in "-ion" in spanish, end in "-ão" in portuguese -if you have trouble saying this just imagine you'd like to scare someone
(Ex: communication - comunicacion - comunicação)
6) Pick all the Spanish vocabulary you know, add some italian accent and in the top use closed vowels like the russians do
Now your accent is good enough
Now you're able to learn portuguese
Edit: step 4) is pretty much applied in the north of the country, not so in the south
In Portuguese, city is also feminine
"A cidade"
Para usar esses conectores deves ser do norte
Step 4 is very important
Easier
First, be Russian, second, get drunk and finally try to speak Spanish
Done
For 5), I think it helps to pronounce the -ão like the "oun" in the middle of the word "sound
" Pronounce the word, but take the 's' and the 'd' sounds out, and you got it
Como é evidente
Devia ter especificado que isso usa-se mais no norte
Better
I saw this on [YouTube] and was pretty funny
Just imagine you are a Spanish guy flerting with a russian girl, you spent the night together and 9 months later you have a baby
That's how you do portuguese accent
That's right, not even romanian is that different from other latin languages
We just use latin derived terms for saturday (sábado) and sunday (domingo)
Mas muito boa explicaçãoahahah
Yeah it's really closed
What about the rest
The message above and so
Is it too hard
Also, the suffix "-zione" in italian turns to "-ção" in portuguese
I have been in Erasmus in Italy and was very easy for me to understand
After 3 or 4 months without having italian classes I could speak normally with an italian
My Spanish friends also chose to have their classes in italian rather than in English, because it's much easier for them
That's nice, to know our languages are more closer than i thought
Why a large european state cannot be built
USA: 300 million people, one official language (of course I know there are a lot of spanish speakers, but English is the only official language)
Europe:
Belgium - 11 million people, 3 languages
Switzerland - 8 million people, 4 languages
All the other countries have their own language, some of them their own currency, some have monarchies, some have republics
It is impossible to bring this together into one single state
In Portugal too, because we are at the Western tip, we sometimes feel excluded from the rest of Europe, as most of the action happens in Central Europe
I'm guessing Russia also had/has this feeling
Ok, bringing Belgium and Switzerland to the topic was a way to prove our cultural diversity comparing to the USA
Actually, things work there and I hope it continues like that
But now imagine bringing together about 50 languages and eliminate currencies like the Sterling pound or the swiss franc
Also the EU integrates 27 of 50 countries, there is no territorial coesion
Do you still it would work
And would you include just the EU state members or all the countries in Europe
I'm not being pessimistic, I'm just fine with the way things work right now
We have the same currency, free movement between our countries, cooperative policies, why complicate
Come on dude give us a break
we spent a lot of time fighting off spanish and french kingdoms just for the sake of our existence in the span of like seven hundred years
Plus the CEP (Corpo Expedicionário Português) was a thing in WWI
A militarized force of 10000 men, that was totally obliterated by superior German strategy and firepower in 1916 in Belgium if I’m not mistaken
We did sat out in WWII but hey I guess Salazar sympathized with the likes of his kind back then
We participate in WWI
I didn't happen on our soil (outside of African territories), but we didn't sat them out
Portugal fought in WW1
Of course cooperation is better than just blocking each other
My point is that is impossible to create a "United States of Europe" because countries want to remain independent in some issues and there is a lot of nationalist feeling through the different countries
Don't get me wrong, I completely believe and support the EU project and the Euro currency, but I think a full integration now would be a step backwards
Seems a plausible point
I think a common army would be interesting
A stronger parliament is difficult while people there are speaking different languages
But I agree with you on that point, Europe should have more power in international decisions
That is quite allright dear ol chap, no worries
Let’s put some shrimp on the barbie and just forget about it
No worries
Doable
If we say we're thirsty they say drink a wall
If we say we're cold they say go to your uncles bed
If we say we're hungry they say eat a man
I think it makes more sense in portuguese because it all rhymes
Nah still weird
If you pick your nose: "Is there going to be a party
You're cleaning the ballroom
If you cry excessively after a small injury: "Careful, your bowels are going to come out of there
If you sulk: "Little goat pouted, went to the hill and never came back
" in song
If the house is chaotic/ a mess: "What is this
Mother Joana's house
If you run inside the house and fall: "Well done
" (Bem feito
É bem feito
If you're good and do all your chores and homework: "You did nothing more than your obligation
When you ask what the dinner is, and they don't really know, every mother says it's "asker's tongues"    pt=linguas de perguntador
We say: Do you have a big ass
Here we say: "This looks like a pigsty
" or "It looks like the dog's house
You leave the door open: "are you from Braga
In Portugal or Germany
In Portugal it's "are you from Braga"
In Portugal
I never heard "are you form Braga" in my life
Maybe is a regional difference
Were in Portugal are you from
North
I'm from the north west coast side, and you are
Im from south Portugal so maybe is that
Braga is not a city we realy think about down here
Gaia, caralho
As far as i know it is illegal to pee in the ocean in portugal
It's a code violation to call a bathroom a bathroom without a bidet
Bidet-less service bathrooms are okay, but you must have a full-one to sell a house (I believe this is also true in Spain and Italy, the only other two civilised countries)
Mas há alguém que cumpre
Faço isso mil vezes e ainda não fui preso ou darem me uma multa
Do you call the virus coronita as well or has the entire country gone criminal
I think we can 80% of the time, not to say more because i'm not sure
Btw, as a portuguese, that thing you said about your languages written form being based on portuguese is interesting
Could you explain more what you mean or why do you think that
Not all the time, there are some homophone sounds
The big one is à/há which everybody confuses every once in a while when writing fast
H at the beginning of a word is silent in portuguese but há is a verb and à is a preposition+article
Otherwise we might confuse ge/gi with je/ji because G has the sound of a J before e and i.
We might also confuse ç or c before some vowels with s (ss) or -s- between vowels with -z-
The letter -x- is a mess
Most words have an univocal spelling though there are some sources of confusion
I'm portuguese and yes most words are pretty easy to write after hearing them, I never really thought that that must be difficult for other languages
In Portuguese
Probably
In English
50/50
The way we pronounce the letter "o" at the of words isn't the same "o" we pronounce in the alphabet
Wow i didn't know about that, i was searching for it now and its very interesting
These diacritcs seem to be like the chinese tones or am i wrong
I also noticed you seem not to have all the consoants we have like the F (although i didn't notice if you had some we didn't)
That's true but you can still spell them easily
As a native speaker, it's intuitive
I forgot to mention, but the letter "s" also has different sounds, depending on where it is located in a word
I have some explanations/conjectures for those:
* Nh in Portuguese since forever as well
Ñ is dirty
* Y, K and W are only used in recently-imported foreign words, so you wouldn't have them in the 16th or 17th century
* Gi might be related to the way some Chinese languages use the Zh (it would sound like our Gi, I guess, since our Z is like in English
* Ph was used until 1910 in a lot of Latin-origined words, but F was also present in latin, so we always had both
I think he might just have picked one
It's even closer, spanish use ñ and we use nh
We also have ch like she english sh, and lh like
idk
The c and the s can also be confused like in sinto and cinto
Well, H is silent unless in a digaph (ch, nh, lh)
Maybe he added the h after the g so you don't read it like "**ge**t" instead "**je**t". In Portuguese we need a mute U between a G and an E/I to get the hard G instead of the soft one, but maybe he didn't want you guys to mistakenly read the U, but I'm just trying to guess, now
So it's more like tch
And now all of a sudden i got interested in a language i had never paid much attention to
Damn, vietnamese around that i know are like
And not like Portugal is your dream destination when you want to work abroad
"Sending a fax" in Portuguese
\[PORTUGAL\] Just the word "João" it's a name, but for some reason no foreigner can pronounce it right
Esternocleidomastoideu in Portugal is kind of a meme because of an old movie
ñ is "nh" here
I've always found that "uit" just sounds like "out" in an Irish accent
In Portuguese we say
Mano out Puto (I think it goes the same as Bro for English)
Portuguese:
For a group of people - Boas Pessoal (Boh
ush P'soo
ahl) which means good morning/afternoon/night people
Boas can be said at any time of the day
For a single person - Boas mano (Boh
ush Mah
noo) which means good (whatever time it is) brother
These are just the ones that I use
But there are many other ways of saying it
Wow we have also picha in Portuguese
Never knew
Ayyy tío
Yeah I'd say those are the most common (Mano being "Bro" and Puto being the masculine of "Kid")
In the Algarve we say Moço/Moçe (which means "Boy"), though it depends on where you live and your social group
It's also used for emphasis or as an exclamation
Where I studied in the Alentejo some guys would say Primo ("Cousin") which I love
And I think they say, or used to say, Chavalo in Lisbon
The worst term imo is Tropa ("Army" or "Troop"), because people use it as a singular word despite it being a plural one
Mostly used by people who try to be thugs
I also hear "filho" sometimes
"Compicha" is very funny because it means "my friend who also has a dick".
I'm from Lisbon and never heard someone saying Chavalo but that's hilarious and yea the Tropa term is normally for the ones that think they are the best and lets be honest 99% sure they consume drugs
Ei: rabeta, paneleiro, meu, filho, moço, cabrão, jovem, menino
depende do gajo e do nível de afinidade
I can't take people who say Tropa seriously
They just sound so tryhard
Stick to Mano or Puto
No meu grupo de amigos cá da terra também dizemos "Zé" e "Cara de cu".
Zé aqui é só para quem de chama José, nunca dizemos fora disso
So, I am from the south of Portugal (Algarve), and we have lots of almond trees
Legend goes that a moorish king married a blond northern princess, from a country with lots of snow in the winter (so, clearly not from around here)
They loved each other very much, but she was increasingly sad, year after year
He finally asked her what was wrong, and she said that she missed the snow from her home country
So, he had thousands and thousand of almond trees planted
They blossom in winter, and the flowers are white
So one day, she came to her palace window, and saw all the fields filled "with snow".
It's a lovely love story
Not a legend but a true story, embellished by some myths added a few years later:
The story of Peter the first and Inês de Castro
The whole story is quite long but as a TLDR let's just say that it involves a perceived loss of power by the crown of Portugal because of a romance between the heir and a Galician dame that ended up with her being killed on the orders of the King,  her killers slain in the goriest way and the corpse of the Peter's mistress exhumed,  sat on the throne and crowned as Queen of Portugal
Full story:
I have one
I don't rly know if it could be considered a legend or not, or if it even rly did happen, but it's usually a way to make fun of the British
Ok, so the story goes like this:
In the 18th, 19th century, the British, ever so imperialistic and looking for land, wanted to own part of the Azores islands (I'm trusting you know where those are)
The Azores are a volcanic archipelago and, since they're so close to the mid-oceanic rift, it's common for new land to appear out of the sea, usually made out of _pedra-pomes_ (pumice)
As you may know, pumice flouts, from its lack of density and, since the heavy rock and minerals inside those newly formed rocks were still very hot, still being magma, a small "island" would surface
That would be for some hours/days, until the magma inside would solidify and the island would go back to the ocean's bottom
Well, there was a British ship, which was tasked with either purchasing some land from the islanders, to build a military facility there, something they never accomplished to, or discovering some new land, for the empire
One day, there was an underwater eruption and there came a little new pumice island
The islanders, having been living there for generations, knew not to go there
There was no reason to, after all: nothing lived there, the soil was barren and hot and there was nothing for either the cows to eat (there are lots of cows in the Azores, it's like sheep in Wales) nor place for plants to grow, thus, no one really cared about the small new island
No one but the British crew, who immediately after hearing about the new land, sailed to claim it for the great British Empire, the empire where the sun never sets
Well, mission accomplished, they thought
They had discovered a new land, right in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, right for the taking
Now they just had to go back to England and the King would make them heroes, they thought, heroes
And so they did
They left the Azores and sailed back to Britain having only left a Union Jack on the island, reminding everyone of the everlasting power of the British
But, you know, sea travel was quite slow, in those days
It took them almost a year to come back with a bigger expedition to start a colony
They took so long indeed that the island had gone back to where it came from, to the bottom of the ocean
With it, the proud British flag
It's said that the flag is still there, at the bottom, and that the British are so powerful (or, at least, were) that they own the seabed
They just can't get to it
The message here is, obviously to teach children not to be greedy
I don't have anything against British people btw, I'm not even from the Azores
Just that you kinda left (and still do, ngl) a bad impression wherever you went :)
Do you also have stories about the "enchanted/bewitched moorish girls"? (don't know how to translate this, to be honest)
Apparently, Algarve is filled with "mouras encantadas", that will give you treasures if you break their curse/enchantment
It's amazing
In the Algarve every town has it's "moura encantada" story
The one from my town (Silves) goes something like this:
During the conquest of Silves, the christians layed a siege to the city
Legend has it that a moorish princess, daughter of the ruler of the city, fell in love with one prince from the attacking side
They frequently exchanged letters
Her father didn't like it, so he forbid it, but they would still secretly exchange letters
One day, he convinced her to open the doors of the city at night so he could enter and kiss her
She agreed
On a night of full moon, she secretly went to the walls and opened the doors
But she didn't find the prince alone
All his army was there
She had just opened the doors for the enemy to enter
She run as fast as she could, hiding herself on the castle's water tank
Extremely sad, she cried herself until she died
Legend has it that if you go to the castle on a night of full moon, you can still hear her cries coming from the water tank, while her ghost patrols the walls, so that no one will ever again invade the city
Apart from the new year's eve, we celebrate the anniversary of the Carnation Revolution with fireworks and party
The Carnation Revolution happened in the 25th of April of 1974, and put an end to the fascist regime
If we have the chance, we'll just light one up for fun
and Saint John's!
There's fireworks from Luís I bridge to the Douro river
The duke of Wellington was leading the troops in Portugal while the king was in Brazil
After beating the french general Massena on the third french invasion, the duke ate the steak that was being made to the french general in case he won
After pretty much everyone told him that going to war in North Africa was a bad idea, King D. Sebastião of Portugal, who had no children, decided to go to war anyway (Battle of Alcácer-Quibir), and be the one to lead the troops
He died
There was no heir
Portugal ended up losing its independence to Spain for 60 years, which heavily accelarated the decline of its already declining Empire
Also involving North Africa, que conquest of the city of Ceuta - which was a huge disappointment
In 1415, it was a very important city where a lot of commercial trades took place, and the Portuguese wanted to gain control of said trades (mostly oriental products like spices and gold)
They sent a huge army and quickly succeeded in seizing the city
However, it was a big flop
The moors just changed the trade routes to other nearby cities, meaning there was no profit being made, whilst simultaneously attacking the city in hopes of taking it back, which meant a lot of expenses in fighting them off
That Salazar (Portuguese dictator) died because he fell off a chair
Was that the one where the builders were using two different methods of measurements and weights
That happened a few years ago with a drone of the portuguese navy
And then we repeated it in Tangier and a few dozen settlements in the coast of modern-day Morocco
he fell of a chair, which debilitated him massively and led him to be taken out of power, but he died two years after the fall
the hilarious things is no one told him he was no longer in charge and for the rest of his life people around him pretended he was still dictator
Sweden is definitely on my bucket list so I will make a note of it
Ship is definitely beautiful
It was the Mars climate orbiter, Lockheed Martin used feet and inches instead of the metric system to measure acceleration
At least you can vote for local and european elections (if you register)
This one is kind of a weird one because this is somewhat unknown even among Portuguese people and the theme is also weird, but here it goes
Unfortunately, during our history as a planet, we've had to deal with slavery
Also unfortunately, slavery has always had a big racial connotation, as in "it's fine for black people to be enslaved because they're not real people, they're inferior, they're animals".
Well, queue in "Padre António Vieira".
This was a Portuguese priest who actively preached that slavery is fine, but black people are just regular people, so they are not to inherently be inferior and enslaved
This man went out of his way to fight racial injustices *only*. He believed that racism was very bad, but slavery was fine, as long as it didn't have to do with race
Black people were just regular people, so they shouldn't inherently be slaves because of the color of their skin
In fact, they should be allowed to own slaves as well, white slaves if they wanted to (since if all races are the same, white slaves would exist as well)
When the BLM movement reemerged this year and statues all over America and the rest of the world started being vandalized and/or destroyed, a statue of him was also vandalized here in Lisbon since he "wasn't against slavery".
I found that to be a very interesting grey area because yes, slavery is bad and he didn't oppose it, but this dude was FOR race equality, he wanted white people to be considered as possible slaves and black people to own slaves too
He had problems with the race thing, not the practice, so technically, vandalizing his statues makes no sense in the context of the protest
He's a very well known figure in Portugal, to the point where his texts are widely studied in school due to the complex Portuguese usage
However, most people don't know about this quirk about him, which I always found to be one of the most interesting things about him
Some tea related trivia
Portugal is one of the few places in Europe where tea is produced, and the only one when it comes to green tea
Said tea is produced in the Azores islands
Tea was introduced to Europe in the 16th by the Portuguese after they made contact with the Japanese
Catherine of Braganza popularised the drinking of tea among the nobility in Britain when she married king Charles II
We have the record for longest table setting in Europe
So on the 22nd of March 1998, to celebrate the newly built Vasco da Gama bridge (which still is the longest bridge in Europe), a team made a 5 Km table on the bridge and served lunch for more than 16,000 people
Around ten tonnes of *Feijoada* (pork and beans, a common Portuguese meal) were served
As far as I know, this used to be the world record but it was beaten by some Indians or Egyptians, can't quite tell based on what Google says
[News article (BBC)]
[About the bridge]
One of our dictators died because he fell of a chair
Let me add most of our contributions to Mathematics and Geography
For example, the Portuguese mathematician [Pedro Nunes] discoveries contributed to establishing plane and ship routes
Also, the [Mercator Projection] was supposedly stolen from the Portuguese court
The Portuguese had an habit of keeping their discoveries a secret, so when they were found, the finder got to keep all the credit
This is in line with the discovery of America before Columbus and so on
There's more stuff
One more example is the knowledge we helped preserve from the golden age of Islam
Also a small coffee production in the island of S. Jorge
Which I believe it is the only place in Europe where coffee is produced
We also were part of the armada unfortunately
People never talk about it
Basically kick-started our demise as the strongest naval empire in Asia and we fought the Dutch for decades and lost most of our foothold in SE Asia
I don't care what temperature it is, it's always a perfect time for ice-cream
I believe tea became more popular among the general populace when India became a British colony, as it was then that tea became more affordable for the average person
Before that it was more of a luxury item
Actually didn't know about that
Some Portuguese are convinced that has we not lost of Asian colonies we would be rich today, ignoring that the reason for the Dutch to be rich lays more with the industrial revolution
Nationalistic morons
True, your revolt also helped our restoration movement as the Spanish couldn't fight on 2 fronts at full strength
Guess just not having a fascist or communist dictatorship in the period of biggest economic expansion in the western world was key
Everyone here thinks that 1
99€=2
00€, so that strategy is just useless
Take my ~~money~~ €1
95 and shut up
I'm here representing Portugal and we wanted out
I was never in the scouts, so I will say what I kbow:
-There are no Boy scouts or Girl Scouts, its mixed
-The Scouts are part of the Catholic church, so you need to go to church and sunday school, and do all that catholic stuf, There is also secular scouts but its a much smaller organization
-They do all the normal scout thing, camping, learning to tie knots, learning to make shelters, pray to our lord Jesus Christ, all that normal stuff
-They have weird clothes
-There are big reunions with all the scouts from Portugal (organized by the Curch)
There is more stuff by I don't remember anything more
Portuguese scout checking in
We have them mixed and separate scouts organisations
CNE - The catholic ones (mixed), AEP - The non catholic ones (mixed) and the AGP - Girl scouts group
As far as I know the AEP are usually more "militarized" then the CNE but it depends of how each group even inside the CNE organisation decides how to do their scouting
We definitely use weird clothes, you may check them [here] and find out more about the CNE, non scouts make fun of our "Jarreteiras" the dingling colored thing that we use on our high socks, I think they look really dorky tbh
Being part of the Catholic association we do learn about our boy Jesus but some groups take it more serious than others
Older leaders are way more religious than the younger ones
As one of the younger leader I don't even believe in that, but I feel like  the spirituality may add some good values and mystique to scouting
There's a problem atm, many of the leaders are like like 35+, as younger scouts leave the movement or simply don't find the time to do it
It takes quite some time and effort to organize and plan all our activities making it exhausting sometimes, to the point of discouraging some members to stay
Apart from the catholic values we learn survival techniques, how to make fires, build a kitchen area, how to read and guide a military map, usually by games and workshops
I've done one of those activities where the kids go through a scary path, or we make like a game or a prank that they do not know about, we call it "Batismo de Campo" - Camp Baptism, to make the new kids welcomed to the group, ya know
Fun fact: There's a Portuguese Scouts group in Genève, as there are many Portuguese living there
I was a scout to (portuguese) and in 2014 we went to the  Kendersteg international camp in Switzerland and let me tell you, your country (in that region at least) has some of the most breathtaking and beautiful scenery I've ever seen
Like, unbelievable stuff really
We also align more with the swiss scouts rather than the americans, but in my group since most of the leaders were actually ex-military, we learned a lot of that too but we learned those technical military things in a very free way, there was nothing like an uptight atmosphere
I think we learnt good values like "desemerdanço", patriotism, volunteering and all that in a very healthy way, and the tasks we were given were always so much fun, we would gladly do them but there wouldn't be an obligation (it needn't be)
Also, most of what we did in camps was "raids", which means covering a long track in the wild for many hours, on foot, to get from a town to another (I'm talking towns with 20 people in them, at best), and always unattended during the way
I loved it there
Religious scouts in Portugal are divided in 4 group, depending on their age: lobitos (6-10yo), exploradores (10-14yo), pioneiros (14-18yo) and caminheiros (18-22yo)
After 22 you can sign up for a course that allows you to become a leader (Chefe) - I'm not really familiar with what is taught in this course by I think it includes things like pedagogy, so that the activities that the Chefes plan for the young scouts are age appropriate to their development as a child or teen
This allows for the activities to be fun and at the same time useful to develop social skill and team work, much like playing team sports
I've heard that being a scout ou at least having been a member for a period of time is valued when applying for a job for exactly that reason
It also teaches responsibility: as the kids grow older, they start to be responsible for organising a part of their activities, make the constructions when camping, cleaning and helping the younger ones when needed, though the Chefes are always present for whatever might be necessary
I was a member of the scouts for some years
I loved it and would recommend it anytime
Didn't feel it was too strict and the only similary to the military might be the clothes and boots and being "in formation" (not sure what it is called in English) when is time to give instructions or when in a ceremony, but that's probably because the scouts was created by a military man, some of those things stuck
I think besides the religious scouts (CNE, which includes the marine scouts) and the non-religious scouts (AEP), there's an organisation of girls scouts called "Guias" but I'm not familiar with that group
There is also maritime scouts I think but I don't know much about them
Some were found buried in the last century near my hometown
There's still preserved mosaics and paint, as well as other day-to-day items such as coins and farming material
I think the main building of the ruins was a public bath
In case you are curious, it's the ruins of Conímbriga
Yes allot aqueduct, irrigation systems (Hispania was the bread basket of the Roman Republic), Many roads, do not forget that most were built with local labor, they had the system to control all the salt mines (including gold mines the Douro river in oporto Literally translates golden river)
The salary comes from salt, which was paid for the work
When the Roman empire ended and the rest of Europe was in the dark ages
We were occupied by the Arabs (independent Arab nation) the entire infrastructure was revitalized So there is still a lot to be found
The village where my parents live still has a road and is small place
Yes, in Portugal we have some, for example [The ancient roman temple in Évora]
Yes do have a temple ruin on the city of Évora, in Portugal we also do have an entire city of Conimbriga (now named Coimbra) in ruins
They're pretty interesting and worth visiting landmarks
Many modern cities date back to the Roman times, Lisbon (Olissipo), Coimbra (Conimbriga), Braga (Bracara Augusta), etc
Plus, I think the most famous Roman ruins in Portugal is the temple of Diana in Évora
This one isn't ruins, but there's a story about the Portuguese river Lima where the Romans believed it was a mythical river which made anyone who passed it lose their memories, so a legion passing there was anxious to cross the river
The story says the General/Centurion/whatever had to cross the river alone and then called the soldiers name by name to prove he didn't get his mind wiped
Because of this story they have this (cardboard
I don't actually know what they're made of) legion in one side of the river and a general in the other side to honour the story I guess (Obviously we put it there, not the romans), it's next to the famous Ponte de Lima, the oldest town in Portugal, as in oficially being called a town, in 1125
Yep, and the bridges are still used to this day, one is right in my small village, only thing is that it is tarmacked
But it is still pretty well kept and bellow it can get a nice view, you can see some stuff that shows over time people have not tried to keep it untouched tho
There are tons of roman and pre-roman ruins here
Where I'm currently living in, when there is construction work on the historical center, there's always something that's uncovered
Currently they're trying to dig up the old roman forum
We also have a temple in Évora
[Quim Barreiros - Bacalhau à Portuguesa]
Any Quim Barreiros song is a guilty pleasure and a lot of us enjoy in Portugal
Well, now I know no one will take me serious but I love how genuine the Portuguese singer Marante is
He's some sort of "whorehouse poet", with his lyrics almost always covering issues related to husbands who neglect their wives while complaining they don't understand them
A lot is lost in translation but this is his anthem (Tough the original is not his but Brazilian):
The nightclub
Keeps up at night
a party mood
From afar you can hear
Various instruments
strings and metals
Bohemians drink
Singing and dancing
To the sound of the orchestra
A shrill sound
Who gave it the name
Crystal Sound
It's a nightclub
Spoken nightclub
Place of bad reputation
With the doors open
During the night
Enter whoever you want
But that night
Without me expecting
A lady came in
I was amazed
Because it was
my wife
She got tired
of sleeping alone
Waiting for me
And that night
Resolved to end
her long
And damned wait
She didn't want anymore
to lead the life
of an honored woman
If actually
It didn't help
to be a righteous woman
As she was
She chose
To abandon
The role of wife
to live
Among the butterflies
That make point
In that place
My life
Much more wandering
Now continues
I transformed my wife
In a street woman
In the youngest lady
of Crystal Sound
*repeat*
Another himn of his, now on a happier note:
A bela portuguesa ( The beautiful portuguese woman):
As a disclaimer, I love this guy because he his as kitch as anyone can be
Usually I listen to 80's new wave and metal eheheh
It was quite a success  over here at the time
É o prato preferido do povo de Portugal
> I don't know think you can get a more portuguese song than Quim Barreiros
Which is ironic, as most of his songs are covers of Brazilian songs
That our food is just excellent
From soup to desserts, we have it all
And, if you don't overeat,  it's also healthy
That Portugal is an actual country and not part of Spain ;)
That we are all poor and that our salaries should be higher
If you are Ukrainian, you surely work on construction
A large portion of us hates the Teachers Trade Union representative (FENPROF) Mário Nogueira
I watched the premiere on TV and didn't really like it, but last year I binged the show (not hard to do considering the amount of episodes) and loved it
It really is hilarious and I've been recommending it to other people (though you'd be surprised that I actually have to explain the Troubles to a lot of them)
I'm Portuguese and I hate Spanish food
Spanish food is so similar to ours
Do you hate Portuguese food as well
I agree on the superior bread
I literally ate pizza accompanied by some bread in Paris, because it was so damn good
Hard disagree on cheese and wine, sorry
I'm not talking about their national gastronomy, but when I ate at spanish restaurants or hotels, the food was just horrible
Are you suggesting that whatever the cheese, there is a similar, but better French cheese
To me that situation happened in reverse, i barely have any accent when speaking English, so it kinda sounds "normal" and a few tourists though i was English when I'm Portuguese
What gave it away
Not the person you're replying to, and I can't spot the exact signs of Spanish, but there's a lot of phrasings there that even a Portuguese person would write as well
Omitting the pronoun ("Lived" instead of "I lived"), the "has to be" (that's a direct translation of "tem de ser") and writing nationalities with a lower case initial, for instance
"Paid by card" also feels like a very literal translation, but I'm not so sure on that
An English native will obviously have a keener eye and spot more than this, but those three signs alone are a dead giveaway of someone who speaks a Romance language natively
I would imagine its probably not even legal in most of EU for a company to just leave packages outside / doorstep
Here, if it's the national mail they either deliver directly to you if you are home or leave a notice saying your parcel will be available at the post office for pick up from next day  when you are not home
Some other companies either call you or arrange with you a pick up spot
Leaving it on the porch just sounds absolutely mental lol
Nope, usually, if they can't reach you they'll take the package back and you can reschedule the delivery with most distributors
CTT Expresso (National mail service) however, most of the time, in my experience, they don't even ring your doorbell they take the package to the area's CTT store and leave a note in your mailbox for you to go and pick it up, which is super annoying but yeah
They will never leave it unattended
They either ring the bell and give it to you, or leave a paper that you can use to pick up your parcel at the closest post office/ whatever pick up place they have set up
Not a problem at all
That's when they even remember to ring your doorbell, god I hate CTT with a passion
The concept of milk is foreign to you
Never been to the UK but some Square headed bloke told me  I should probably say somewhere in Luton
Pilha = battery / Pila = dick
Coina = a town in Portugal / Cona = pussy
Carvalho = oak tree / Caralho = dick or fuck (depending on the context)
Sabão = soap / Cagão = someone that shits a lot
Cágado = a type of turtle / Cagado = shitted
Bolhão = a neigbourhood in Porto / Colhão = testicle
Sexto = sixth / Sexo = sex
Carvalho = oak tree
Caralho = rude word for penis (actually it is a nautical term meaning crow's nest, but in the past it became a synonyms for penis)
In portuguese
Carvalho = oak tree
Caralho = cock
For portuguese, I'd give the example of côco vs cocó. The first one means coconut, the second means poop
Here Ânus (Anus) and Anos (Years) are pronounced exactly the same way
It's the classic kids' favourite joke
"Quantos ânus tens
" (How old are you
"How many years/anuses do you have")
"Oito" (eight)
"hAHa, tENs OiTo rAbOs" ("haha you have eight butts
In Portuguese it's papá for dad (more like daddy), Papa for pope, and papa (no capital P) for mushy food/baby food
Portugal must be one of the most expensive countries to study in uni in the EU
For portuguese students public universities go around 800€ per year + dorms or outside accommodation
For international students it goes to like 3000 a year minimum depending on the university and what you are studying
We have scholarships for portuguese students that can cover most of the price of the tuition but it is never free
I understand that it's more expensive than our 800€ but let's remember that portuguese minimum wage is 635€ and a lot of families have to survive with only that
Here you don't get student loans
they are not really a thing
If you don't have money you just don't go to uni or work while studying which is really hard
Accommodation is like 250€ in the smaller cities and 400€ more or less in Lisbon and Porto + transport which is expensive as hell
So people really need a lot of money
Talking from experience I study 1h30 from my home town so I have a place near my university
I spend roughly 500€ per month
With the minimum wage being 630€ I could never study what I want were I want if my parents didn't help with the money
It is really sad here to see people that want to study and don't have the means to do it ://
Coffee
The common expresso goes for 60 cents in your average neighborhood cafe
Also, fruit
I don't know if it's the cheapest in europe but it is definitely the cheapest in western europe
Everytime I buy fruit outside Portugal I feel like I am burning money
Wine and cork
coffee, coffee is definitely cheaper being 0
60 cents, wine idk but i was told it was cheaper in comparison to some places in Europe (I'm not sure, pls correct me other wise)
Idk maybe pastries goods in coffee shops that you eat with your coffee or tea but i don't know so correct if I'm wrong
On side note does McDonald's change prince's in Europe
I am going to say wine and coffee
If you go to automatic machines an expresso can be as low as .20-.40€
Yeah well
sorry about that
How
I get 5GB for 13€ in Germany
I pay 8Gb For 15

Prego=> Steak with bread, not funny but it isn't just a beef with bread
Prego, one of many portuguese gastronomy inventions, one of my favorites of course
Eat it with Bolo do Caco, another excellent gastronomy masterpiece made by love and with love
Eating it only with that and some beef you bought at a supermarket close from home is not what it is meant to be and what it deserves to be
But here i'm gonna talk about the Prego I have seen in my region
The Prego I also prepare with joy most of the time
First beggining with the soft and crunchy Bolo do Caco and some "manteiga de alho" thinking is the original and perfect mix between the soft and the spicy, adds quite a lot to the food i'm reffering off
Well, now that we are talking about the ingredients, it isn't polite to leave the others behind the curtains, right
We then go down one level of the Prego, and we find the lettuce, maybe it is from your own garden or your own supplier, even your supermarket up close that sells it fresh and delicious
Prepared with salt, vinagger and oil like a salad, adds the healthy part to the meal, and a wonderfull one
After revieweing the lettuce we go find the next ingredient
A circled flavorful piece of  magnificient that turns it into a even more magnificient
Red and juicy with the typical seed in the middle, the tomato, making it a very beautifull and delicious set with the next ingredient
The beef, in my personal and not that much experient opinion, the most important part of the Prego
Mostly coming from a delicious and gorgeus cow, that has been living and eating in this terrific volcanic region
The beef itself it's, again, juicy and when tempered and cooked, it adds a excellent sensation in my mouth that everytime I eat, I never forget about it until I eat it again, just full of joy and excitement gets in my mind
You would be wondering what's next
For your insatiable curiosity, in this part comes the egg
From a supermarket or not, It is of great quality and that it comes
And where it comes it does a great chicken broth
Middly cooked and at a perfect temperature, middly hot and with the egg yolk still intact
And for the end, the optional ingredients
This is the part where every human that prepares this meal gets that creativity out of the head of the people and they start painting art in the food
Like some any people agree, food is an art and it is true
Pisca-pisca (turn signal lights) = blink blink

> Água mole em pedra dura tanto bate até que fura

Pretty understandable
Bonito compreensível
Hahaha what language
I think it's Gaelic (Irish)
Biggest dangers lie in the Sea
Probability the most dangerous, because it's the most likely, it's [the Portuguese Man O'War] or as we call it, "Caravela".
Probably wolves, but we have so few that they shouldn't even count
Wasps and ticks maybe
Edit: Portugal
How do I get a flair
Wolves of the Iberian kind and boars are dangerous but, you don't find many
There's a couple of species of venomous vipers but they aren't that common either
The dangerous animals that you can find everywhere are bugs, venomous spiders, small scorpions, centipedes and stupid mosquitos
Actually not
The most dangerous is the [Portuguese man o'war
] also known as "floating terror".
You need to go to r/askeurope and you have the option in the top right
Edit: typo
Well, they're not \*that\* few, there's about 300 or so
There's no attacks on humans on record, though
I'd say that, when considering mammals, wild boars are much more of a risk to people
And yes, ticks
Try to tell that to my brain
Cool, thanks :)
Was it the singing Bush from the Three Amigos
So, in Portugal we have a President and a Prime Minister
The president gets elected by the people, and the prime minister gets appointed by the president after he is elected by the Parliament
The prime minister runs the cabinet, and basically rules the country, while the president signs every bill into law (I think he can prevent bills from becoming laws twice, before they become laws with or without the president's support), and he can also fire the prime minister and/or dissolve parliament
The president only steps in when there is a severe crisis
In theory there is three powers that should be divided   and independent
Legislation, executive and judicial
In my country (Portugal) there's a parlament elected by people that has the legislative power
That parlament elects the government with a PM as a leader that holds the executive power
The judicial power his hold by judges (although the principal group of judges is nomited by parliament)
So if in theory all the powers should be independent they all came from one single election and if in theory we vote for a deputy from my zone we all aware that we are giving the power to the PM
So as a figure of control there's the President
He's elected by direct election and controls all the military force , etc
Normally the president is a person with a background in politics and with a greater consensus between all the parties
His role it's more to guarantee the constitution
he can say that he oppose to some governamental decision but he has to justify  that with the constitution and not has his opinion (that usually occurs 2-3 times in 4 years)
So his role could be most of the time just has a figure of consensus but when he has to make a decision it must be something important
I swear americans are just born half brain dead
Edit:
Portugal is basically a  parliamentary republic
It's true for Portugal that the President "appoints" the PM
but he basically just accepts and tells the candidate appointed by the wining party of the legislative elections to form a government
All the rest is like a parliamentary republic
Portugal it's a Parliamentary Republic
We elect President and parliament independently
PM and the government is suggested by the parliament to the President
A PM without parliament support does not  resist more than 15 days (it happened only once) so the oppion/decision of the President it's irrelevant to choose the PM
Dont know about the rest but Portugal doesn't really work like that
I didn't know that, but I also don't intend to have an EU flag
I don't even have a Portuguese one
Not at all
I don't even think most people here know there's an Europe Day
Same in Portugal
We don't even fly the Portuguese flag, let alone the EU one
They're only flown for football reasons
Shops don't put Portuguese flags in proheminent places at any time of the year because they know people aren't interested
The only exception was during Euro 2004, in Portugal
Back then, a lot of people (not me) put up Portuguese flags
I guess that's how you get Portuguese people to be patriotic, a combination of foreigners being here and football
"A gaiola dourada" (the golden cage TLdr it's about the a stereotypical portuguesa family that lives in France, it's wholesome, culturally funny, and portraits really well in general the Portuguese family dinamic not just the ones Portuguese immigrants
It was a bit of drama that I'm not going to spoil
It's a really good movie) or you could see "Variações" (TLdr it's about one of the most iconic Portugues rock star, António Variações, he was singer and song writer that came from nothing that became an icon for Portuguese rock even after his death he is beloved, we was basically a Portuguese version of Freddie Mercury literally but i don't mean has in copy but in terms of similarities lots of talent, gay, flamboyant/unic style of dressing, etc
The movie is really good)
"Sangue do Meu Sangue", by João Canijo is my Portuguese recommendation
Les Intouchables
He's not incompetent, in fact he's very competent he's just unwilling to work
Poland
I always wanted to see the Kremlin
Raid Tancos base
NATO Headquarters
Tancos
The Portuguese delegation are in, we’re pretty good at it
That’s how we got our independence back
Merkel
She's the only head of government that has a scientific background, and it shows
Despite her not being our actual head of government, she's Europe's mom and I actually worry a bit about what will be of us when she retires
Absolutely anyone who wouldn't treat the national treasury as an infinite funding for friends, family and economical groups with ties to the rulling party
We could make it if our governments saw the people as more than cash cows to be milked into oblivion to subsidise the " apparatus ".
I recall with a deep sense of nostalgia a prime minister we had that praised some nordic minister that resigned because she FORGOT to pay a 50 euro licence for a pier on a property she owned
That said prime minister said we needed politicians lie her in Portugal
That said prime minister was head of the most corrupt government we had in 45 years ( and we had a lot of corrupt ones), was charged, accusations droped and is enjoying his retirement in peace, as it always happens here
I dream of having then sort of corruption the UK has
That we can change the meaning of an adjective depending where we put it in a sentence
Say big (grande): if we put it behind the noun, it has a physical meaning, so "uma mulher grande" (a woman big), means the woman is big in size
If we put in front of the noun, then it takes on a psychological/moral meaning: "uma grande mulher" (a big woman), means a heroic, morally strong, important woman
Understanding nothing of Irish, I like that you guys don't have the words for "yes" or "no" for directly answering questions, and just agree/disagree by repeating the verb in the question
Portuguese, despite having "sim" as a valid answer, we rarely use it, and use the verb in the question as agreement (and is the only (western
) Latin language to do so as a default, iirc)
"Não" is more common, but only because it is used to negate the verb in the question anyway
"Passas muito tempo no reddit, não passas
" - "Passo
" : "*You spend a lot of time on reddit, don't you
" - "[I] spend
I agree
I also like that by adding negations we just compound the problem and meaning
Like the "feliz", "infeliz", "desinfeliz" setup, where you go from happy, to unhappy and then someone tragically or pathetically unhappy
We use h but it makes sound in conjunction with n, c or l .
Naked snail ahaha
Desinfeliz is not a word, is it
Arroz de cabidela, which is rice with the blood of the chicken
I've seen some negative reactions from foreigners concerning [*sopa de cavalo cansado*] (tired horse soup)
It consists of bread (usually corn bread), red wine, egg yolk, sugar and sometimes cinnamon as well
I'm not a big fan of it either to be honest
Also [Haggis] gets a bad rep, but it's delicious
It contains sheep's pluck (heart, liver, and lungs), minced with onion, oatmeal, suet, spices, and salt, mixed with stock, and cooked while traditionally encased in the animal's stomach, though now often in artificial casing instead (thanks wikipedia
I've heard that there are vegetarian variants of Haggis and that they're actually quite delicious
Need to try that at some point
Maybe dobrada .. it’s the stomach’s cow with beans
Even I don’t like it
It’s so gross
Caracóis (snails) it's similar to what the French have and eat, i suppose many other cultures don't have this habit of eating them ( well papered, of course, with cold beer) and might think its disgusting or gross
I personally haven't eaten them because it grosses me out a bit, although from what I've seen and been told a lot of people like it and say they taste really good
Pig blood sausage, chicken blood rice (so good
), pig blood soup covered with a layer of pepper, cow hoof soup, mutton brains with scrambled eggs
Well, in Portugal we have snails, “cows hand” with chickpeas, “arroz à cabidela” which is rice with chicken and chickens blood, cows stomach with beans
delicious
So damn good !!!
Ia mencionar isso
Pessoalmente, detesto
Também existe rechina ou moleja (rechina no Alto Alentejo e moleja no Baixo Alentejo)
Não sei se conhecem mas é uma sopa com miudezas de porco e sangue do mesmo
Também detesto
Aliás, todas as comidas com sangue são horríveis pra mim
Nah you've got great pies
May not be the fanciest food, but it's delicious nonetheless
I love snails, it is so good
Nunca pensei que a chô tôra Isabel dos Santos comesse arroz de cabidela
Miudezas com sangue
Mas não, nunca ouvi de tais pratos
>else you get those
Never aet snails, but people here either buy the ones served at small restaurants or tarven already pre made which from what i have been told are really good, or buy them in variety of stores be it a small store to the big ones
You probably got bad luck i guess
Omg agora percebi que este nickname é péssimo ahahah
Alentejanices
Hehehe
Não tens de quê! Mas já tem te acontecido alguma situação caricata ou algo
Se bem que eu gosto de morcela e leva sangue, aqui na minha zona a tradicional é a morcela de arroz (que é de longe a minha favorita)
Por acaso não ahah até porque o meu primeiro nome não é Isabel
Nunca provei
Nós sabemos, Risabel
That’s my true name
Very common
But we pronounce it as "ókay". Some people also pronounce it as "ókapa" (k in Portuguse is kapa)
Depends on the mood
Yes, it's pretty common, but we don't use it so much as an adjective, like in your first example
We use it more like in your second example though, and we use it a lot as a response to requests and stuff like that, as in "Don't forget to lock the door on your way out" "OK".
We usually pronounce the O in Portuguese and the K in English though
Though pronouncing the K in Portuguese is also done as a bit of a tongue in cheek thing
Very, even old people use it, it's just a normal word now, people don't see it as an english thing, I didn't even know it wasn't an original word in my language until very late
I've used it all my life, it's so common I didn't even know it was an English word when I was a kid
Even my grandma says OK
Nope "kkkkkkk" is Brazilian thing
We say "hahahaha ha" here instead
In Portuguese, "fim de semana" is Saturday and Sunday
A fellow countryman time-travels from 1919 to 2019 and asks you what happened to your country
What would you tell him
The Republic actually works now, trust me
Let's just forget the 50 years of dictatorship in between
Me: Bad economic policies and institutional corruption leads young men to emigrate
Him: Wtf the machine didn't work damnit
"Don't worry, we aren't fighting in the next one
Me: Don't worry, we're not going to participate in the second World War
We starved because the government sold our food, but at least we didn't fight in it
Brazilians are coming back though
BTW, Olivença is still Spanish ;)
OH and about the colonies
No more
But we try to be friends
To be fair, the Treaty of Versailles probably didn't help
\*Raises glass\*
Join the club, mate
Franco
Stalin
Hitler
You'll need to be more specific
Olá! :)
It has already started by you accepting Olivença instead Olivenza, now we will change the river course that defines the border slowly
At least that's what the 2119 timetraveler told me
Malta has a very rich history
The first time I was exposed to it was in the campaign of Age of Empires III
Sadly I don't know of many other stories that take place there
I wouldn't have known that the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was a thing if not for the internet
I wouldn't say it's overlooked, as there are better examples on this thread
People are very aware of Portugal, I think
But it is certainly underrated
We have this fame of being a small country or just being lumped together with Spain
But you know what, there's a nice moral to the story
It's like that poem "Ozymandias" by Percy Shelley
Such a big Empire, its influence lasted longer than the Soviet Union or the USA, and yet, no one remembers
No heroes, no villains, no achievements
No movies, no widespread media attention
Hitler and other megalomaniacs wanted a 1000 years "Empire". Well, look at Portugal
This is what 1000 years looks like
Kinda luckwarm
Is portuguese history overlooked
I mean the Crusades, the age of discovery, the slave trade
The language was definitely a surprise to me
I made friends with a Maltese girl during my master's and hearing her speak the language for the first time was fascinating, as it sounded so much like Arabic
And she was super fluent in English and Italian, and probably the first non-Portuguese person that pronounced my surname correctly on the first try
All the different traditions she spoke of also sounded fascinating, and it really made me want to visit the country (hopefully I can some day in the future)
I mean, if I tried to occupy a neighbour country and failed multiple times, I would not talk about it as well
Yeah I think my friend told me her parents watch everything dubbed in Italian
We also conquered Madrid for 40 days and had Galicia for three months, yet we never really learn about it
Lost it again some years later
What are the most modern looking places in your country
I consider myself very fortunate to have been born and to be living in Europe, and a big part of that is due to our cultural heritage
There are places in Europe that have remained (mostly) unchanged for centuries, and as such we can see a lot of examples of different architectural styles and movements
I love that so many major cities in Europe have done a great job at preserving buildings from their past
That being said, I'm a big fan of modern architecture and infrastructure as well
A lot of my favourite architects can be classified as "modern", such as Mies van der Rohe, Siza Vieira, Peter Zumthor, Zaha Hadid, Rem Koolhaas, and Tadao Ando (him especially)
I love seeing renders and proposals for modern infrastructure
I'd like to know what are the most modern looking places in your country
I know for instance that a lot of business/financial districts have a more modern look, as do a lot of places in cities such as Berlin and Rotterdam
What do you consider to be examples of modern infrastructure in your country
Are there any places that you feel look like they were ripped straight from the future
Probably Parque das Nações, in Lisbon
It is the neighborhood where I live, but this is an unbiased opinion
I love Rotterdam
The city center looks like an architect playground
So many interesting buildings everywhere you look
I came here to know what you'd think of the most modern place in Portugal, for I think it is the parque das nações too, and I don't live in Lisbon :) I love it though
Defenetly Parque das Nações
There is a village in Northern Portugal called Tó (an old Portuguese word for pig, and nowadays it's used as a shortened form of the name António)
I don't know if there are more two letters place names, but I would guess there are
The shortest city name is probably Beja, I think
There's one called 'Pó' (meaning 'Dust') not far from where I live
EDIT:
>The shortest city name is probably Beja, I think
Also, Faro
Horta could be the shortest, but Portuguese spelling rules insist on keeping these useless silent Hs at the start of the words
That's cool, why would they name the village Pó?
It would still have the same length as Beja though
Well, according to wikipedia:
> Segundo alguns autores, a povoação terá tomado o nome do apelido da família Pó, que tinha propriedades neste lugar, mas também se poderá admitir ter acontecido que esta família tenha assumido o nome da aldeia onde residia
So it's a possibility
Pior  imagina um gajo chamado Pó
Romanian is a no go
Italian is the second hardest, though I understand it better spoken than written
Spanish and french is kind of cheating because I do know them and can read it, slowly
Catalan I understand well sometimes, sometimes not
You forgot galician
Weird spelling they use though
Portuguese speaker here
I'd order it this way:
Galician- It's basically Portuguese with some Spanish words sprinkled in
Spanish- Almost all of the words are similar to Portuguese, and those that aren't, I either know or can easily infer what it's saying
Catalan, Italian and French- Many words are close to Portuguese, but I need to spend some time trying to read the whole phrase, and trying to get the context to correctly understanding it
Romanian- the first time I saw Romanian I was surprised how many words are similar
But it's a strange language
It starts to seem like Portuguese with a few strange symbols, but then it veers off, and a different word appears
While I do understand some words, I can no longer read the whole phrase
**French:** I could read practically everything (80%), but I also had 3 years of French during highs-school
**Spanish:** Understood 100%
**Italian:** Had to read more carefully and I didn't understand a few words, understood about 70%.
**Catalan:** the article was very short, but I was able to understand everything
**Romanian:** Had a bit more trouble, a bit more difficult than Italian, about 65%.
**Galician:** looks like a mix between Spanish and Portuguese, also understood 100%.
French, about 80%. Briefly talked about a theatre play and it's context
Spanish: 100%. A short line about a canadian judoka
Italian: 90%. An article about Ptolomy II, Egyptian Pharaoh from the Ptolemaic period
Portuguese: 100% (my first language)
An article about the colour red
Romanian: 20%. I understand the content - it's about Brazil, but I struggle to understand the words
Catalan: 100%. A short line about a Remomeix - a french municipalty
Galician: 100%. An article about the July Days (1917) in Russia
Portuguese here
Galician is the easiest by far
Nearly all the words have cognates with Portuguese and the word order is exactly the same
95% comprehension
Ironically, the Spanish article was about the "Italian economic miracle" (lol)
It was very easy to understand, but I guess that's a given
80% comprehension
Catalan is just slightly harder than Spanish, but fairly comprehensible nevertheless
75% comprehension
French was fairly easy to grasp, but I did learn the language in middle school
Even if I can't speak a word of it, I guess it still stuck
60% comprehension
Italian is surprisingly hard for me
I can understand what the article is about, but the details were nearly impossible
30% comprehension
Romanian is slightly harder than Italian and the hardest by far
20% comprehension
For a Portuguese Native Speaker like myself, Portuguese was the easiest (obviously), but putting it aside I would say Galician was easiest for me: it's really simillar to portuguese, and I could understood pretty much everything in the article (it just looked like portuguese but with some spanish flavour added in, like spanish vocabullary and different spellings)
Spanish was the 2nd easiest, as it's also very close to portuguese, although less than Galician
The 3rd easiest was Italian, although it might be because lf the article's subject being easy to understand (planet earth)
In 4th place is the French article, which I mostly understood well, except for the word "passacadillo" or something like that, but besides that I could understand everything if I put in enough effort
In 5th was Catalan, this is sort of a hard language in the Romance family because it combines the parts of spanish and french that portuguese people don't understand so well
The article was very short though, it was just one paragraph, so maybe it depends on the article
Finally Romanian was the hardest by far: I understood little to none of the article, I only know that it's about The Night of the Living Dead" because it said the english movie title in the article, otherwise I wouldn't get it
I understood everything in the Spanish one, the Italian one and the French one, which opened up (convienently) a page about that famous painting of Napoleon on his horse crossing the Alps, which I also understood thoroughly
I had some trouble with Catalan and Romanian
Surprisingly, I understood everything written in Portuguese
Fantastic
> Gallego: a former province of portugal,
No, LOL
You say that Spanish and Italian are very similar but, as a Portuguese (fluent in French too), I understand 95% of Spanish but I find Italian difficult to read
Or is Russian drunk Portuguese
Hmm
Salvaterra do Minho maybe, it is just a town
Calling it a province would be extremely misleading
Portuguese translations of books keep the original names of characters
Based on the rest of this thread, this might seem strange to some people
(This comment doesn't apply to the Brazilian Portuguese translations
In Harry Potter, instead of changing the character's name to fit the language, "Tom Marvolo Riddle" still unscrambles to "I am Lord Voldemort" written in English and there's a footnote translating that to Portuguese
Planet of the Apes -> O Homem Que Veio Do Futuro (The Man From The Future)
The Girl Who Played with Fire -> A Rapariga que Sonhava com uma Lata de Gasolina e um Fósforo (The Girl Who Dreamt Of A Gas Can And A Match)
Lock Up -> Stallone Prisioneiro (Inmate Stallone)
Not always unfortunarely
ASoIaF is an example of translated names/cities that went terribly wrong
Brazilian Portuguese translations*
We, for the most part, keep the original names and spelling
I wish they had kept the original names there, specially considering they did keep some names because they didn't have an obvious translation
That being said, they translated some city names but not character names, so my previous comment is still technically correct
Wont argue much more but your comment is not correct
Maybe older editions do what you say, but not new ones for sure
Been that way since the 50's, I think
> surprised Portugal is different in that regard
Maybe it's related to the fact that we also subtitle instead of dubbing, initially to keep people from watching too many foreign movies (since they couldn't read), but later on kept to help language (English) learning
Plus, smaller European countries traditionally sub instead of dub
I know it's not correct for everything (the names of many Asterix characters were translated) but, as far as I know, none of the character names in ASOIAF were translated
Cities aren't characters and nicknames of characters aren't character names
Not all
If you read A song of Ice and Fire they have translated cities like Kings Landing to Porto Real
That is why I've read the originals instead of the translations
Well, not only that, they have also edited 5 of the original books and turned them into 10 books
I mean, it sucks if a historical building like that is lost forever, but I wouldn't say I feel like it's a personal loss of mine
I'm not French
Kinda both foreign and losing, strange
Its sad
People here love to honk in traffic must be a souther European thing
They honk over minor stuff
I remember when I was in taking my driving licence in the driving lessons people honk at me, I was not making mistakes was just being a bit low because I was learning how to drive
Not sure if this applies to all Bulgarians, but I had a friend who I met during my master's and she could be blunt and tell it like it is, but in a way that never came across as mean or rude
I absolutely loved that about her
It was like a reverse of all the unnecessary euphemisms you sometimes come across in the UK
Same with me taking driving lessons
You'd think people would be more understanding but they really don't care
Hahahahaha
You know
Lmao if anything they usually say the opposite
Yeah I had it drilled into me that I should always look at my mirrors when exiting a roundabout
But what I meant with my comment is that I've had instructors tell me that bad driving habits are something you should leave until after you get your license
As in "focus on driving impeccably until you've passed your exam, after that you can bend the rules a little".
Ehm, everyone "insults" their own country but if someone's insults we start fighting, so I guess the hate for the capital is normal
The vatican city
Lisbon i guess
Like people from Porto have a rivalry but when they meet the city they end up liking it (generally speaking)
The problem with this question is that is there always someone who dislikes a city for no reason and its not only 1 person its multiple people who then can influence their irrational opinions on others
Naaah, if someone says they don't like Lisbon I'm right there with them
Gotta give us jobs ;)
Mhmmm, I prefer Barcelona cuz I never went to Madrid sorry :/
We had a few fallen governments
Mostly they've fallen vecause of money, budget
The last one was in 2011 when our lovely corrupt social democratic prime minister kindly helped tank our economy leaving us no choice but to get an international bail out
Guess which party was back in power 5 years later and has been since
Liberal surge
Well, that depends on your age
No one expects an old person to speak anything other than Portuguese, especially if they don't have much education
As for younger people, you're expected to at least be able to understand English
Most people know a second language, and tend to be fluent with that second language, only the older generation are the exception
It's seen has a valuable trait since Portugal is an international and diverse country, we have a lot of tourists and we tend to be helpful with anyone in need so communication is important
It's also a valuable trait since a lot of Portuguese people migrate (even in the most unlikely places on this earth there's Portuguese, we are everywhere)
I'm not sure if a major part of the younger generations understands well English
For people who have at least a bachelor degree I would say almost all of them are fluent in English, but I found that people who have never been to university are likely to struggle understanding English
I had several classmates at uni who didn't exactly excel at English either to be honest
I don't think it's that linear
Spanish is taught in Portugal, it’s not mandatory like English is
We can choose between French, German and Spanish
Also, Portuguese isn’t mandatory in Spain as well
No, not really
It's not compulsory
Only English is
And French used to be as well
You can learn a third optional language here, and you could choose Spanish
But spanish is extremely similar to portuguese, if both parties speak slowly we can sort of communicate
I see why you would think that we would learn Spanish, but the funny thing is that our countries exert surprisingly little influence on one and other
Although we are from the same roots and are very similar, historically we have been somewhat separated
Here's an example of what I'm trying to say: I know many people who have worked in France, or emigrated to the UK, but not that many with a history with Spain
The thing is you have English as a mandatory language from very soon, since primary school until you finish high school
Nevertheless, you reach the 7th grade (age of 12/13) and you have to choose a second language to learn until high school
Normally you have 3 possibilities: French, Spanish and german (in high school some schools may offer you italian or even latin)
I guess most of students choose french, because it's useful and we have lots of portuguese communities in French speaking countries (France, Belgium, Switzerland or Luxembourg)
Other students may choose Spanish because it's easier and people here normally know the basics of spanish because it's much similar
No one really choose to learn german
But I think if you ask a random portuguese which second language he speaks better first would be English, second would be French and just after these two would be Spanish
It's actually more common to learn French than Spanish here
It's not mandatory and it's also not really need since we can pretty much understand each other for the most part, English is mandatory, other foreign language are optional and we tend to choose overwhelming French over the options between Spanish, French or German
My experience from university says that not everyone excels at it, not everyone is 100% fluent but everyone should at least understand and are able to speak the basics
I've never met anyone at university who didn't understand english
I think most young people understand the basics
Tons of people I've met in my school days who had bad grades at English were still able to enjoy music in that language and understand the gist of it
They had a passive understanding of the language but struggled at speaking it themselves and also made a lot of grammatical mistakes
I'm gonna guess when it comes to university it will depend a lot on the degree a student is pursuing
In a humanities degree you'll definitely need good English skills since a lot of the material you'll be studying for tests/exams and writing essays about history, sociology, economics, anthropology, philosophy, political science, etc
is in English
Still, I had several classmates in my degree that weren't fluent in the language and needed to Google words or check the dictionary for their meaning
I guess in a degree that's heavier on math you can get by more easily without being fluent in English
I know right
It's pretty weird
My degree is in economics (also heavy in maths), but we started to have classes in English since very soon, which helps a lot
But still most of the professors would let you make a presentation or do the exams in portuguese, so if you struggled at english, that would not cause you a big trouble
And tbh why would you guys even need to learn Portuguese
It really isn't that useful of a language
Ah well Economics is considered a social science, even though it has a lot of maths
I was thinking more in the line of engineering degrees, architecture, mathematics bachelors, accounting and finance, etc
Yes
Just like it would be to open their closet and drawers
Same in Portugal
Portugal and Spain have had its fights, but still are the closest they could be (one could say they are the same, don't kill me please)
I have a spanish right next to me that begs to differ(portuguese here) but yes i know what you mean, but still we are so close
Do you consider yourself more of a galician than spanish
(Pardon my questions)
Do you feel like that's a feeling shared with the majority of the galicians
That's very interesting
Is there any such thing as independence movement, the likes of catalonia
José Manuel Durão Barroso
Opportunistic parasite and I would like to have it impossible for him to ever get the prestige of the presidency
At the same time, I am curious to see what my Portuguese companions would do with him in elections
But then I remember they voted a second turn on Cavaco Silva and yeah, lets not risk it
One of those assholes at TAP or Novo Banco that instead of trying to actualy run a good business they just suck up all of our tax money and share it with their friends
This right here wins the Portuguese comments
Don't you think the problem is in the politicians that actually enable them to do this and keep giving them more money ? (Cough cough Costa cough cough )
At least one of those is loyal to his ideals (I'm not supporting him in anyway tho)
Exactly this ^^^
Have you ever heard of the House of Lords
Yes
We have a very comprehensive list of names allowed (though imo it´s getting way too lenient)
One way to spell a name and no gender neutral names
Ahhhh we also have a few rules in Portugal
there's lists with banned names, honestly it's pretty shitty for immigrants registering their children here
I'm a big fan of the system here in Portugal, every child deserves to grow up with a normal name imo
I believe they've become more lax with names in recent years, at least with regards to foreign names
I know a young couple with a child named Kevin, and a girl I know recently had a child which she named Luke
The gendered name helps with identification on formal documents without we actually having to look at the person
It just avoids a lot of complication
Besides, Romance languages - and most other European ones, too - are gendered on itself
In Portuguese, just by saying "thank you", people will know your gender immediately
EDIT: I guess French is an exception, judging by another comment
The names in the list are mere examples of valid names and only applies if the child is born in Portugal with no foreign parents
Otherwise, they can name their child according to their nation rules
Source:
The thing is that around European countries we don't have the tendency to recreate names, they're usually pretty straight forward
We may import, but normally we all kind of agree that it's best to pick decent names
>  but not a living sibling's name
I don't think you can use a dead sibling's name either, here
unfortunately sometimes monstrosities like Lyonce Viiktórya will still get aproved
ohhh did not know that part, nonetheless many portuguese parents have gone onto the "foreign-name" attempt and then it's refused
Are these guidelines any recent
I know a handful of people (most if not all not even descended from migrants) whose names would break one of these rules
Similarly in Portugal you'd have to give a name from the God parents
(In Portugal we often use two first names so you can circumvent it though)
>unfortunately sometimes monstrosities like Lyonce Viiktórya will still get aproved
Because one of the parents is not Portuguese
Foreign parents have leeway
It is weird, because Yannick Djaló is Portuguese, he even played for the national team, their mother is Portuguese, and yet they accepted the names
Ahahah those sound like knock off brands
Not exclusive to formal documents; it's just a good piece of information to infer by just seeing the name of the person
It avoids awkward situations in communication
Like, if you writing an email to someone you just know the name of and never seen physically, you'll still be able to tell which gender to use in your writing
EDIT: Just to clarify: Romance languages are gendered
That means every time you use an adjective, for instance, you need to alter the suffix in accordance to the gender of the noun it's referring to
So, to say a woman is **tall** you'd say "alt**a**", but to say a man is tall, you'd say "alt**o**".
Some people are just plain stupid
I feel like some names that are proposed would only hurt the child in the future
I think they've relaxed the rules somewhat because I know some people who've given their children foreign names (like Kevin and Luke)
But Yannick Djaló is Portuguese, he even played for the national team
he's a dual national with Guinean citizenship, I think
The question asked "does any of the parents hold any nationality not Portuguese
" And Yannick is (probably) also a Guiné Bissau citizen
Wiki tells me he was born in Guinea-Bissau
Not sure if they're the best, but I quite like the CCB (Centro Cultural de Belém) and the Calouste Gulbenkian Museum in Lisbon
In my opinion, I'd say Museu Gulbenkian, in Lisboa
Of all the Museums in Portugal, my favorite is the Museu Gulbenkian
[Museu Nacional the Arte Antiga] has it has a beautiful collection of art in Lisbon
Amazing
It's very beautiful
O Museu Gulbenkian é uma coleção privada super pequena
Será este mesmo o melhor museu de Portugal
Se calhar não, mas é o meu favorito
A colecção Gulbenkian não é assim tão pequena, acho eu
My parents sometimes speak to each other in English at family gatherings
My sister and I sometimes do the same when we're at our grandparents' house
My mom used english
Which o now know as good/better than her
Yeah my parents would speak in English when me and my siblings were young
Depends on the scenario
I used to start speaking in English until I realized that's actually rather rude
That being said, if the person is really struggling to communicate then I ask if we can speak in English instead to speed things up a little
It can be a counterproductive specially if they learn brazillian and are trying to use it with a foreign accent on top (I actually get totally confused about if trem is train or tram and just please, english)
But then there is a special class of tourist who try very hard to use their spanish as a foreign languahe in Portugal
Often they speak english as their native language
Spanish is close, but it is different enough in 5% of the words to totally throw you in a spin, and foreigners who learnt spanish they never ever understand spoken Portuguese back, so please please, english if you do not mind
Spanish is much harder and then they do not understand what I speak
I can not speak spanish, I can understand it, with a lot of stumbling blocks, but I understand english soooo much better
The smell of smoke of burnt pine and eucalyptus trees
The smell of the sea, some beach on the south west coast
Salt, iodine, and wind, and some herbs maybe
My country would smell of the Atlantic
Or of pine trees, or of rosemary, or of oregano, parsley and coriander
I was expecting someone would say port wine or grilled fish but that just makes me sad
With a little hint of salty codfish and dry weeds ( codfish for the whole nation and dry weeds for those areas that usually don't burn - Alentejo)
On a more positive note: traditional towns in Portugal do have a distinctive smell
Areas of Lisbon smell like Basil and White-Blue soap
That smell overwhelmes every other smell, unfortunately
Don’t forget fig trees
Or of apples and wine, and of good comforting food
This make me sad too
It's depressing to see the country burn every summer
Yeah, everyone is saying good smells from their country and I say this hahaha
Port wine or grilled fish are great and represent Portugal really well
Yes unfortunately
Wildfire are extremely common, the biggest tragedy in modern Portuguese history is the 2017 Pedrogão wildfire which killed 60+ people in an afternoon
Apart from the costal towns and cities everything is going down population wise
The biggest issue is the lack of access to education and medical services seeing that a lot of primary schools get underfunded for lack of students and then eventually shut down making kids travel to other villages or having to go to the closest city for education
I'm from a district capital in the interior and even the hospital can't do several thing because they simply don't have the equipment
For instance cancer treatments you'd have to travel about 150km to do it because if there isn't a lot of people living in the city you don't really get a lot of support
The desertification of the interior is a big issue here and the government tries to help but what you get is just a very very boring day to day without many things to do or try so you just fall into the Portuguese routine of going to work and going home and to the cafe inbetween
Adult population around 80 percent
We might fall from 10 million in a few years
Big demographic crisis
HALF OF THE POPULATION IN THE 2 BIGGEST DISTRICT CITIES (Porto, Lisbon) Lisbon still grows but the interior is getting deserted quick
Damm you Spaniards
Always with your ambition to conquer us
You will fail e every time
Come forward Portuguese Baker women, destroy the Spanish army
/s (joke)
Once upon a time
You were thinking about us in the past
Or in the future (hopefully in the future if the economy gets better)
[Well, about that
That is a comic from 1958
Prussia hasn't been a thing since 1871 if you consider the unification of Germany, 1918 if you consider their change from a kingdom to a state within Germany after the collapse of the constituent monarchies of the country (or what was the German Empire at the time) following the German Revolution
>1918 if you consider their change from a kingdom to a state
I was referring specifically to the kingdom itself as a nation
The Free State of Prussia was fully incorporated into the Weimar Republic and was one of its federal subjects
I'd have to say Lisbon - London - Berlin - Vienna - Budapest
But I've got to tell you that, and this might have been just me having a bad experience, but if are to visit either Vienna or Budapest, keep your head down, I'm European and I've had people, let's say, not be that welcoming to me in both cities
They're beautiful cities nonetheless, tho
Porto *is* special
Wien is the absolute best
I go back every year in the Winter
I hope COVID doesn't ruin it for me next time
Sagres, wow
Beautiful, but didn't expect to see it here ️
Can confirm, Porto is indeed super beautiful
That's debatable
If one wants to visit less touristy cities sure but is Liverpool more interesting and representative of the UK (and Europe) than London
For instance I loved Cork but if I had to pick one city for someone that's going to visit Ireland for the first time I'm still choosing Dublin
Oh no, it's not about crime, at all, at least not that kind
The thing is the, I don't want to say "racism", bcs I don't feel it was just that, at least in Hungary, but what happened was that, (I was in the two cities like one after the other, btw) in Vienna, me and my Portuguese friend had two incidents with older people calling workers inside the train, telling him to ask us to get out of the train or move to a different carriage
The last one was the worst tho
We were with a German girl we'd met a few days earlier and when the old chap came to us and starting saying some shit to our faces, she intervened
I speak very little German, but I heard "blah blah blah Jude blah blah" (Jude means Jew, in German), and when we asked what he was saying to her, she said he was being very disrespectful towards us, specially to me (I'm Jewish, obviously)
In Hungary we were outright intimated to leave like a restaurant/bar by a group of guys in black saying that we didn't belong there, which was kind of terrifying
I believe those to be isolated incidents, but they did still happen and I didn't feel a bit comfortable
Apart from that, younger and not bald blackshirt people seem to be quite nice
It's a bit expensive
But to give you and idea, all included (travel, hotel and expenses) I spend around 1100-1200€ for 5 nights for 2 persons
The hotel is nothing fancy, but it's decent
I go to restaurants: 1 meal in a fancier restaurant, the rest in any other
I buy Mozart chocolates, Sachertorte and Apfelstrudel, Kaiserschmarren, etc
I visited some museums, and monuments (but don't any more, because there's none that interest me and that I haven't seen)
I go to Prater amusement Park (ride the giant wheel and play some arcade), and I always go ice-skating near Rathaus
And I still bring some souvenirs
The only thing whose price truly shocked me was the Espresso, because I'm used to pay no more than 0
60€ in Portugal
There are some major attractions, such as the Opera, that are very expensive
I guess Winter makes it cheaper
But I think it's best: I've more than enough heat and Sun in my country, plus the streets during that time are nearly empty
Bottom line: it's not much at all if you really like to go there and can save some Euros throughout the year
In Portugal, Delta is the most popular, and for me it's the best tasting brand
But it also depends on the machine where the expresso is made
Delta ruby type
Far the best one I ever tasted in Europe
The Italian ones are good too but i think delta has a little more flavors in their coffees
Portuguese coffee is VERY underrated
Delta and Sical are absolutely delicious and it’s what I miss the most when I’m traveling
The only country I’ve been that has similar quality coffee is Italy
Delta is considered by many a quality coffee, and in my opinion far surpasses many other coffees I've tasted
A surprinsigly good coffee machine of portuguese make is the [Dimobilli] the ground coffee option makes extremely good expressos
I used to buy Intermezzo because of its excellent price/quality but had to quit buying it because more often than not I would find small twigs, sometimes more than one in a 500g package
You buy a pack of Delta, and when it says produced it says his full name "Manuel Rui Azinhais Nabeiro", and the Campo Maior address
His full personal name is on every package and yeah, he could care if it was no good
That coffee machine makes THE BEST coffee, life changer
And it’s very cheap too
It is, and it comes with 3 different accessories so you can use ground coffee, capsules or coffee pods
How arrogant do you have to be to tell an Italian, from the country that invented espresso, who probably drinks a few every day since they were a teen, that Illy or Lavazza is not a coffee shop
Seriously
I'm Portuguese my wife is Russian we both live in Portugal
Biggest difference while dating was the fact that Russian woman care more about old fashion gentleman behavior than Portuguese, we meet 4 yrs ago start living together 2 yrs ago and we marry around 1 yr
Our relationship in the last 4 years is going great
Both of us have emotional and direct personality but even in the times that we quarrel we end up making peace in 1 hour maximum
My parents love her, and when I meet her parents in Russia they were always very friendly to me
Even if two people come from different cultures, as far as they respect each others space and devide home tasks, everything will go fine
I dated a swedish girl for 8 months it was really good especially seeing how different our cultures was
I enjoyed learning about their culture and now I kinda want to live there
I'm dating a Czech guy
It's been very interesting
He works remotely so he's with me in Portugal for most of the year and then goes back to Czech usually in the winter and a bit of summer
The biggest difference has been the food for sure
He says our food is amazing but our beer is shit
While for me I have a bit of hard time eating their recipes because they are far heavier than I'm used to, loads of potatoes, oil and heavy sauce
Another thing I noticed is that they are much more independent from their family
Here families are quite close and it's normal for people to live with their parents until their late 20s, have family lunches on the weekend and so on
There kids do whatever they want and are expected to be married and with kids of their own in their early 20s.
I've enjoyed learning a lot about his culture and showing him mine
Visiting each others countries is always lots of fun
The different language has been an interesting challenge
Trying to get his mom to like me when she doesn't speak a word of English was nerve wrecking but apparently she really likes me (somehow) so that's a win
And I would say the biggest challenge was right at the start, more than "typical" relationships, there was more missteps and miscommunication due to the cultural differences which we had to overcome by communicating more explicitly than is typical, before we were fully confortable with each other
Please tell me she wears a beret
Yup we in south Europe think that lunches that end up as dinners are normals until someone tells us that they aren’t
Hhahga e um cafézinho também
Can only speak for Portugal but I think it's also due to the language barrier
Like with my Portuguese friends we make a lot of subtle and sarcastic jokes
A lot of observational humour
And I do that with native English speaking friends as well
But I've been in situations were I've had both types of friends together and if the native English speaker makes a witty remark or subtle joke the Portuguese friend won't find it funny despite understanding English
I think a lot of the subtlety is lost depending on your grasp of the language
An English tourist was trying to ask for a muffin in Portuguese
She was supposed to say "quero um queque", but she ended up saying "quero uma queca", which means "I want sex".
I'm Portuguese, in middle school when we started learning French, some students wouldn't shut up about merci bom cu, almost identical to French pronunciation and some had a thick accent so many of us would always laugh even if they didn't mean to
Well, there's a funny mistake that happens when Portuguese people try to speak Spanish
The words embaraçado/a (PT) and embarazado/a (SP) are very similar, however, the first means embarrassed and the second means pregnant
They sound exactly the same in Portuguese, so a common childish joke is to ask someone their age, "Quantos anos tens
" ("How many years do you have
"), and say you answer 15 they begin to laugh and say you have 15 anuses
Context is everything
Not really
Normally after the elections there's some analysis by age and it's mostly: young, working age and pensioner
We usually don't name every generation
Historically only a handful ever get names, most don't.
Modern examples:
Like our generation from the early 90s (94-95) was named "geração rasca" = trashy generation
The generation of the economic crisis (around 2008-2011) was named "geração à rasca" = struggling generation
[wiki source]
It depends on country, for example here in Portugal no one cares about boomers or generation y and z etc
Now in the context of political and social issues we kinda talk about age discrimination although it doesn't receive enough attention (like people around 50 that are far from the retirement age but can't get a job because of their age or the young adult not being able to get a job in their areas of study because every job asks for experience but they don't have it because they are looking for a first job, or the fact that at age 16 you are criminally responsible but can not vote including emancipated minors that might be married working and paying taxes but can't participated in the political discussion [on side note this is debated in law especially fundamental rights classes, BTW law student, my position at either put the criminal responsibility to 18 or give at very least the right to vote at 16 to emancipated minors]) or to the rapid loss in young people and the problems that occurred to the social security because of ageing population, etc
In Portugal, in Porto (North of Portugal) have a lot of abandoned houses that are closed with bricks because usually drug addicts used to live in the places that where already abandoned
I sometimes imagine when i pass on one of those buildings that if someone was forgotten there and never could go out from there
The other place and one of the well known from here, similar to the case of Le Vele in Italy, we had a neighborhood called Bairro do Aleixo that was almost completely controlled by drug trafficking and it was like a drug market for people who wanted to buy
The towers were suffering degradation and the atmosphere was really scary
People would inject in plain sight in that place and stuff
Determiners: o and a
Conjunctions: e (means "and")
Then there's: ó, which is an interjection, when you're calling someone (v.g. Ó Carlos
= Hey Charles
(In archaic portuguese it used to be the contraction of a+o, which we nowadays write "ao", meaning "to", even though many accents still pronounce it "ó")
There's also: à contraction of a+a, meaning "to" as well
And then, there's é - which means is, verb "ser" (to be) third person conjugation, present simple
'' é '' which means '' is ''
Portuguese:
A/O - The
e - and
a - to / female form of the
o - male form of the
à - contraction of a (to) and a (female form of the)
e - and
é - is, as in he is, she is
ó - oh, hey you
And in Mirandese they have l - male form of the
e-and
a-the(feminine)
o-the(masculine)
(portuguese btw)
Thats basicaly it
> why is it spelled this way
It's a french loanword
Only if you're bragging about it
Complaining of how little we earn is almost a national pass time
I don't mind talking about it with my friends and family but I don't think I'd bring up that conversation with anyone else (unless for financial advice)
If they don't want to talk about it that's fine but I don't see it as a taboo subject
I don’t think it’s rude, we’re always bitching about it
I would say it’s tasteless to say specific numbers, but not rude
Green olives by far
In restaurants you are always given green olives as appetizer
I only see black olives in pizza
Edit: I just talked to family and friends and it seems that black olives were more popular in the olden times because they are easier to make
Green olives need to be treated to not taste like crap, and can be a byproduct of Olive oil production
According to my southern portuguese family, green olives are now much more popular in the South than in the North
My knowledge from the North is not the best so I assumed it was the same all over the country, sorry
depends on the dish, doesn't it
fish is usually accompanied by black olives and meat dishes by green or cut brown olives
at least when dishes are prepared in a restaurant
when at home, black olives are the default as to not complicate things
And in Alentejo
They produce a lot of olives, and when I go there, I always find as  green as black olives
In Santarém green olives are the most popular  they are given as appetizers in restaurants and everyone i know likes them better than the black ones , even though I prefer them
You get the olives (and bread, cheese, sardine paste,etc
) but you need to pay
If you don't want the apperizers you can just say no and they take it from the table
A lot of turists are tricked in to thinking that it is free and when they are paying they realise the extra € they were not anticipating
So, if you go to Portugal and don't want the appetizers just say so, but if you want them you are going to pay (but its not expensive)
This is an interesting question
they come up in the news, but its nothing really awesome, at least that I can remember
at the same time I think that, generally speaking, we don’t care much about space relate news
The Portuguese president is mostly a figure head and is a representative that always should try and promote debate
He has the power to "nuke" the parliament and veto laws, but if he abuses veto power he's gonna grow largely unpopular and never be reelected (they also need a justification for it, but most of the times it's "there hasn't been enough debate") . He can't pass laws by himself, only the ones that have been passed in the parliament
He's also the one that sets the date for the parliamentary elections
I think the true balance of power doesn't come exactly from the President / Prime minister relation, but largely from the Parliament power
Here the president appoints the Prime Minister, but that's basically defined by whatever the Parliament elections turn out to
And he has the power to dissolve the government and/or the Parliament altogether
Another powers include being the head of the military, even though the ministry of defence is where the authority comes from in practice
The president has the power of veto over whatever the Parliament approves, but can only do so one
If the Parliament decides again to approve the exact same law again, it can't be vetoed
Only the constitutional court can then rule something unconstitutional
Other than that, it's the usual background politics, mostly
Keeping parties talking, etc
I really like our political system
I think it achieves balance via the Parliament
We have 10 parties represented, and there isn't the feel that there is one point of absolute power
Only the rare case of absolute parliament majority, but even that doesn't feel as "absolutist" as presidential systems
Parliaments, people, parliaments are the most important democratic tool
Exactly
The only area where the President and the Government actually share power is Diplomacy
Everything else is basically just oversight
Just a side note
>Before that Vigdis Finnbogadottir (world's first female prez)
I have seen other Icelanders saying this before
She was the first to run on her own for president and being elected, that is correct
But she wasn't the first female president worldwide
There were a few before
The Soviets had quite a few in their republics
The first in a democratically elected position was Isabel Martinez de Peron, Argentina, but she was elected as VP and inherited the role
Yes, they do
And they take public transportation if the autarchy sponsored transportation isn't available
In Portugal Kids go to school alone round 14 yrs old
In my area, unless they have public transportation paid by the municipality, the parents will drive their kids to school
There's some irrational fear of leaving the kids on their own, that everything is super dangerous nowadays
I would say that happens, in big cities, if the school is nearby – close walking distance, that is
If not, parents will take the kids
In smaller cities, AFAIK kids go to school on their own
I live in Lisboa and teach in a school in Loures
Many parents take their kids to school but, i come across my students in the bus sometimes and I find younger children too
When I take the bus in Lisboa I find many children too, some younger than 10
I live in the countryside, and the bus that takes the students to school it's the normal public transportation bus, where the municipality pays the monthly tickets for the students that live more than 3km away from the school
Besides them only elderly people takes the bus, because public transit is so scarce, that it can be quite difficult to live without your own car
So, it kinda feels like a school bus, when in reality isn't. But I really mean it, when I say that people here are always complaining that things are getting more dangerous, "ninguém respeita nada nem ninguém", I think that's a CMTV effect
Yeah, CMTV is full of bandits, kidnappers and shady drug dealers
Lisboa is easier and safer in that aspect
Our country, as a whole, is quite safe imo
It's in third place in the safest countries list
It's a safe place
I never worried too much
When my kid was young, he played outside, in the park, around our building, without much supervision since he reached 8 years
And from 12 years old on he comes and goes as he pleases
He's trustworthy and never misses school or his school work
Doesn't drink or smoke
If he shows up to eat and sleep, I'm OK
Most sober
Albania, Bosnia or any other country with sizable Muslim population
Most secular
I'd say either Estonia or Czechia
Have lifetime danish friends, can confirm: The Danes will drink like there's no tomorrow, then get up the next day and do it again
I can only assume their livers are permanently encased in alcohol, which keep them in stasis
Note to self, make some Finnish friends
It's hard to do, because the fuckers don't seem to come down here, makes it hard to start a conversation
We learn medieval Galician-Portuguese poetry (which usually were made into songs sung at court)
Honestly, it's not that different from modern Portuguese
At first glance, it might be hard to understand the meaning, but eventually you'll get there
I actually enjoyed learning it
There are three forms of this poetry: Cantigas de Amigo, which are about a young women in despair because of her loved one, Cantigas de Amor, about low-born men who fall in love with a high-born lady, and Cantigas de Escárnio e Maldizer, which are essentially Medieval Diss-Tracks
(I remember one called "Ugly Lady". The backstory was that the women was jealous of the troubadour because he always composed songs about how beautiful other ladies at court were, but never about her
She demanded him to write a song about her
He wrote a song about how ugly she was
Ptsd flashbacks from  portuguese high school classes intensifies
Wait, really
What year
I don't remember ever learning that
Then again, I left school in 2007
Here's the Cantiga Dona Fea
Typo
Thanks for pointing that out
Using loanwords that are usually shortened in Portuguese
One that's common in several languages is saying "mail" instead of "e-mail" which is fine in Portuguese because "mail" alone has no other meaning, but in English "mail" doesn't mean the same as "e-mail". Same with "phones" for earphones/headphones, and I'm sure there's others I can't think of right now
And there's some grammatical ones like:
Not changing word order for questions, e.g. "You are coming
" instead of "Are you coming
Asking just the name of a person or thing to ask where it is, e.g. "The car keys
" instead of "Where are the car keys
Comparatives with "more" for every adjective, e.g. "more bright" instead of "brighter".
Some passive voice constructions like "it was committed a crime" instead of "a crime was committed".
You can often see in portuguese people's instagram bios something like "25y" or "25 years" when referring to their age
You can also hear them say "I have 20 years"
Portuguese people also say that they have a "doubt" instead of a "question"
Yeah, French speakers do the same
Same in Portuguese: actualmente
I'm starting to think it's the English that's wrong ahah
And in Portuguese : actualmente
What was your funniest "wait, you're from my country too" moment
Back in our 12th grade, we went to London during Spring Break and while we were waiting for the changing of the guard at the Buckingham Palace, some of my classmates started chanting "BENFICA
", out of boredom
To our dismay, right behind us, a group of college age students shouted back "PORTO
", we all looked at each other and burst out laughing before they went back screaming which team was the best until our teachers told us to shut the hell up
What was your funny experience with a suprise countrymen abroad
ninguém do sporting hehe enfiem no cu sportinguistas haha 5 batatas contra o benfica lmao
Didn't the accent give it away
Ahaha
It's the equivalent to senior year in high school
We have 1 to 12 grade in Portugal
Now that you mention it, I  don't see many Turks in the North region
The Macarena is played religiously on every Portuguese wedding
It's a tradition since it came out
It gets people off their chairs and dance since everyone knows the dance by heart
And also Asereje by Las Ketchup
The woman's lyrics are in English
Basically, she's hot, she can't stand her boyfriend Victorino, he was out of town and his two friends were soooo fine
You drink sangria with La Macarena, you savage
Oh, right
Sorry
I'm writing on my phone, and I didn't notice
When I dance they call me Macarena
And the boys they say que soy buena
They all want me
They can't have me
So they all come and dance beside me
Move with me
Chant with me
And if you're good, I'll take you home with me
Move with me
Chant with me
And if you're good, I'll take you home with me
Dale a tu cuerpo alegría Macarena
Que tu cuerpo es pa' darle alegría why cosa buena
Dale a tu cuerpo alegría, Macarena
Hey Macarena
Dale a tu cuerpo alegría Macarena
Que tu cuerpo es pa' darle alegría cosa buena
Dale a tu cuerpo alegría, Macarena
Hey Macarena
But don't you worry about my boyfriend
He's a boy who's name is Victorino
I don't want him
Couldn't stand him
He was no good so I
Now come on, what was I supposed to do
He was out of town and his two friends were so fine
Dale a tu cuerpo alegría Macarena
Que tu cuerpo es pa' darle alegría cosa buena
Dale a tu cuerpo alegría, Macarena
Hey Macarena
Dale a tu cuerpo alegría Macarena
Que tu cuerpo es pa' darle alegría cosa buena
Dale a tu cuerpo alegría, Macarena

I am a lot better at getting jokes in person, I  swear :)
Not so much on the internet
In Portugal there are two models:
The old one, named Bilhete de Identidade (B.I. or Identity Ticket) and the new one, named Cartão de Cidadão (C.C. ir Citizen's Card)
The B.I. is not produced since 2008, but some old people still have the this one, as people from a certain age have a B.I. without expiration date
It is as valid as the C.C. The B.I. was simply a paper card with your identification
[B.I. Sample]
The new one is more interesting
It is a plastic card, that fused four or five cards together
It not only has your identification (like the B.I.), but also has your Tax Number, Heath Number and Social Security Number (before, each one of these had it's own card)
It also has a digital feature, where one can input your address, digital signature, medical and tax info and other specific information (this is just optional, if the card owner doesn't want it, they don't do it)
That data is encrypted, so that only the people who should access it can
The card digital feature also serves as the Digital European Passport
[C.C. Sample]
[the Portuguese is this one ]
Portuguese has I'd number, contributer number and social security number, name of your parents and your height
You can have an electronic reader and do pretty much everything at home with it
This is what the old portuguese ID looked like (plastified paper)
[Here is the comparison in size
] The current one is the size of a debit card
Don't foget about the newest ID format: the APP, Portugal now has an APP where you can have your ID and driver's license so you wont have to carry any cards with you
It's called id
gov
Oh wow a sério
Nem sabia disso xD
The Portuguese one has height as well
ya é brutal, e é  completamente válida, ou seja, se um polícia te mandar parar podes mostrar pela a aplicação que ele tem de aceitar
Ahaha não há nada melhor que esfregar a razão na cara de um bófia xD
Mas é só instalar, ou tens que ir à conservatória
Podes fazer o registo pela net e depois mandam para o correio um codigo que ativa isso
Pela net precisas da chave móvel que eu tb nao tinha e podes fazê-la pelo portal das finanças
Mas vais ao site id

pt e têm lá toda a informação
Hmm, tough one
Maybe, Lisbon, Lisbon, Lisbon, Lisbon and, maybe, Lisbon
Yeah, not much variation
To get a different answer, the time frame would have to be longer, maybe all the way to 1200
When Lisbon wasn't the de facto capital
Portugal is basically the Lisbon city state due to it historically being the best port location in the Iberian peninsula so our population has always been too concentrated in the capital (nearly 30%), unfortunately imo
The Porto metropolitan area is a close second but it has never been larger
I don't think that Lisbon was ever smaller than Coimbra, the previous capital
I'd guess that the only time it wasn't the largest city of the country, was before it was conquered, but I can't back that up, it's just a hunch
It's a very very old city, moreso than most capitals in Europe
So it was probably Porto until Lisbon was conquered, and Porto became forever in second place
The only shift in the top three must have been whenever Coimbra dropped lost 3rd place to Braga
If we're accounting for the territory and not the country, then maybe Bracara Augusta was larger than Olissipo during the roman times at some point, I dunno
I began learning English at the age of 5
At the time it wasn’t that common to study the language at that age and that gave me a huge advantage when we started learning it at school
I improved it with music, books and tv shows/movies
Nowadays I feel the need to improve my vocabulary I feel that I could tweak it up a bit
I think it was around in the 5th grade, being dyslexic it was hard to understand at first and really started to hate the language because of the hard time i had (the general methods of teaching aren't good for dyslexics or just insufficient), being dyslexic has you imagine makes reading subtitles quite hard especially when you are younger but i started to focus on watching movies and tv series in English with subs and slowly stated to understand the language, gaming was a big help (play English for the PsP XP), my teacher also gave a boost in moral, by the end of 5th grade i had a good fluency in the language but some problems with grammar
Around 7/8th i had become one of the best in my class, during the summer i also started to practice speaking with tourist kids (mostly non English native speaker) and forme good friendships with them
My growth in learning the language quickly skyrocketed and only around 10th grade started to slow down from there but still improving
In Portugal we don't dub movies or series for the most part (only kids content and some channels like the History channel do it), so that helped a lot
But I personally improved immensely my fluency when I started watching movies and series with English subtitles on university
English language has a weird writing system that doesn't match phonetically, so that was my way to connect the sounds with their orthography
My written English got better when I started participating in forums and such
Youtube and Games, like every person of this generation
I started learning when I was 8 or 9 years old in school but it wasn't until I was 13 that I really started grasping the language
Classes were good because they taught me grammar and pronunciation but I feel that I really started being more fluent and building my vocabulary when I started reading manga
The English translation would be out on Wednesdays and the Portuguese one on Saturdays so I started reading in English
I started learning in the 4th grade, but it was an after-school program and very light, like how to say hello, how to count, names of colors, and that's basically it
It was in 5th grade that I started learning English in school proper
At first I wasn't very good at it
In the diagnostic test at the very start I scored a 2 out of 5, which would be a failing grade if it counted
In the first real test my grade was Sufficient, or a 3 out of 5
In the second test my grade was Good, a 4 out of 5, and from then on in most of my tests I would be among the top of the class
Aside from school, I learned English from movies, TV shows, videogames, and later on from the Internet
All in all, it came very naturally in school, because of exposure to the English language outside of school
I wish I could say the same for French, but the best I could manage in the 3 years of French we had was answering questions about a text by copying the words from the answer and the text and filling in with words written in Portuguese because I didn't know how to write them in French
I did Erasmus in Lodz, Poland
It was either that or Warsaw, but due to certain subjects I preferred to go to Lodz
It is a... strange city
Manufaktura shopping and Piotrkowska street are great, but the city in general seems to be under construction all the time
I think there are no "strange" erasmus destinations
Each person has their on goal or reason to do Erasmus
While some want to party, others want to be in touch with poorer, more humble people
Myself, I wanted to experience living solo in a civilized place with a lower cost of living than where I'm from
I know an English guy who went to LMU Munich to study English Studies
Epic
My school was shit and the others had great schools, so
I really enjoyed having those students in my school from diferent countries, my favourite was a turkish kid, and my friend who had him in his house, invited me to go watch Endgame for the 2nd time with him, his mom and the turkish kid and it was great
The town I studied in
If you don't know Portuguese you're pretty much screwed
Very chill and relaxing, as well as cheap, but also a little boring
If you're not very social and don't get involved in uni activities it'll get boring for you fast
Oh I actually know one of these
I spent my Erasmus year at UCL in Louvain-la-Neuve, and while there I met this Flemish Erasmus student coming from KUL, in Leuven
Leuven to LLN is a full 30km apart
They're also originally the same university
Amazing stuff
I know someone who lived in Porto, Portugal and made Erasmus in Vigo, Spain, it is a 1h30min drive north on the atlantic coast
It's just weird
I did erasmus in Poland in the winter and it was great
In the city I was in I only got one day of snow which was great for the experience, it never rained which was awesome since rain in portugal is a pain in the ass every day of the winter months and the cold was totally tolerable
Maybe I was lucky, but I wouldn't change it for the world
Imagine going abroad to Badajoz as a Portuguese student, lol
Someone is living my dream
Odd choice of location, lol
That's even worse
Who goes to England to learn French, lol
I don't know about his grades, but he enjoyed partying quite often rather than studying (as most Erasmus students)
Can confirm
Many portuguese people choose Poland as their first choice because they find the country cheap and interesting, myself included
I even tried to learn polish but yeah
it's hard af
And hates French
Mcann I have some baguette please Monsieur
I can only identify things like Latin, Germanic, Slavic, Nordic, etc
And even then it's not fail proof
I'm more at ease identifying Iberians
We look the same, but there's a very clear distinction in temperament, and one of us tends to travel in large groups
Also the height and the amount of make-up tend to help destinguishing Spanish from Portuguese
General rule: if it looks Latin, somewhat stoic and quiet, and it's around 1,70m, it's very likely Portuguese
Not really
It's hard to distinguish my own nationality sometimes, some spanish and italians can look very similar to us
Yes and no
I used to work Summer jobs dealing with a lot of international customers, and after a while you can kind of guess where they come from based on a lot of factors
I'm not full proof at this and have definitely been wrong more than once
The thing is Portuguese people can look pretty different
Portuguese is not an ethnicity,,you do not spot it by eye color or facial structure
That being said, in Portugal, usually yes
Outside Portugal it is far more difficult because you assume everybody is foreigner . But there is this kind of facial language, the way people’s faces move, a certain expression about the eyes that can make you feel closer
I am pretty good at telling before they speak African descent portuguese people from non Portuguese African people
The facial expressions, the reactions, hair styles , even maybe facial symmetry and if the eyes are right or relaxed are different
If they speak then you know for sure, but you can usually tell a lot by clothes, body language and facial expressions
Facial language is different, closer, it just is
That happened to me in Switzerland
I was wrecking my brains trying to remember how do you ask for an express coffee in French
The lady behind the counter was Portuguese like me but I didn't know
I ended up asking for "un petit café", the lady almost died laughing
She did
She talked to me in Portuguese and gave me a decent coffee, bica as we say in Lisboa
[I send here an Instagram page that is dedicated to some portuguese expressions (with translation to english)]
Oh god so many, idk if others have it but here we have one that translates to “if you don’t have a dog hunt with a cat”
So many
These make absolutely no sense when translated, but I'll try my best to explain:
* **Tirar o cavalinho da chuva** (take your horse out of the rain) **-** it's never going to happen, you can give up;
* **Nascer com o rabo virado para a lua** (to be born with your ass turned to the moon) - to be very lucky, constantly, throughout life;
* **Vai pentear macacos** (go comb some monkeys) - leave me alone, go away;
* **Engolir sapos** (swallow frogs) - when you hear something you don't like, but keep your mouth shut instead of replying and starting an argument;
* **Pensar na morte da bezerra** (to think of the cow's death) - when someone is constantly dwelling over things that don't matter anymore / can't do anything to change;
* **Tás aqui, tás ali** (you are here, you are there) - you're going to get your ass kicked if you don't get out of my face;
* **Pulga atrás da orelha** (to have a flea behind your ear) **-** when you suspect something;
* **Acordar com os pés de fora** (to wake up with your feet outside the bed covers) - to be in a bad mood;
* **Pão pão, queijo queijo** (bread bread, cheese cheese) - to be very straightforward, pragmatic, realist;
* **Fazer de vela** (to be a candle) - the equivalent to being the third wheel;
* **Com uma perna às costas** (with a leg behind your back) **-** when something is very easy, you could do it with a leg behind your back;
* **Cu de judas** (Judas' ass) **-** a place that is very far away;
Desenmerda-te
Unshit yourself
It's the literal translation and it means to get your shit together, a bit of an oxymoron
In Portugal we say "Don't make a storm in a glass of water" :)
In Portugal, the equivalent is to not 'make a storm in a glass of water'
In Portugal we have the Class of Letters of the Academy of Sciences of Lisbon
The Academy of Sciences of Lisbon has two classes:
The Class of Sciences has the objective of standardising exact sciences and scientific language in portuguese, in accordance to the international nomenclatures
It also has the objective of encouraging scientific research
The Class of Letters has many objectives, one of them being stabilizing and regulating the portuguese language in Portugal (the class of letters also deals with other matters regarding human and economic sciences)
The Academy was founded in 1779, by a politician, a philosopher (who was also a linguist) and a natural scientist, and was adopted by Queen Maria I in 1783 as the official portuguese institute for standardisation
It's headquarters have one of the most beautiful libraries I have ever seen
I think the reason a lot of people assume Belgium is French-speaking only is due to Franco-Belgian comic book series like Tintin and fictional characters like Hercule Poirot which are French speaking
What did he think you speak
Austrian
That probably only happens in USA
Rodrigo leão os pretty neat and underrated even here in Portugal
"10 000 anos depois entre Vénus e Marte" prog rock album by José Cid
António Zambujo and Miguel Araújo are two portuguese singers that are quite famous here and are making success due to their different and innovative songs
The first one sings fado and the second is more of a rock and roll Singer and they perform together sometimes
I'm leaving here two live performances of each one
[Miguel Araújo - Talvez se eu dançasse (live in Porto new year's eve)]
[António Zambujo - Zorro]
Gente da minha terra by Marisa
Its a really good example of the Portuguese music style Fado, that was created by wife, mothers and sisters of Portuguese discovery man during the discoveries
Dunas by GNR & Esse olhar que era só teu by Dead Combo - > From Portugal
Basically, in Portugal, we are having a lot of different things going on
Some have referred Rodrigo Leão, which is quite alternative and well appreciated by some music niche lovers
Others refered Miguel Araújo and António Zambujo, who have been playing and mixing pop, rock, bossa nova and fado in some really catchy addictive songs
But we also have some artists, specially from Angola and Cabo-Verde (or with roots there) doing some really nice music
Madonna love these, I love these and everybody who grew up in Lisbon and Porto suburbs love these sounds mixed between our cultures
Artists like Sara Tavares, Buraka Som Sistema, Branko, Dino Santiago, Lura, Mayra Andrade, Nelson Freitas, C4Pedro have been doing some really nice tunes and conquering the tops here in Portugal
Cool guys
I found them on Spotify a few weeks ago
I kinda like a few songs from Die Prinzen
they have some nice songs
I don't listen much António Zambujo but is it really Fado
For what I listened from him I would guess he is more 'pop' than fado
Acho que a música dele é mais uma mistura entre pop, fado e bossa nova
I mean I don't know really what distinguishes Fado and everything else but it's not much different from Mariza, Ana Moura, Carminho or other fado singers nowadays
Fado doesn't have to be a sad song
this is what we call Fado Canção aka Fado song
However, when it comes to Antonio Zambujo I think we could call it Fado Fusão aka Fado Fusion because he mixes other styles with the basic Fado structure, specially MPB and Bossa Nova
Lisbon vs Porto, no doubt
One represents the south, the other represents the north
There's the rivalry in football with Sporting CP vs SL Benfica (Lisbon based clubs and rivals) vs FC Porto (Porto based club)
There's also rivalry regarding food (Francesinha is the best dish, some may say)
You also have a known rivalry between Guimarães and Braga, mostly due to football
In fact, most cities "rivalries" here are *in a way* due to football
Edit: some words and check u/laserblast28 reply
What about Portsmouth and Southampton
I've heard about Portsmouth workers going on strike and Southampton ones using the opportunity to take their jobs a hundred years back
Lisboa and Porto
Basically because of all reasons imaginable (except religion)
The capital city vs the second biggest city, also representing the north
But in the end of the day we're all portuguese
Perugia - Terni
You still find road signs with "merda" written under the opposing city's name, depending where in Umbria one is
Evora - Beja
In Evora, when you want to offend someone you say that he must be from Beja
It has nothing to do with football, it probably has to do with local economical dynamics
Yes
Common accents are African, French and German
I can't come up with specific examples, I haven't seen cartoons for a long time now
But King Julien from Madagascar has an African accent; in general, African accents belong to animal characters
In general "foreign"  human characters have a French accent, English if they are silly and German if they're the villain or a silly villain
But this is just the subconscious idea I've ingrained in my head, from my childhood
EDIT: This is sort of rare, because we usually don't dub movies/series
So it's likely I've these memories/ideas from the English (or any other language) version of cartoons
Yes they dub them with Portuguese accents
Sometimes can be racist to be honest
Like the one that comes to mind is Shrek where he has a thick northern accent
The stereotype is that northern people are wildings and dumb lol
(I'm a northener)
As far as i'm aware all animated movies and series are dubbed here in Portugal
It's the non-animated ones that usually aren't.
Noticed on the other day the werewolves from Transylvania got the accent from Alentejo region
Never watched those movies in english (just watched a couple times with my kid), but I guess they have a redneck'ish accent in the original
It kind of makes sense, being also an accent from the deep, country side
Another example for that African accent you mention is that crab from the Little Mermaid
You're younger than me then
Cartoon Network used to be entirely in English and Canal Panda was big part in Spanish, English, Japanese with subtitles
There used to be some dubbing in Brazilian Portuguese, for example, all the Disney Movies prior to the Lion King were in PT-BR
Then it gradually became more common
I'm 25 btw
We haven't started dubbing movies until fairly recently
Disney and Pixar movies (Starting with Lion King) were the first cartoons to be dubbed, I think
Before that, we mostly had subtitles
I remember growing up there where 2 cartoon channels
One of them was in English without any subtitles
We only started consistently dubbing cartoons maybe 10 years ago, or less
Movies/series are almost never dubbed
But Portuguese dubbing, when it's done, it's actually really cool and well done
The actors really pour their souls into it
DragonBall dubbings are a national treasure
Rick and Morty Netflix subtitles makes the experience 2x better
Oh yeah i remember those times too
It just seemed like you were saying that that's still the reality today
Actually when it comes to animated movies and kids movies (not necessarily animated) have always been dubbed IIRC
Disney classics from the 30s are already dubbed
If I had to guess, they probably started with that after '74 revolution, but for sure didn't start with lion king
But yeah, great work, and also usually with great, known actors
At least when it comes to the most recent ones from the past decade or so
(And yes, national treasure for sure
Bubu quer bolinho
In Portugal, we have some dialects in the region of Alentejo, in Algarve, in the North (like Porto) and in the Azores and Madeira island, altough the Azores have many dialects (almost one per island)
And also one in Setúbal
There's also a secondary language in Miranda, in the North, called Mirandês
yep, we do a LOT
Wait, in what world are Nordics strict with alcohol
For some bizarre reason, Portugal usually gets away with or are forgotten whenever a discussion about slavery and colonization comes up
Everyone tosses the blame amongst the Spanish, the English and even the Dutch, but the Portuguese usually get a pass, for some reason
Not that I - as Portuguese - am complaining, but it *is* weird
To be fair, no one talks about the [Arab slave trade] that preceded it either or the slaves that the Ottoman Empire captured from Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Ireland between the 16th and 19th centuries
There was a time when it was almost impossible to live in the Algarve because of the Barbary corsairs
I'm not defending or condoning the atrocities committed by the Portuguese during the Atlantic Slave Trade, just that everyone who was involved should be held accountable, not just one particular group or race
I've seen people claim that slavery was invented by the Romans because they saw Gladiator
From 7th to 9th grade I had ceramics/pottery classes
In my opinion it was just a huge waste of time since our school barely had adequate conditions for those classes anyway, and half of the time we just ended up drawing or something like that
And I still remember when our teacher tried to punish our entire class (for bad behavior of some people) with a written test
about pottery
Yeah
That time would be better spent elsewhere
P.S. We also have religion classes in Portugal, but they are optional subjects
If I am to take your post literally then the 5th and 6th grade subject of História e Georgrafia de Portugal, History and Geography of Portugal
pretty self explainatory
I've always wondered if others countries have a subject wholly dedicated to Descriptive Geometry
It's a two-year subject that Arts and Sciences students can do
I used to suck at it in the beginning, but thanks to a great teacher I met I finally managed to understand that it's all about knowing how different objects operate in a three-dimensional space and how to depict that in two-dimensions
It can seem tricky at first, but I still think it's the easiest subject to get a perfect grade because it's an exact science
One of my most humbling experiences was getting into an Architecture course and realizing that everyone in my class had gotten a perfect score in the Descriptive Geometry exam
We also have it in the visual arts "course" in high school (it's one of the paths you can choose from 10-12th grade, alongside humanities, science, etc); história da arte (history of art), desenho (drawing) and geometria descritiva (descriptive geometry) are all classes (mandatory, I believe) in that path
We also have mandatory Philosophy classes on High School (10th and 11th year) if you follow the traditional high school
In Portugal we also have 2 years of mandatory Philosophy classes
After those 2 years, there is an option to make the final national exam of that subject, which several people do in order to replace other exam they don't want to do like Biology or something like that
> "Interdisciplinary Proyect"
We had something like this, when I was growing up, it was called «Área de projecto». Afaik it doesn't exist anymore as of 2011 or so
The class would gather in groups and each group would make a project for each trimester (or for the whole year)
Projects could range from written papers; models/maquettes; theater plays; organizing volunteering activities in the municipality and/or school; etc
> "Education for the citizens"
We also had this, when I was growing up, it was called «Formação Cívica». I believe the name was changed nowadays, but there seems to be an equivalent subject nowadays still
We had those subjects several grades in a row, but I don't remember which ones
There was also «Estudo Acompanhado», something like "Study Hall", which was supposed to teach students studying methods, but was mostly used by teachers to cover materials they didn't manage to cover during their regular classes, at least in my experience
*Formação Cívica* and *Estudo Acompanhado* always blended together in my experience, probably because we had the same teacher for both and we'd have one class right after the other
There is a border village called Rio de Onor
But it has been split for many centuries, probably since 1298, which set the border at the river or creek which splits the village in two
Actually it split into two between Portugal and Léon, but Léon no longer exists as a country of course
They used to speak leonese there anyway
Not on the national border  (though there are cities who are very close to one another and in permanent contact, like Elvas and Badajoz), but there's some examples on the municipality level
For example, there's a little town (partly) in my municipality, Vale do Poço (literally, Well Valley) that is divided between the municipality of Mértola and that of Serpa, to the point that some houses (and the church, I think) are partly in one municipality, partly in another
Vila do Conde and Póvoa de Varzim  were once clearly separated, but they both grew enough that you don't notice the border between them
that's just a single city that doesn't get legally reclassified as such, not much different from the suburbs around Porto and Lisbon
it's not on the border with another country and doesn't answer what op asked
I misread the question
The Battle of Alcacér Quibir is one of those experiences
For Portugal its the moment of a national disaster, with our young foolish King dying with only his elderly uncle, that was also a Cardinal, as the heir and that will be the cause for the Iberian Union
Meanwhile in Morocco, according to my Professor of History of the Portuguese Empire, the battle is seen as a grand moment of national pride in which they absolutely crushed the Christian invaders that had been attacking them for almost two centuries
Oh yeah lots
Particularly indians, indians are very into nationalism, and ocasionally drop in to talk of the evils of Vasco da Gama and such or the "liberation" of Goa
> in Europe I suppose he is probably more seen as a warmonger with an inflated ego
Fucking invaded us three times, we were right here in our corner not interfering with anybody
Many years of war, and caused problems for decades afterward
Fucking asshole, rot in hell
> not interfering with anybody
I mean, we were interfering with his plan to blockade England, so
Yes
I think I actually own more home clothes than outdoor clothes
My body hasn't changed much since adolescence so I definitely wear clothes I used to wear back then as home clothes
I have clothes that I only wear at home *because they are too nice to wear out*. The public does not deserve my nicest clobber and I'm not about to risk it out there on the street
ANGOLA É NOSSA
Ours used to end with "Against the Brits we march, we march
We ended up changing Brits for cannons
Crusader kings:
Tried Portugal
err its predecessor
failed miserably, I just don't have what it takes to beat the Ummayaad blob
shame on me, so I usually go viking or somewhere around Europe and the Arab world, as they're the ones I'm more accustomed to and at least know the minnimal history about
Eu4:
Portugal caralho, the only strategy game other than civ that Portugal is an actual strong start
So yeah usually I play colonisers (including conquering Portugal as Spain
sorry ancestors) or some easy countries like Muscovy and Ottomans since I'm not that great
Victoria:
Only had the minnimal experience with the game, done US, Brazil and Portugal games
never really got to the ~~end~~midgame
Hoi4:
I suck at it, so Germany and Portugal once
only to be stuck in a civil war
Yeah I tend to go Portugal in historical strategy games when it isn't just impossible for me, biased gamer
Portugal in every single one
Also Vikings and Byzantium in CK2, Brandenburg and Byzantium in EU4, Prussia in Vic 2, and Greece in HoI4
Portugal, Portugal, Portugal, Portugal
I see a trend going on
Portugal caralho
This is OOC but I've always loved this relationship of us that ressembles siblings
We may tease and poke each other, but we'd never let another country trash talk our brother
Excluding the towns named "Saint something of somewhere", "new town of somewhere" and small 10 people villages, the longest one I can remember is "Freixo de espada à cinta", meaning "Ash-Tree with a sword at its belt". It sounds just  as ridiculous in Portuguese
Vila Real de Santo António is also a long ass name
Reguengos de Monsaraz too
And just to add salt to injury, there's a literal 500 years old ash tree with a literal, again, sword around its waste, there, take a look:
That's what I meant by omitting the "new town". That would include all the "Vila Nova"s, "Vila Franca"s and whatnot
They would still count, but I'd have to look for all of them
You're right, I didn't really read that part
Does Vila Velha de Rodão count
That video impresses me every time, the journalist nails it perfectly
I mean, all of them count, they just don't make for funny or particularly interesting names, I think
They are also harder for me to remember, because you sometimes omit them
People call it "Gaia", not "Vila Nova de Gaia".
Montemor-o-velho is also pretty neat (Great Mount, the Old), so is Venda das Raparigas (Selling of Girls)
Freixo de Espada à Cinta is still the weirdest one to me, just because it's just bizarre
Yeah it doesn't really make sense
What does "Ródão" mean tho
Happy cake day <3
Grande Roda
I don't really know
Most town names are so old and have gone through so many shifts in languages (just look all the ways "Lisboa" has been spelt from the Romans, to the Phoenicians to the Arabs and the Celts and the Barbarians
I'd say that most of the cities are named after geographical features/landmarks, or after important people
Looking through a map of Portugal over a region that you're not familiar is a great way to find words that mean nothing to you, but still somehow follow the same speech/orthographic patterns you're used to
Yeah that's cool
I think I'll go back to Lisbon (living in the UK rn) to help to restaurants and cafes that had to close down yk then somewhere in Italy (mb a less obvious city with less tourists which is prolly gonna have a harder time getting back up)
Florence, I've been spending my quarantine planning a perfect trip there <3
The art is amazing,  the cool Bridges and food
It just amazes me
Just the best city in the world ngl (totally non-biased comment)
Plovdiv is sooo beautiful
If you want to visit all the museums prepare in advance or you’ll spend most of your time waiting in line
Italy is amazing, I felt 100% at home there
I feel like Italians have a very similar culture to ours, when it comes to enjoying nice food, drinking some wine, taking your time to enjoy simple things like the nice weather and the company of your friends and family
I would recommend getting a car and visiting Castelluccio di Norcia, easily the most beautiful place I’ve ever seen in my life
>tend to stay in the way,
What do you mean with that
Thanks for the advice,  I will take it in consideration and update my travel plan
Yes that happens regularly, we still have that habbit
Same in portugal Unfortunately
even now it was approved that this year there was no money to fight the traffic in influence and large capitals
and released a president who was arrested for stealing
I have a qatari car and a chinese car in my building's garage
I saw some american license plates around here, one of them from California
Also some from the UAE and Bahrain
There also some Russian license plates around here even though they are very far from here
Japanese in Algarve and american in Porto
The american SUV made me wonder why though
Dumb question but what about the car
Arroba it hasn't a translation
Arrobas was an old Portuguese weight unit that was worth about 15 kg
Same in Portuguese
Also, @ is the symbol for that unit
And it's still used nowadays with that purpose, in agriculture, mainly in the cork industry - 1 @ = 15 kg
I'd rather die than cheer for Spain
Normally if Brazil is playing against another county portuguese people cheer for Brazil
If Portugal gets knocked out, I cheer for Germany, then Scotland, then either Ireland, and then I follow the good ol' European tradition of cheering for whoever is playing against England
Wouldn't say I cheer for them, but I like to see Japan, Australia and Korea doing well in the WC
Also small countries in general
Costa Rica in the 2014 WC for example
Spain, France, Italy, Germany, Brazil, England and Argentina can all fuck off in the Euro/WC as far as I'm concerned
Well, actually, Italy and Argentina are  the ones I have the less problems with so I don't mind much if they do well
The rest nah
China
What sports
They played in like one World Cup
That's weird
Portuguese people don't root for Spain or France ever
Italy is alright with us though
Big countries are evil and small countries are good
You're a big country so you're part of the axis of evil while someone like Czech Republic or Belgium are part of the good guys
That's how it is
You don't love us though
You don't care about us in fact
So I dunno who you're trying to fool
Ah, yes, the Mediterranean Sea
That's exactly what I'm looking at outside my window
Cold, massive waves and currents, insane tides and New York on the other side
In Austria: how early they have dinner
I'm used to dine somewhere between 8pm and 9pm
Walking around Vienna at those hours, looking for a restaurant and seeing the streets basically empty and bars filled with people just having a beer or something was weird to me
I remember partying on Halloween in Edinburgh and was shocked that the clubs closed at 4 am
Granted it wasn't a public holiday the day after as they moved those all to the Monday after I believe
Agreed on the cocaine thing
Studied for a year in Edinburgh and by the second week did some at a party
I got the feeling doing cocaine was super casual over there, whereas in Portugal it's seen as more of a hard drug
At least people were friendly enough to share some
You put water in your coffee
You see, this is why you're the black sheep of the Latin family
I can't speak for Italians, but in Portugal we do perceive American coffee as an aberration
In Portugal you ask for coffee and they give you an Espresso and that's it
The good thing about having roommates from Central and Northern Europe is that they have dinner early and you then get the kitchen all to yourself
Then an Italian joins in and it messes up your dinner-making schedule
>in Portugal we do perceive American coffee as an aberration
No we don't
They didn't even drink Americano (I agree it's an aberration), they drank a "café cheio". We have that here too, you just let more water pour out into an espresso cup
We also have "café curto". Most people here would consider either just a personal preference, and both are still very much an espresso
Yes, I've learned that recently
Apparently it's us Iberians that have dinner super late
I wonder if people in other countries use that to spot us
"These dudes eating this late must be Spanish/Portuguese".
It depends on the age
But if they are really young, they go to bed around that time as well
But in such cases, they also eat earlier
But note that little children are an exception
Ah, right
I always forget about you
\*you don't. I always heard the term "balde" (bucket) and "àgua deslavada" (unwashed water)
we do
you are just a pussy who goes to starbucks
I mean "add". Espressos are pressurised out of the machine, very strong and very concentrated
You have to mix the right kinds of coffee, in the right amount, at the right temperature
Too much water, and they might lose the smell, which is important
It's a big deal in Southern Europe
When it's [done right] it can be a cool idea, actually
> \*you don't.
My contribution is as valuable as yours
You can easily say expresso is the preferred way
But black coffee is far from being an aberration
You can see a lot of filter coffee machines, for example
Starbucks is actually quite decent compared to "real" American coffee (probably because of the obnoxious quantities of sugar)
When I was in New York I bought a coffee and I'm pretty sure they gave me a cup of boiling water instead
Jesus, starbucks is so bad
at least comparing to a good expresso
I think they just want the feeling of drinking something warm, why not drink tea instead
oh, no
Your coffee is shit, period
It can be culture and be shittt, I am sure you would hate hundred of things we call culture here
Also iced tea looks tasty
In one word
Andorra: Skiing
Liechtenstein: Posh name
Luxembourg: Portugal number 2
Monaco: Casino
San Marino: Valentina Monetta
Vatican City: Pope
I did to when I played airsoft
One of the best retailers until the Poles stepped in and took the market by assault
Just wait until our diaspora starts annexation on some part of Luxembourg ( insert Doofenshmitts evil laughter)
Almost 20% of the population of Luxembourg is Portuguese, being the biggest foreign community of the country
(But of course, economically speaking Luxembourg and Portugal are nothing alike
Ahahah
Queen Valentina is the best ambassador a small and otherwise unkown state like San Marino could have
Love her
Thanks
\*high five\*
Not again
That's how it all begins
eheh
There are a lot of versions of the story
And there are a lot of websites claiming different things and missing or adding details
So the most accurate I can give you is this one from wikipedia:
I am getting my car filled anyway
Gas prices are going up
Maybe that was the idea anyway
FFS America, there is no longer even a pretense at keeping up appearances
We're out
One world war was enough, thank you
Either :
A) we are going to have another proxy war in the middle West cause by America self interest and arrogance
B) ww3 depending if any major players get pull into this mess
C) one of the above answers plus America not suffering directly from conflict because they are far away and they already feel detached from the rest of the world, Europe gets directly affected be it by another refugee crisis (i have nothing against  refugees, I'm all in favour of letting them in, the only thing i don't like is the rise of the far right that uses the refugee crisis has a political manoeuvre to get votes and spread hate), more economical problems petrol going up even more (here in Portugal we already pay way to much in comparison to our salaries), family destroyed etc something that Europe and the EU will have to shoulder most of the consequences of america meddling and Russia (ei
Putin) is probably happy (weaking Europe, dividing the American people etc)
I don't really think Iran will strike back with a war, I mean they have no interest on it
They will, at max, probably strike back with terrorist attacks across western countries, mainly countries in Europe and the US
Amen to that
does not matter, if something becomes scarce, the price goes up for all other origins
And gas prices will go higher and higher, and many americans  and saudis I am sure will profit from higher gas prices and military contracts
Spain, they already have a plan and everything
Spain
OLIVENÇA É NOSSA
Spain
We have kind of a trauma, but it wouldn't happen, we're friends
So most likely the US
Spain will be on it for sure
Spain
Spain
again
Of course it would be
Either Brazil or Spain
Spain
Wouldn't be the first time
Good you're not expecting our padeira de aljubarrota
yes
it would be Morocco :)
"I, for one, welcome our new Spanish overlords
" - João da Ega
Amém
Venezuela would be the one who is most mad at us too
Keep them busy . while they're in you we're fine
Or France if they start acting napoleonic again
Again for the 4 time
In The Spanish civil war the republican have in the constitution annexe for portugues territory
Nobody expects the Portuguese invasion
We also have plan has counter attack its called Baker woman of Aljubarrota 2
0 aka a clone army of her truly a weapon to surpass metal gear
Franco did
He said he could do it in 24 hours
[Found it]
Do we get Ibiza and Palma in that deal
Who needs air forces when you have Padeira de Aljubarrota
Respect for the tapas, hermanos
****In Greenlander accent**** They're not for sale
Yeah, we've effectively been reducing their population by a lot
Help us, Britain
We'll let you expand Gibraltar
creeps
there is and you guys are using it
Chemical warfare is illegal
If you do that we will use our clones to destroy anything that stands with the exception of Galiza, Olivença and Catalunha
For the right price, maybe
Deal
The traditional one is the "tasca". Most houses for the poor people who came to work in the city factories during the XIX and early XX century had no cooking facilities
Instead, each neighborhood had one or more cheap restaurants where everyone would eat, drink and socialize
Some of them still exist
This concepts dates back to the Roman era though and is not exclusive to the industrial age
Nowadays most restaurants and cafes have a cheap lunch menu for a fix price where people who work nearby will go to eat
Tipically you get soup, a bread roll, one or two options for a main dish, dessert, drink and coffee for about 5€.
Every restaurant and café has a lunch-hour menu
(this got heard do to a certain event in 2016)
(this is just beautiful)
'Chico Fininho' by Rui Veloso
also 'Chaga' by Ornatos Violeta
Some portuguese songs:
Deolinda - Um contra o outro
Os Golpes "Vá lá senhora com Rui Pregal da Cunha"
Humanos - Quero é viver
Taxi - Cairo
Great: pretty much anything by Valete tbh but most notably "Poder" and "Fim Da Ditadura", a philosophical and a political rap (warning for the latter if ur American)
Catchy: my (non Portuguese speaking) girlfriend favourites are 1 De Abril by Plutonio and Happy Day by Deejay Telio
For me tho, Julinho Ksd has the most catchy songs ik
My favourite PT song is actually a mix of great and catchy, Meu Deus by Plutonio
Also Alles neu
Not any accent in particular, they made him use a lot of aspotrophes to mean he mumbled words
Here's an example from Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban:
«O Conselho diretivo foi informado, claro - disse Hagrid tristíssimo
- Acham qu'eu comecei p'lo fim, que devia ter deixado os hipogrifos pra mais tarde
apresentado qualquer coisa da família dos vermes
Mas eu queria qu'a primeira lição fosse boa
Foi tudo culpa minha
In the movies (1 to 3 were dubbed in EU-PT) he has quite a rural accent from, I would say, Central Portugal
I think it suited him perfectly
In the books, however, I remember he would be speaking with a lot of apostrophes indeed, in a very countryside relaxed way
I almost forgot we dubbed the first movies
I have no idea how Hagrid sounded
What accent was it
Beira Alta
Aveiro
Beira Baixa
Ribatejo
I just know the voice actor's name is António Marques but I don't know where he is from
Regarding the accent, I just feel it might be from the Centre, I can't specify which, though
(I am not from the mainland)
He rolls the soft - r, sybillates the - s and emphasises the -e at the end of the words
Portalegre
Perhaps Covilhã?
Portalegre is not Center Portugal
by what you said that seems something like Beira Alta or Beira Baixa
My bad, I was considering Center, as in opposition to Northern accents ahah but test it yourself:you can choose the dubbed version on Netflix
Everyone: we call it X
Scandinavians: What is this “cheating”?
Classic
2) applies everywhere
During the first school years (6 to 15 yo kids) usually each class have their own classrooms , so kids bring their stuff in the begining of the day and don't need to cary them around until they go home
In high school, kids (15 to 18 yo) move to different classrooms depending on their schedules, so schools have some lockers
But are shared for more than one students, who use them to put gymnbags and heavy stuff during the day, and take that stuff with them at end off the day
I my school does have lockers, but I'd say the majority doesn't use them, at least I haven't used one in two years
I've always had lockers in my school but you would only leave your books there if you wanted
Teachers pressured us to always take them home and bring them back the next day so we would study at home after school but it was just too heavy for most of the students since we had 2 books per class
yeah but you have to pay 10 euros to use them for the year and after it ends they give you the money back, never used one as i dont need to have all of my books on me either way
Yes
In basic school (years 5-9) you had to pay 5€ in the beginning of the year in case you ended up damaging your locker
If you didn't, then they would give you back the 5€ at the end of the school year
They were usually shared between 2 students
However, in secondary school (years 10-12) you actually just had to pay 5€, or 2,5€ if you had school help, and they would not pay you back
Because of that, barely anyone had them
They didn't /have/ to share like in basic, but people who had lockers ended up sharing with all their friends anyway, so sometimes you had over 5 people sharing the same locker
In my high school and in my uni we do have lockers but they’re not a lot and very few people ask for one
We didn't have lockers in my school
Everyone just dropped their bags around the corridors
Now that I think about it, it's kind of crazy things didn't get stollen
I used to move around to different classrooms a lot in years 5 through 9 (9-15 yo), we had lockers that we shared with a classmate
I remember that despite we have (shared) lockers, we leave the key in the door lock
In the end they are only unlocked cabinets
For us 10^6 is milhão and 10^12 is bilião. 10^9, the English language "billion", doesn't have its own name in Portuguese, we just say "mil milhões", i.e. "a thousand millions".
Millions is "milhões". Billions is "mil milhões" (thousand millions)
Trillions is "biliões
". Quadrilllions is "mil biliões" (thousand trillions)
In Brazil they just use "milhões", "bilhões", "trilhões" e "quadrilhões", and God do I hope that picks up here, literal French tier numbering
There's [Mary King's Close] in Edinburgh
It's like an underground city
In downtown Lisbon there are [galleries from the Roman Empire] They're considered a *cryptoporticus*, a structure built to support the cities buildings, as the soils weren't very consistent
They are usually flooded, but once a year they pump the water out, and people can sign up to visit
There's also a [XVIII century 32km network] of tunnels built to deliver drinkable water across the city
My home town, Caldas da Rainha, is known for it's thermal waters and they were the reason for the city's estabilishment
As such, what is probably the oldest thermal hospital in world was built, and with it a series of underground tunnels to take the water from the water deposits and aquifers to the hospital
[There are above ground entries with stairs to the tunnels] but they're not advisable to explore if you're claustrophobic
These are the ones I know about
There's probably more around the country
Yes
Hey were left by the Romans and are now a museum you can visit
Not really a catacomb like in Paris, but in Porto there is a highly complex system of tunnels bellow the older parts of the city
Only a few parts are visitable (with proper permission), and those are mostly modern (ie
less than 200 years old)
The majority of the tunnel network is either inaccessible, unmapped or dangerous
We have underground streams and water canals, sewage systems dating back to roman times, and even a small river that has been completely covered for centuries
There is also an old closed railway tunnel that crosses through a big chunk of the city, several tunnels with military purposes made in the XVIII and XIX centuries and plenty of tunnels spanning through seemingly random points of the city, built to connect long gone industries and other points of interest that are no longer there
During my engineering studies I met several people who were involved in building our subway system and they talked about how they had to deal with unexpected tunnels quite often and add new drainage solutions because of it
Number of codfish recipes per capita
Portuguese is the only language in Europe that has ã õ and the sound of ão (if I'm not mistaken)
Adventuring the seven seas is our blood, we eat a lot of fish dishes even almost rivaling Japan on fish eaten, we eat a lot and i mean lot of fish, we gave the Japanese tempura (its a Portuguese dish that Japanese adapted, we still eat it)
We have one of the best drug policy in Europe and the world, and plus its unique at the time it was made, being the first country to discriminalise the consumption of all drugs
We are that western most part in Europe, Lisbon is one of oldest cities in Europe and survive catastrophic destruction (just search Lisbon earthquake 1755, which was a massive earthquake plus a massive fire and a tsunami), the tenplare order survived here in Portugal (tldr when the church started kill, and take away the property of the tenplare order, the King of Portugal decided to protect them, so he created a new order and the old members plus property and symbol were transferred to that new order, it became the order of christ; btw the head of state is granted the title of grand master of the order, BTW is heavily associated with Portugal is the symbol of the order
In the southern part Portugal we have an Arabe style of buildings and houses
We have word called "saudades" it translation is missing (has in some place or someone) but the word it self has context behind it, an emotional meaning that's impossible to translate 1:1 with any other word, the emotional context that this word has is a very strong feelings of depression sadness melancholy the feelings that you are going crazy a endless lounging of home or someone (its hard to explain it)
We have one of biggest eez in Europe
We had a peaceful revolution that ended a fascist regime in 1974 April 25th
We have a music style called fado, it's really beautiful and unique, (search on YouTube for Amália Rodrigues, give a listen for a few songs you may like it)
We had a poete that had 70ish multiple personalities, he had 3 main one and one who was a semi personality (has he described it) they were heteronyms and wrote in different styles etc (search Fernando Pessoa, it's going to be a fun trip down the rabbit hole of learning about him)
We love Cork wood, we make a lot of things with Cork, we are the biggest producers of Cork wood in the world, most bottles corks in circulation are Portuguese, we have Cork shoes, Cork wallets etc
We are also one of if not the biggest producers of paper in the world (if I'm not mistaken)
Port wine, Pastéis de nata and cork
Its shaped like a rectangle
Wine and forest
And a big fucking diference betwen coastal cities (mainly Lisbon, Porto, and probaly Algarve) and the rest of the country
Its depressing how expensive things are there
The sea
Algarve
Tourism
Thats one way to look at it
Hey, that's our thing too
Wait what
3 presidents
Is that a normal constitucional situation or abnormal one
That seems a little weird, no offence, i don't much about you guy, could you please explain the situation with that I'm a bit curious to know how and why, also sorry if this is to many questions
West*
Uhh thanks for the explanation
That's kind of unique and interesting case, is divide cause by ethnic or religious reasons or both
That's probably because of the fonectic sounds, it's like when i hear Russian, Portuguese and Russian don't share anything with each other has languages, they are separated geographically pretty far and yet they use some phonetic sound similar to some of the ones we use
It's really strange but if I'm not paying attention it sounds like Portuguese has long i don't listen to the words
Granted i only heard Russian on videos online but still
Why not try to higher the standard in education and in social interventions, you know the better a population is educated normally the less prejudice they might have towards others
And then possibly in the future make the political tension go down and maybe adopt a new political form
Sad to hear, hope the situation get better in the future
No, at least not in Porto
I also remember when I came back to Portugal from living a few months in Belgium I had to unteach myself to greet the driver when I went in
We also leave the bus through the back door, so it wouldn't work
Not in London but in Colchester it seem to be so
I have a friend who always says good morning/afternoon to the bus driver and they say the same back to her
It's uncommon, but there's nothing wrong with that
Yeah but it doesn't feel as normal, we do it less
I just felt drivers weren't expecting it
I like Portugal's, especially because it makes it look like Spain's missing something
France also has a nice shape
Square country
Australia
It kind of looks like a dolphin
Portugal looks like a face in profile
We look like a chicken nugget sooooo yeah we win
No love for square Portuguese boys
It’s a rectangle
We do have peninsulas
Check península de setúbal
And we have islands too: archipelagos of madeira and azores
We also have lots of ocean for ourselves
Turkey should be expelled from NATO and never get a chance of joining the EU
Portugal should have a firm stance against this
But that would be against the ages old strategy of Portuguese diplomacy: Keep as quiet as possible and then join the side that already won
You mean this mission  ?
Because they are clearly talking about the Patriot anti missile battery
That doesn't actively help anyone kill anyone
That strategy came when the republic was formed
The accent
When I was in London or usa the accents are literally like the ones in the movies while non natives are just like mine hahaha but something you fail ofc
You can definitely tell, mostly due to the accent
I can even tell almost immediately when someone is portuguese only by listening to their english accent
As most everyone is telling you, yes, it is easy to tell native speakers from non-native
That reminds me of a funny thing
Some years ago it was news here in Portugal that the British intelligence services discovered that a Portuguese man joined ISIS and was in Syria or Iraq (I don't remember which)
Then a clip was shown of him wearing a mask to cover his face and saying something in English
It was funny to me because it was immediately obvious that he was Portuguese, the thick tuga accent was unmistakable
Some nordics have a very good english accent but there's always something there that makes you pick up on in
Mostly I can identify native speakers yeah
In Portugal we can, specially when they try pronouncing -lhe, -ão, -ãe, and other types of uncommon sounds
Same I love to try to figure out from where in Europe people are from based on their accent while speaking english
the letter J is read like "ee" on several Germanic and Slavic languages
"Y" is read sometimes as "ai", I said "ee" as it's less confusing
In Portugal you actually hit the boot (bate a bota)
Kinda similar to the english "kick the bucket".
We also have "esticar o pernil" (stretch the leg
in my opinion we have a few:
1)pastry -
our nuns created several pastry recipes that are just delicious
The basics are always the same: eggs, sugar and flour, but the result of it's always divine
2)1001 recipes for dried codfish -
from raw to roasted codfish each and everyone has a different way of cooking codfish
and all of them are pretty amazing
3)cultural influences from our colonies -
its undeniable that we had colonies until 1970s. But even today we still have a somewhat close relationship with them
And that can be seen in fashion, music and food, of course
A true Portuguese watches Brazilian soap operas, dance African kizomba and is still discovering these amazing food flavors
4)bad TV -
due to lack of investment in good quality shows, our TV programing kinda sucks
We have one or two good TV shows but those  usually are adaptations from other European countries, specially adaptations from Spain
5) football is a religion -
and Cristiano Ronaldo is god
We are the best ones cooking cod (bacalhau) in the World
We have lots of ways of making cod and all of them are delicious
Wtf i thought my family was the only one with such mealtimes lmao
Hello fellow member of the poetry club
I believe numbers were counted that way in English in the past
Of course I'm just basing this off of the prose in A Song of Ice and Fire, which is meant to be a little archaic
For instance, there's a phrase often repeated in the books which is "I am looking for a maid of three-and-ten
for us it's the German team
we all have a kriptonite
we don't do siesta anymore
Well, the pride we have in our cod recipes is rather unique then
There are like 1001 recipes of cod fish here
Not subjective
Portugal is not the biggest producer of cod fish since we import it, but we are the biggest consumers (both per capita and by volume if I'm not mistaken)
I know that we are the largest producers of cork in the World, but that is the kind of thing we know from primary school
And I know most of the cod we cook comes from either norway or iceland
But the pride we have on our cod dishes is much bigger
And still trust me, no one cooks cod like us
It might seem subjective until you come here and prove it
"A football game is eleven vs eleven, and in the end Germany wins
O futebol è onze contra onze, e no fim ganha a Alemanha
There is a book named "1000 Receitas de Bacalhau" (1000 Codfish Recipes) that literally has 1000 different recipes of codfish
It is published by Girassol
I just checked it and here in Portugal it is selling for around 15€.
Besides that, many portuguese cooking sites have a catalogue of free recipes (although not having 1000 recipes)
Some of these are teleculinaria
pt and tudoreceitas
com
pingodoce
pt is the site of a supermarket, but they also have some pretty cool recipes
I honestly don't know if you can find them in English, but translating should give you decent results, and if you want you can ask me for help
Just search "receita bacalhau" and it should give you more options than you can try in a lifetime (websites that end in .br are Brasilian ones and I honestly don't know if they cook cod like Portugal or not)
If you want a national favorite one search “bacalhau com natas” it is sooo delicious
It really is
You should definitely try it :)
Let me just state that I don't really listen to Portuguese music
But apart from the pop songs that blow up, last for 2 weeks and disappear without a trace, Portugal has quite the big jazz scene
Without knowing too much, I'd say [Tiago Bettencourt] because everyone seems to talk a lot about him and he is always recommended on YouTube in "popular in Portugal". Also pretty much anything the [siblings Sobral] (from the Eurovision song contest) do seems to blow up
Maybe someone else can add more things to this comment
Although we do have some jazz scene the top 50 songs are all either Rap or Pop songs right now
Not counting the 40 Brazilian songs on top 50 which are still sung in Portuguese but are not made in Portugal
Amadora, it is our Detroit
Olivença. It's Portuguese but somehow under Spanish rule
Hahahah
Passa a carteira comparça
What's weird about it
Caralho vou fugir
Ah Skane the the Californiaof Sweden, but in this case instead of sawing it off and pushing it towards the sea they just push it towards Denmark by themselves
Wish you luck boys
now mind you, this is not a caricature
[Agostinho Figueira, Madeira Legend]
[Secret Story stars here] also attempt to launch a singing career after the show
"Ven a bailar", she says as she's making weird moves with her body in front of a green screen
I was here thinking Maria Leal was the worst
guess I was wrong
Ahahaha
I haven't seen this for ages
Mano nem te atrevas a insultar o deus musical Zé Cabra que nos abençoou com clássicos como "Deixei tudo por ela" etc
Also leaving this gem here ️
Zé Cabra may not be a caricature but there's enough self-awareness that it's considered a joke act
Maria Leal is more dubious in that regard
Or that "stylish" dude that was a meme a couple of months ago with with the fireworks, what's his name
This is lovely
&#x200B;
Btw
I'll share my shame:  [
filled with good music
I'm not sure I get your point
Surely [this] is considered a masterpiece
There is another
Oh god I almost forgot about him  Jorge Martinez
Fucking authoritarians
30 cm walls, can't get more European with cm
It's pretty good ngl
The best thing about it is that you can easily do that Halo song meme with the anthem yk
I honestly think our anthem (Portuguese anthem) is the best, and I’m not even that patriotic it’s just it honestly sounds good and gets me hyped up, and besides that it’s easy to sing (looking at you US), but I have to admit the lyrics are pretty similar to other national anthems but I don’t look too far into that
Heróis do mar, nobre poOooOoovo
You can also use it as a battle cry
It's extremely good to sing screaming, sends shivers down my spine
I like it
I've heard some European group wanted to change it a few decades ago because it's "too belligerent", but got a resounding "NO".
Probably like 6-7

I have one too and some people have it in Portugal (primarily in the south)
I wouldn't call them "common", but we have cheese slicers here as well
Oh man, I always sort of assumed it was related to the Portuguese "palha", as in hay/straw because the food is yellow and it would be sustaining to simpler folk (like hay for donkeys) in a jokey way
Same law here
True civilizations have bidets
Since we're also talking about other languages, Spanish people (except Catalan speakers) sound like they have a lisp to all Portuguese speakers
thats adorable :)
Sure, but the English language has the 'th' sound, but I don't think of Mike Tyson every time I hear someone speaking English
The -y suffix also applies: John -> Johny; Dog -> doggy
Also the -let one, but that's less used
Compared to romance languages, English is so telegraphic
In Portuguese at least you can have a whole sentence spread across several lines, just using commas and connectors
Granted, it becomes convoluted after the seventh or eight line, but it's definitely not uncommon to see
This is true for Portuguese too
Make (fazer sexo)
But between the millions of expressions readily available, I prefer the beautifully worded *Esticar as peles à gaita* - literally "to strech the skins of the horn"
no one really says let's go and (make) fazer sexo
most of the times is dar (have/give) uma queca/foda
I think mostly just as a flower
Poppy seeds are a bit of a thing on fancy breads, but I'd say the vast majority of people haven't tried them
This doesn't happen in Portugal but I just have to say that  this is so interesting
Probably the game of "P" changing all the consonants with "P" in Portugal and probably other countries that speak portuguese, is a really known one (I don't know if any other country has it) but its like:
"O Papo Pueu a Poppa pa Pappapa po Pei pa Puppia"
This frase is from a tongue twister in portuguese
"O Rato Roeu a Rolha da Garrafa do Rei da Russia"
That translated means:
"The Rat/Mouse Chewed the Cork from the Bottle of the King of Russia"
Same in Portugal, but we call it "língua dos pês" ("P language")
You even managed to pick an example sentence that's exactly the same in Portuguese
I would change the events from 1910 to 1926, instead of the first Republic being disaster in terms of political and economic and social issues that lead to dictatorship
I would change it so that a far more united and moderate progressive republican party lead the county avoiding the political economic and social instability and having a consistent position towards the army fighting in ww1 instead of abandoning them, this way avoiding the collapsing of the first Republic/the beginning of the dictatorship
In this timeline because the first Republic didn't collapse and fascism never took over, Portugal developes economically and socially, the people have access to education and become well informed and capable, Portugal still becomes a mostly neutral party in ww2 do to needed balance that was crucial for the allies forces, in 1950/60s a reform would occur to end the Portuguese empire, do to internal and international pressure, either by freeing the colonies out right or by a form of temporary federalism that would result in the total transfer of sovereignty to elected officials of those regions, avoiding a colonial war, this would result in the end of the first Republic and beginning of the second Republic with a new constitution more modern in essence similar to the current one
More recently would be colonial war
Most of the european countries ended colonization after the 2nd WW and despite this fact, out country (our dictator) decided to start a war with colonized countries just because on his mind, "Angola is ours" (as well as the other African countries such as Mozambique or Cabo Verde)
Nah because we have a stronger and far older national identity we would sooner or later recuperated our total sovereignty and get out of the Royal union
Plus kicking Spaniard is our national past time, and the Aljubarrota Baker woman is the best at it (this last part is a joke, sorry XP )
the whole archetype of strangers and good and evil and all that, no
It is weird
This has been too densely populated for much longer to be places outside law and order
But the cowboy as an itinerant worker which herds cows on horseback,  we got campinos, who I expect might be kind of related to the ancestor of the cowboy give some centuries and an ocean in the middle
People practicing transumance  driving massive herds (of sheeo) across hundreds of thousands of kilometers  twice a year is a very very OLD thing, at least 2000 years old in these parts if not older than that but we got no records
Also I think very traditional in the alps and other parts of Europe
True for Portugal as well, although I think the Portuguese Adventurer exploring exotic lands has outclassed even the Knight
I wonder about the Spanish Conquistador
I don't want this to sound bad but, apart from the historic significance, we couldn't care less
It was not our war, we were busy selling tungsten to both sides and lending airports on small Atlantic islands
Much like many other historically significant moments in history east of Germany and Austria, like the breakup of Poland-Lithuania, the Great Northern War or like the Crimean War are glossed over in regular history classes
Most people have probably never heard of any of them
Yeah, I think fascists were a prime Iberian product, back then, much like olives and an overabundance of English expats are nowadays
The minium wages of places like Spain but still maintaining the same life expenses, Germany ability to have surpluses and the special roads without the speed limit (I'm speed
American Research and Development, capitalist mentality
Polish work ethic
Israeli chutzpah
More rain, particularly rain in summer
Really, that would be it, thanks
Swiss salaries and fondue
I was thinking about the same thing
I was going to suggest Germany and Switzerland
I mean it's good and all, but then people accuse us of being lazy, so
Plus I think the relaxed lifestyle is somewhat related to weather
If you're good at dealing with forest fires
Everyone in Portugal thinks they are Senna
According to our European neighbours we drive on the road and highways like rally drivers, to be honest they aren't wrong
Still it would be cool to see and push your car to its limits, i guess
Do you live in Portugal
Because drought and forest fires are much bigger concerns to me than raining a bit in summer
Basically Swiss salaries with Portuguese prices, but I'll guess I'll keep dreaming
I get it, taking something like a John Cooper Works Mini through Caramulo is something I would be down for
To everyone calling us lazy, I just dare them to work on 30+C° for 1/2 or even 3 months if the year
That usually does the trick
Plus, in Portugal, don't expect much air conditioner
We have way more than enough sunshine in summer so that we can spare a few for a little more rain
Everything turns green and nice smelling afterwards anyway
Being without the sun for many days in a row yes it can be depressing but it is not like you can only have opposites
I would just like the dial to a bit more rain
Also I do not know what you are like in Greece but that is very surprising
In winter we enjoy the sun, but the moment the sun turns to turn strong, we are all about walking on the shady street, parking in the shade, wear an hat, close the shutters, the sun is going to fade your curtains, your carpets, your washing
Nobody actually likes 40 degrees weather
You talk to anybody in the countryside and they talk approvingly of a "chuvinha" when it happens
You sure
I read somewhere Ireland was one country which did not have a lot of water reservoirs and had drought vulnerability
In fact I have been to gardens and parks in Ireland, you guys are on cheat mode, it is ridiculous, and whatever I looked there was no watering infrastructure
You all are cheating at gardening though
Rain is much nicer, fills reservoirs, improves environmental conditions of rivers, waters crops, washes dust, puts down fires and wets possible kindling
To each their own, I would like more rain in summer in Portugal
No, we just let the trees burn and no one correcly replant
Its sad
I wish
We can't even convince the entire population that corruption is really bad and we should take extreme measures against it much less plant trees
Not on TV but a movement started on social media and on the 22nd of September there'll be a big movement to clean the beaches, forests and all that
which causes even more fires, yes
No, eucalypts are good to make paper i think, so its a way to make money to the govern
It would be the [licor beirão] It is the most consumed liquor in Portugal at the moment
It has a sweet and aromatic taste
O que é que se bebe aqui
Either that or aguardente
The one with the best name is: licor de merda, for sure
(literally translated to: *shit liquor)*
That or Ginjinha de Óbidos
Eau de vie de poire williams is great
And I bet you can't say it right lol
Just have some Beirão, you'll get it right
Say 'sound' without the 's' or 'd' sounds
Depends
Compared to spanish
sure
As a language, per se
No, not really
I don't.
Nope, Portuguese on the other hand, is a pain in the ass
I agree that English is on the easy side
But it does have one difficulty and it's not any grammar rule, it's the large number of exceptions
I wouldn't say so, if you were like me as kid who watched all sorts of english stuff on TV and games
I'm English and live in Portugal
When I talk to my friends here about language they all say that English is easier to learn than Portuguese, but I think Portuguese has an easier structure than English because most things are *regular*. Sure there are some exceptions, but in English exceptions are the rule and every bloody verb is conjugated in a completely different way
I learned Turkish some years ago and although the vocabulary was very difficult to learn the structure of the language was a cake walk because everything was as regular as clockwork
There was no irregularity, no exceptions to the rules
With a dictionary and a basic understanding of how to conjugate and make noun cases there was nothing you couldn't communicate
I've studied both languages in uni and Spanish is definitely harder than English
The grammar is much more complex and there are a lot of false sister words
Of course it might be easier to speak to a Spanish person, but to actually talk in Spanish and not in Portunhol is very complex
The similarities between Portuguese and Spanish is what makes you struggle while learning the language
On the other hand, English is super easy
First, here in Portugal we are exposed to a lot of English (movies, music, etc)
Secondly, it is the first foreign language most of us learn
And also the grammar of the English language is so simple, is even easier than learning our own grammar
>six possible future tenses separated solely by semantics and nearly untranslatable from my native to English/vice versa
On the plus side, you only need to understand their usage, and not memorize 6 different forms of the verb for each person for each tense
I appreciate your sentiment and I do agree a bit on how people come across as arrogant - and I'm just personally about to fall into that hole - but I don't fully agree with you when it comes to differences you list
Yes, English has all those features that are tricky to learn, and some seem indeed unique to English, like phrasal verbs and the weird orthography, but all the other things
All other languages have them as well
There's slang, there's also prepositions that change whole meanings, there are words that mean different things in different dialects, a need to learn the cultural background, to understand politeness levels and different registers
every single language has those as well
You say there's more tenses in English than in German, but that becomes a moot point if then English only has a total of what, 4 different variations of each verb
(I'm thinking of "speak, speaks, spoke, spoken", for instance
Are there more ways the verb can be changed
So when people say English is easier is because on top of all those things, other languages also have other complicated features, like a vast number of cases, complicated verb conjugation, gendered words, diacritics
In my opinion, it's not just about the exposure, which I agree, is a massive factor in learning English and takes years off the learning process (and skews the view of everyone when it comes to this debate)
The inherent nature and structure of English itself makes for an easier learning curve, compared to other languages
Yup
Most portuguese can fudge some amount of functional spanish, without any kind of formal education in the language
You can't really do that for english, not to the same extent at least
Never might be a strong word but there a really strange thing that happens when fines or regulations are imposed on US companies
There are always a bunch of people seemingly angry that a government tries to limit the power of private companies and it is so fucking odd
Like, who are these people that feel the need to jump in defence of mega corps that have zero interest in anything besides maximizing profits
People not specifying which country they're talking about and assuming everyone knows which one it is
/r/MURICA
Assuming Portugal is part of Spain or that we were part of Spain that achieved independence, even though Portugal is older and more unified than Spain and we beaten in wars multiple times having a Portuguese soldier to 5 or 10 Spaniards
Or that its crazy such a small country exists being next to a larger country
Or saying some bullish about left and right wings and comparing every thing to America politics, or not understanding the meaning of the word socialist and automatically bringing one type of socialist even though the word has multiple definitions and applications in political compass and confusing social democracy with socialist or democracy with Republic or any variation of the other, associating health care with communism, hating regulations on private business
Oh and asking if in X country is weed legal, like Portugal for example, just because we don't arrest base on consumption and porting small grams of weed for self use doesn't mean its OK to bring 10kg of weed with you in Portugal
>Toilet or WC instead of bathroom
That might be one the ones that weirded me out the most recently
I had no idea that WC wasn't a global term
"Do you even have the internet
But the thing is not about having a gun, it's the cult like following that they seem to have
I grew up in a rural area and hunting rifles are really common and they are more than enough to scare someone away
No one would fashion their personality around being a a gun owner, it's a tool like a bucket or a wheel cart
We gotta worry about something on the international stage
Not insecurity, just annoyed its like the over used joke about the French waving a white flag while surrendering, it's annoying and boring the stupidity of some people
But they are racialized anyway
I couldn't find the thread (it was one of those askreddit about between diferences between Europe and the US) so here is something I found in the top search on google:
"WC (meaning 'water closet') is something that I only ever saw in Europe
It is the only one of all the ones that you mentioned that would probably confuse a person in the United States
Of those, the ones that are common around here are bathroom and restroom
Yes because they are facts and historical information that explains the context of existence of our countries my friend, you can't explain why Portugal borders are the most consistent and oldest of Europe without explaining historical facts
I mean that even if they're not part of distinct ethnic group (as Islam is made up of practically people of all colours and shapes) the concept of "Muslim" is treated as an homogenous form of a religious fundamentalist
She existed, and she did kill Spanish soldiers but not that many, that an exaggeration
Also its a fact that Portugal with a smaller army was capable to defend and defeat Spanish forces
Anyone that tells you about the Baker woman of Aljubarrota story is either telling the story or joking or baiting Spaniards to troll
Varsóvia - Warsaw is the biggest one that comes to mind
The most different ones i can remember are:
Warsaw - Varsóvia
Krakow - Cracóvia
The Hague - Haia
Beijing - Pequim
Cape Town - Cidade do Cabo
Bethlehem - Belém
Apart from these i think they're all kind of similar to the English version or at least easily recognizable
I know this is a nitpick, but the Anglosphere tends to say "Port wine" to refer to wine from Porto, but then refer to the city as Oporto
So that city has two names depending on what you're referring to, and neither one is Porto, a word that isn't even that weird in the English language
( english - portuguese);
Venice - Veneza;
Stockholm - Estocolmo;
Warsaw - Varsóvia;
(not a city but) Scotland - Escócia;
Michigan - Michigão (never seen it being used, but it shows up on wikipedia, we just say Michigan)
In Portuguese it's Florença. Interesting how the English name is more similar to Portuguese than the Italian one is
Also Beijing -> Pequim
Guangzhou - Cantão also
On reverse, the only one that is midly irritating is foreginers referring to Porto as Oporto
Also Mechelen/Malines and Derdermonde/Termonde
In Portugal I think we just use Google Maps or Waze
I wish we had something like that
I know the question it's not for me, either way, in Portugal, most of the time we just refer to UK as England  and people from UK as English
Great Britain is supposed the name of the bigger island
All 3 of those countries have little islands that aren't part of Great Britain
But this is a pedantic distinction, so I would guess everyone ignores it
1€ a beer
10€ full good meal with dessert and drink
100€ a plane ticket to the Azores :)
1€ - a kg of bananas
10€ - 16 banana flavored liquid 20cl yogurt bottles
100€ - a maximum premium one Saturday to Sunday night stay at the Parque das Nações Ibis Motel
I can confirm this
It's cheaper than in Portugal
You find that strange
Went to Turkey some 17 years ago, before they cut 6 zeros to their liras
Thought about trading some pocket money for the week and gave the guy 350 Euros
Got in exchange 420
000
000 lira, mostly in 10 and 20 million notes
Enough to say that I got all my pockets stuffed with banknotes
At that time you could  have a pretty decent lunch at the grand bazar, for around 5M.
A draft beer (20cl) in bars
The prices rise a bit in more touristic places, the medium is around 1,50€. The pints (0,50cl) cost around 4€ in touristic places, though you can get them at 3€/2,50€ in some places
Bottled beer is around 1,70€/l in stores, we have 20, 25 and 33cl bottles
The prices rise in bars, and the nicer view you have, the higher they are (as the drafted beer)
The 1l bottles are even cheaper, but they aren't sold in bars
In a Lisbon restaurant not really
1€ beer and 10€ meal on a plane still not possible
To you and u/normanbombardini here's a [site ] that compares beer prices in the biggest supermarket chains
It's updated regularly
Also, watch out for some tourist traps and ask for "cerveja" and not "beer". Sometimes the menu will state sth like *beer - 2€* and *cerveja - 1€*. They're the same but more expensive to the tourist who doesn't know what a "cerveja" is
I only learned cursive and that's what I had to use in Primary School
After that, they didn't care what we used
I eventually ended up doing a mix where I write print-like capital letters and use cursive for most lowercase letters
We're taught to write in cursive
I learned cursive in elementary, but changed to print on my own in middle school because my cursive wasn't legible and, believe it or not, I'm faster righting in print than in cursive
I don't think there is this obsession with handwriting style here in Portugal
Teachers don't really care if you use cursive or print, they just want to be able to read it comfortably
I learned cursive, but I hated it so much and had  trouble writing some letters (I even had a friend of mine drawing the  letter **E** for me) that I  taught myself how to draw printed-like letters when my dumb ass bitch  primary school teacher stopped calling me out for not writing the way  she wanted me to
Now my handwriting is computer-like, except for the  letter **a**. I must also  mention that I am and always have been terrible at arts in general, so  drawing letters in cursive was a challenge for me as a kid
Cursive exclusively untill 5th grade
After that, as long as it was readable, you could write as you wished
Same here in Portugal
There are a few pickpockets on busy streets and public transport that tourists usually take, so always keep your bags closed and in sight
Also, if you're in a bar/restaurant with outside seating area, don't leave your belongings (phones, wallets, etc) on the table
There are groups where woman casually pass by, steal your stuff and immediately give them to an accomplice
By the time you notice your stuff is gone, the woman have nothing on them and it's too late
Just don't buy any drugs from creepy dudes offering them in the streets in the center of Lisbon
They say it's good hash, but it is just dried bay leaf
Tourists, mainly first world tourists have heard something about Portuguese drug laws
Thor think drugs are yay legal
And a surprisingly amount of them are looking precisely for that
And they think nothing is strange if they are offered cannabis or cocaine for sale right on main street with plenty of people around
Suckers
I honestly had the best paella ever that lasted us for 6 meals, only for 10€, in a restaurant very near a main square
I still have no idea how we got so lucky
Granted, this was 10 years ago, might be different now
There was also that scandal a few years ago when a restaurant would give you the menu, you chooses something and they would say something like "oh we don't have that at the moment but I'd recommend *insert something that doesn't appear in the menu*". Then when you received the check it was a shit load of money
Hmmm
Portuguese here, so, I don't any issue with it
I mean Codfish is better, but Octopus, squid, cuttlefish are also quite tasty options
Take that, Cthulhu
You would not win against us, we could cook you
It is our traditional Christmas supper, for a lot of the country anyway
Americans are weird
I am going to add to the list though Hungarians which when served dishes garnished with (huge) prawns freaked out
Completely normal
Did not even occur to me that it would be a weird thing until I shocked my ukrainian in-laws
I just understand my mother in law going quietly in russian "why tf has martcapt cooked an octupus
The fuck
", or something similar
They wound up liking it though
I think they also liked the idea of coming back home with an exotic story, the same way if you ate idk a seal or something
That's beautiful
I had an aunt that did it that way
Lived food
That is a line I'm really not interested to cross
So, nope, big time Nope
Calimari is not an octopus is a squid
There are multiple british people here confusing the two I have no idea why
> hate the consistency,
It might be badly cooked
If improperly cooked it is rubbery, stretchy, nope
If it is properly cooked it is basically melt in your mouth stuff
You have to properly cook it
Then you let it go cold and make a salad with olive oil, vinegar, parsley and a small pinch of salt and pepper
If you must you can have paprika too, but I find it unnecessary
Eat it with good Alentejano bread and red wine
what's finland
Nah, I'm happy where I am
I think the US has some good things and some bad things, just like any country, but I personally don't see anything that drives me to it
If I absolutely had to move, though, I'd rather move to another European country than to the US (even though I have some family there and could easily get citizenship)
I just don't see it as the Best Country In The World as many Americans do
It's just a country and there are enough negative things about it (IMO, of course) to make it not be on the top of the list of countries I'd move to if I absolutely had to
No, there's at least 15 other countries I would choose over the US
I wouldn't really like to live in that mess of country tbh
I think that if I had move overseas I would probably choose either Canadá or Australia
No, because i live in a country with better standers of living, i have healthcare, safe, better drug policy, i have more freedom than most us citizens, access to a better and cheaper education
And better food from a taste and health perspective
I would like visiting the US but not living, fuck that, that's way too dangerous and expensive
First of all, I can't imagine living abroad
Second, I can't imagine living outside of Europe
As for the US of A in specific, I don't think I could live there, no
Too different from Europe and I doubt I'd adjust well to it
Also, I can't drive and have no desire to learn how to, so there's no way I could live in a country where you need a car to do stuff outside other than taking out the trash
I don't feel safe in a country where having firearms is allowed yet they don't have free healthcare
Portugal might be an indebted shithole right now but I wouldn't trade my free healthcare and gun control for anything
Yes i would, i like the techs there ans good universities
Interesting that you'd choose Canada but not the US
Both countries seem similar in a lot of ways (though by no means the same, before all the Canadians come at me)
I feel the same way though, I'd sooner live in most Europe, NZ, Australia, SK, Japan and Canada over the US, unless I got a great job offer there that I couldn't deny
Good points
Everyone is talking about healthcare and guns and forgetting about their military fetish and the awful imperial system
BuT wE PAy LOwEr tAxEs
I can't understand why they think like that, they still have the same mentality that they had during the American revolution for independence when it comes to someone governing the land
they don't trust the government and think its always plotting something against the American people
Great point
I just changed my mind, I'm not only going to the US, I'm also dying there yay
And Portugal is still way nicer to live in anyways, your point
... Funny someone that live in portugal saying that
Wtf
How us had a nazi/commie regime
I'm doing a parody of their arguments with "BUt We PaY LoWeR tAxEs" . But yes they spend more and have less protection in comparison
Your lack of trust is not proportional, you guys have a really radical mistrust
And the thing is, having mistrust of the government is fine, because of who is in office and their decision, but you guys turn that mistrust 10000%, hell lot of the retoric that tries to justifies having access to arms on a near military status (by civilians) is built apon that mistrust even the constitucion suggest that idea
First of all, I'm not the population of Portugal, I'm a Portuguese individual
Second, there's a different between feeling not heard and saying it and acting on that belief, a subjective belief
Third the study you are probably referring bases it's conclusions only 2 primary question (and a few other secondary questions, I'm not totally sure), and study ignores culture and historical context, 40 years ago we had fascist state that rule for 40 years and that left scares, we still have old people and even middle age people that believe that Salazar (the fascist ruler) was a good politician and he was a better ruler (the same guy that had a concentration camp for prisoners of consciousness, the same guy that didn't invest health care and that regress the country and its culture) , we have really recent Democratic and republican roots compared to most States in that study (50 countries)
In the US you have people and movements actively saying to people to buy guns base on the belief that the government is going to take their rights and make the American people slave to the government, in Portugal we don't have nothing like that
There's a different in believing and actual facts
I live in portugal
I know these things
I lived in us too, you already lived in us
Us is safer than Ukraine in homicide rate but ok
And
That has nothing to do with the argument or that study
Anwser me
You already lived in US
Or you just talking bulshitt thar you read in the internet
? But gun violence is included in homicide rate
Again this has nothing to do with the argument, i don't need to live there to know that people like that exist, hell there are people in the US that believe in Alex jones, you can ask most libertarians if they trust the government and answer is will be most likely no, they also say taxes are legalise theft by the government
I don't need to be fiscally there to know the political discore because video evidence exists of such beliefs, i don't just read news or reddit post i also see videos and follow political channels from both sides that comment on the same issues, i can i also see people commenting on twitter and other social platforms saying the same retoric and calling people to join and do x because government is bad or because person x in government is a "dirty socialist" or a "fascist" etc
Lol you are from portugal a economic failed country because of taxes and is talking about US
Yes but us is not that violent
Freedom of speech existe and at least here my taxes are use to protect the human dignity that's the sanctity of life and offering equal protection to all the people from all walks of life/economics
And Btw the economi is growing, and problems that the economy has is because of the legacy left by fascist state and the mentality of the business man culture
Wtf
Us have human rights too
Us hdi is higher than portugal (human development index)
Do you have universal health care there
death penalty exists in the US
how does that respect the sanctity of human life
it doesn't respect
Public heatl care is horrible in portugal
They have death penalty in just some states
Just see the dhi and you can see that us is better to live that portugal
thats false, Portugal health care is one of the best in the world, ranking in the top 12 health care
No it is not lol
If you are saying about stats you can see the hdi rank that show portugal at 43th while Us is in 13th
I'm a 25 year old guy and I can tell you that they talk very openly, I have heard about mine and my siblings birth, I also heard about my cousins birth and my coworkers birth, like I started this job 4 months ago and already heard about their kids births
It doesn't even have to be a woman from your close circle
It can be a colleague from work (and she will even show you the photos of the baby in her phone without you even asking while she is telling the story of the birth) or even a random woman in the street
For example, in a public transport it wouldn't be weird if an older woman started talking about her experience to a pregnant woman or a woman with a baby sitting next to her
Caldo verde - a soup made of potatoes, kale and chorizo
Any soup with kale, meat, beans
I think I’ll make some soup tomorrow
The one and only Cozido á portuguesa
You eat one plate and you'll be satisfied for a week
Not sure it it's the same, but we also have "Carolino" Rice
Sounds similar to Karolina
When I went to the Netherlands, my Dutch friend told me I HAD to try kapsalon
After seeing my disgusted face after explaining what it was, he said "just wait until you're drunk
Or high
Accurate af
Love me some kapsalon
(And kroketten
And stroopwafel
And freshly sliced gouda on a slice of bread
And chocolate sprinkles on a slice of bread
Keep me away from your country or my clothes will stop fitting
French taco is definitely my comfort food whenever I travel to France
They are so good
Similar to Portuguese's "miséria", which can also translate as squalor
In portugal, we do small changes to almost all countries names to make them more Portuguese-y. But beside that small changes there is some who are very different:
Germany ->Alemanha
Switzerland -> Suíça (the spelling is very different but it sounds similar to the first part of the word)
Netherlands -> Países Baixos or Holanda
Spain -> Espanha (which is more like the name in spanish: España, so
USA -> only Estados Unidos (United States) or only America (If we would talk about the continent it would be North America or South America, not only America
I think the most different is Germany -> Alemanha
All the others are almost the same
Portuguese fun fact: the translation of turkey is peru, which is also a name of a country
In portuguese: Germany --> Alemanha/Netherlands --> Países Baixos
portugal is portugal  on almost all languages
There's quite a few " Mastro bar" here in Portugal
While it seems innocent enough to call your bar " flagpole bar", the truth is that when you read it it sounds like "masturbar", wich means to masturbate
The company that owns Biedronka is actually Portuguese, I don't think they thought too much about it and just went with an animal's name because of żabka and another store (can't remember the name) that has a bear in it's logo
There's also stores in Poland called "od i do" and if you add an f behind it then it becomes "fucked" in Portuguese
Ok, then my theory is irrelevant
I've always known it as Portuguese, not that JM bought it afterwards
My apologies
Os Lusíadas, by Luís Vaz de Camões, written in the XVI century
It was literally written to be *the* portuguese lyrical epic, par excellence
It's widely accepted as our national equivalent to the Aeneid and it was meant to laud the deeds of the portuguese discoverers
Yes
[Os Lusíadas] The name means "The Lusiads", another form of "The Lusitanians". The book is written in the form of Homero's Odissey and it's about the adventures of many Portuguese (Lusitanians) throughout history, until the year it was written (16th century)
The main focus is the adventures of the Portuguese navigators
This author, Luís de Camões, is also kind of like out "Shakespeare". He is the symbol of the Portuguese language
EDIT: when I wrote this, there was no other Portuguese contribution on this thread
When I submitted, there were other four
I knew that this question would bring a swarm of Portuguese
This book is really important for us
The "[Os Lusiadas] A XVI century epic poem, by [Luís Vaz de Camões] telling the history of Portugal
It is "Os Lusiadas", by Luis de Camões
Him and his work was ( and still is) so important to Portuguese culture, that our national holiday (Portugal's day) is at the tenth of June because that was the day in which Luis de Camões died
"Os Lusíadas" basically, **everyone** has to study numerous parts of the book
If you dont recognise the name it's a Portuguese maritime expansion epic composition by Luís Vaz de Camões
I really want to read Faust, but I want to read it in German
I'm currently at an A2 level
Do you think it's a hard read
I would like to have the capacity to fully enjoy the experience
I have Kalevala in a pretty blue hard cover
Got that one
Both poetic and prose
Sadly, I didn't find it all that interesting
That's not from Os Lusíadas though, it's just one of his poems
You can tell it doesn't have the structure in 8 line stanzas
Sorry, I didn't pay that much attention in Portuguese classes
But it's the only thing I from him that I found translated
And I dare not translate Camões
I'll remove it
Rural-turned-suburban Portugal we have plenty of rabbits
I've also seen a few hedgehogs and even a couple of mongooses
Foxes also roam the area, but not as near as these (I've only ever seen one in a corn field nearby)
All of them keep clear of the people and their pets, though
Nah very rare to see a stray dog nowadays
Some feral cats and birds and that's it
We should pressure sponsors to threaten to pull out
It’s an actual disgrace
People have died
A less controversial source saying the same thing:
They just do not care about food, not culturally
And I am not even talking about preferring recipes of one part of the world or another, I am talking of that mind-boggling thing to a portuguese person of lunch being industrial bread with something industrial (cheese, paste, whatever) and they are perfectly happy with it day in and day in and day in
On rich countries, with a lot of access to food
And not even comparing with southern european but on many, much poorer parts of the world, people would be much more demanding of imagination
I have no idea why food is not a big deal culturally for them
Consider Japan, which might have a similar climate and lack of resources and how obsessive they are into making a lot with meager resources
There are places with a coastline in Europe where people do not even distinguish types of fish and hardly eat them, or just deep fry fillets
we had our own monopoly on spice trade at another time, and we spice use in our cuisine
Your cuisine is just, well, not trying very hard
In fact supposedly we took chillies to India and others
>I mean it's in our culture because it has been that way for centuries
yes, but my point, my wonder is why it was like that centuries ago
Other cultures similarly poor in resources or variety of foodstuffs available could do much with very little, even often in the way of ritual
It is very interesting to me how disconnected nordic or northern european (as far as I can tell russians no) culture is from food as culture, pleasure
It is not like you can only compare northern and southern europe, I am thinking of the whole wide world
I am thinking not so much north necessarily but altitude can also be a huge limiting factor
The Himalayas, the Andes
Or heck, even Russian cuisine, which seems far more imaginative
It is a good interesting reply
It is still pretty shocking though modern food culture
>Again, where exactly did you expect the culture to come from
It's a thing that takes generations to develope
you were talking of andean people adpating culture from the spanish, of russians adapting culture from further south
(though finnish do not seem to have adapted russian style food)
Food is probably the fastest spreading culture, sweet potatoes as an ingredient spread all over the globe in less than a century after its "discovery" by europeans, including to the highlands of Papua New Guinea
>we are doing pretty well nowadays, if you've never had modern Danish haute cuisine, try it
I am not concerned, I was not talking about individual examples, or exceptions or haute cuisine
Or recipes even, I was talking more and more of everyday food everybody eats and how it can be important, a big deal
It is still strange to see norwegians perfectly happy with the white bread with paste sandwich for lunch every day of the week (hope they get something better for the weekend)
Or dutch people
Sacro Império Romano-Germânico
"Sacro" means sacred and I think you can understand the rest of the name
Sacro Império Romano - Sacred Roman Empire (Portuguese)
Should have seen your comment before commenting
We say the same, but with an additional '-' and accents '''.
Usually younger people tend to mix those words into Portuguese but we tend to avoid it to preserve our culture and language
It would be really weird to see some important organ in our government to use that kid of words
Portugal: No, simply because most of our words are very similiar to their english counterparts, so you'd basically be using the same word but it wouldn't flow as nicely as the almost exact same word in portuguese
For example the words you listed:
Computer: Computador
Message: Mensagem
Elevator: Elevador
Pretty much the same word, using the other words would just come off as someone trying to look cool
(Even if there ARE words we borrow from english, one I use a lot is just putting "tho" at the end of some sentences)
Not that i'm aware off and tbh i think that would be useless because you can't force people to use certain words instead of others, it just happens naturally
What does seem to happen here is that some loanwords just naturally become portuguese words due to people changing the way they are written over the years
Some examples of this are:
football -> futebol;
leader -> líder;
champagne -> champanhe, etc
I have a problem with prepositions
I sometimes mix in and on; to and at
I was recently corrected by a client because I said I would come back _at_ her soon
Apparently that's aggressive
Prepositions
Sometimes i don't really know which one to use - in/on/at
Push and pull, in Portuguese puxar (to pull) is spelt the same way as push but means the exact opposite, making it confusing as hell
I often mix up "always" and "also" but only when speaking, it's like I want to say one of the words but I accidentally say the other one
I was reading your post and thinking "Wow, this is indeed very confusing". And then I translated to Portuguese and it's "lavar and levar", and I got self-conscious
I think it's a matter of habit
I've heard non-native Romance language speakers saying that Romance Languages go wild with verbs
You'll get the hang of it
To answer your question: probably "push", because it sounds exactly like "puxe", which means pull
If you ever come to Portugal, doors in public places usually have both Portuguese and English sticker, and you will see many, many people who can't open a door
It's not like I get them mixed up but I always have to take an extra second to think about though, through, thought, and the word push like when it's written in a door because in Portuguese pull is "puxe" and it sounds the same as push so the amount of times I had to stop read push and think it's the contrary and still pulling it is ridiculous
When I was starting to learn English I often mixed up the verbs have and there be because
"Ter" means "to have"
"Haver" means "there be"
I mix up British and American spelling all the time
Words like "colour" and "favour" I always get right, but I never know when to use an "s" or a "z" in some words, and I end up going with the latter a lot more
Hand fingers and foot fingers are also a thing in Polish and in Portuguese
Same here
In Portuguese I mean, but the word is the same
I think it's got to do with the fact that "eventually" is a really useful word, whereas the correct use of "eventualmente" is usually something you can replace with more common words with the same meaning
Tbh a lot of people misuse "lay". It's one of my pet peeves
That and not using adverbs
Not just bicycles but also vehicles where you aren't the driver
Germans often say they're driving to a place when they're taking public transport, for instance
Well, I think every language has that kind of unwritten rules
The more you use the language, the more you use those expressions right

That was unexpected and I giggled

Eusébio was kind of (and a fado singer called Amália), and Cristiano Ronaldo might be one day

Cristiano Ronaldo, specially in Madeira
The poems he wrote in Milan were amazing
Sadly, it seems his inspiration ran out when he moved to London
Not in Portugal, I haven't met a single Portuguese who believes in such things and if there is any, they keep these believes to themselves for fear of being shuned or humiliated
I've never met an antivaxxer or a flat earther in my life
I could see climate change deniers being more common but still can't think of any I've met
>antivaxx, flat-Earth, climate change deniers
No, at least has far has i know, if there are they are extremely small and most people don't even know they exist
>Is anti-intellectualism a thing in your country
In broad general terms yes, somewhat, for example politically around transgender people, the left wing parties want to create legislation that would strengthen the protection of transgenders from discrimination for going to the bathroom of the sex they identify (although technically they already had that right and protection at a Constitutional level Art 13 n2 [the n2 gives a few examples of discrimination but it's not restricted to only those, there's also in the n2 discrimination base on sex that's that's already predicted so either way no one has a right to discriminate gender identity ], Art 21 the right to disobedience and art 26 the right to develop personality, but its a good thing they wanted to create more legislation because most people aren't smart enough and it gives a more solid protection against idiots that don't understand Constitutional law and think that the n2 of art 13 are only limited to those examples
The Christian rights wing and the center right are mostly against this, and the Christian right called it "Turing the school in to the bloco de esquerda summer camp" [Bloco de esquerda is one of the most pro lgbt political parties], the other day there was a debate between 2 lawyers on TV about the rights of transgenders, one of the themes was this one about bathroom, one said it was anti Constitutional letting them go to the bathroom of the sex they identify, he didn't justify with no articles or principles he was just saying BS, the other lawyer counter argumented and call on the BS of the other lawyer
I don't think so
We started hating the Germans after 90% of our young male population died in WW1, but 20 years later we had a guy come and say the Nazis were ok so Germany was fine now and that's about it
To a certain extent; yes
Until nowadays; definitely not
Well the EU and UN are primarily candidates since they were a direct result of anti war on Europe and anti war in general do to ww2 atrocities, there's also the American base in Açores but apparently the Americans stored illegal radioactive material and accidentally contaminated the some of the locals near the base having several cases of cancer link to that
Neither actually
But stuff much older than that still has an effect on our foreign policy
We are totally capable of never ever letting Olivença go without having it compromise our diplomatic relationship with Spain, and we invoke much older things occasionally
OTOH we have a particular concept of foreign policy which is basically very slow at changing ever and very consistent throughout decades or longer
>  but 20 years later we had a guy come and say the Nazis were ok so Germany was fine now and that's about it
Actually Salazar didn't like Hitler
One of the reasons for Portuguese neutrality was to not bring Spain to the Axis side
Yep, we do as well
Ever heard of *La Lys*?
No, he was friends with Hitler and Mussolini too
The only reason why Portugal didn't fight in WW2 was because we were sending shipments of ammunition to Germany while still allied with Britain
Spain was clouded in it's own civil war, don't bring her into this
[Portugal's role in keeping Spain neutral]
Base das Lajes leased to the british, also in this wikipedia article:
> In 1942 Lajes Field on the Azores was assigned the name Air Base No
4[4] and the Portuguese government expanded the runway and sent troops and equipment to Lajes, including Gloster Gladiator fighters
Military activity in the Azores grew as the Gladiators' role progressed into flying cover for Allied convoys, reconnaissance missions and meteorological flights
In August 1943, Portugal signed the Luso-British agreement, which leased bases in the Azores to the British
This was a key turning point in the Battle of the Atlantic, allowing the Allies to provide aerial coverage in the Mid-Atlantic gap; helping them to hunt U-boats and protect convoys
[5] Churchill surprised members of parliament (MPs) when he said he would use a 14th-century treaty; many MPs had not known that Portugal and England had the oldest operational alliance in the world, the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1373

Literally
It depends on the subreddit
On /r/migraine or /r/chronicpain definitely because people focus mostly on the American healthcare system, but on scientific subreddits not really
I do
Usually in issues relating with education, career and finances
The advices they give are completely disattached from my reality
Also we don't have racial issues or politically correct movements here
If they're mostly American and Canadian, yes, I do
Yes
Everything about insurance and access to medication is so weird in the US
I knew about it from migraine articles but reddit really opened my eyes
Being wholesome can be good but I in my view wholesomeness implies honesty
American white feminism TM is too widespread nowadays, and that can be a problem online
On the other hand, I understand that American feminist spaces should be first and foremost inclusive for American minorities, instead of foreigners
They're the ones dealing with the American reality
We do have racial issues here
We just had Mário Machado on TV
A frustrated dick head with probable sexual impotence is hardly a racial issue
I flirt more in English because the words don't seem to have the same impact to me and I become less afraid of making sexual inuendo and jokes
That happens to me when I'm speaking German
I sound like a Disney princess
Now imagine Portugal (at least Lisbon, but its getting bad everywhere) ... Same costs as you said, half the salary
Lisbon: Portuguese custard tart, Jerónimos Monastery, fado, Belém Tower, Terreiro do Paço, the zoo and the aquarium, arrogant people, football
Oporto: Clérigos church, friendly hard-working people who are loud and swear a lot, strong Northern accent, Port wine, football, francesinha, Casa da Música, unbeatable people - the city is called 'invicta' (unbeaten)
Coimbra: 725+ year-old university, rich student traditions, fado, alternative, Quinta das Lágrimas (where Peter I and Inês de Castro would meet in secret)
Aveiro: ovos moles, bad smell, canals (the town is called the 'Venice of Portugal'), striped houses by the beach
Viseu: lots of roundabouts, Palácio do Gelo, a particular accent which is hard to describe through text, the legend of Viriathus
Where are the best copypastas
Astrakhan
Even though a lot of the city now looks slummy and grim, Astrakhan still is a wonderful place with some fairly nice quarters and a unique culture and history, being located on the edge of Russia next to Kazakhstan and belonging to Central Asia more so than it does to Eastern Europe
Astrakhan has been a melting pot of Central Asian, European, Caucasian and Middle Eastern cultures for centuries and still has a fairly diverse population
It actually has one of the oldest Catholic churches in Russia and the oldest Kalmyk Buddhist temple that survived the Soviet era, and the city has more mosques than Russian Orthodox churches
Astrakhan’s diversity is reflected in that racism is very rare there compared to most of Russia
It also have a lot of fascinating and atypical nature, including steppes, semideserts, deserts, red hills, salt lakes and the Volga river delta
There is also an abundance of quality copypastas
Galway : hookers
You've clearly never been to Galway
The Galway Hooker is a kind of boat, that proudly serves as name of many of the city's businesses
Op does this question also can apply to Portuguese and Spanish empires
Well younger portugueses people really don't care about the colonian past, and the older generation is a bit more complicated in general they don't care, the much much older generations are a "bit racist" (you know how older generation are)
We do value and have great pride in the discovery age and the sea adventure part
There are memes about saying "Angola é nossa" but its mostly banter
We do have a close friendly relationship with every ex colonies something most other European countries don't usually have
I don't know
Like most of generation of the ultramar war was lost to the greed of the fascist regime, the revolutionary forces here in Portugal that ended the regime and war is what we most focus on since it was the thing that stop the atrocitie of being oppress
I personally don't know much about Savimbi, i know a bit but not much
I only know he fought has one of independence movement, my guess is that some survivors of the war might not like him but i highly doubt that because everyone was a pawn blindfolded and forced to fight
Portugal has very uniform person names, and surnames
There are however a few exceptions in surnames , normally related to either the Alentejo region or the insular regions (Madeira and the Azores)
Alentejo has a huge diversity of surnames, that originally were probably nicknames or professional designations that have become surnames and generally allow you to tell that someone is from Alentejo, and sometimes you can even pin-point the village from where their family is originally
For instance, in my own genealogical research I've come up with several surnames:
* Morganho - this was one the many designations for rural worker
Most of the people that I've seen with the surname are from Santa Eulalia a small village in the Elvas municipally
* Cascabulho - undefined term related to peels (it could be vegetable peels or tree bark), everyone with that surname can be traced back to a family in Serpa (medium size village near the Spanish border in the left side of the Guadiana river)
The Azores received a significant amount of Dutch catholic refugees, during the independence war of the Dutch republic, and the are certain surnames that can be traced to those settlers, like "Brum" which was originally "Bruyn".
You also have surnames that derive from agriculture terms that are specific of those areas like "Fraga", which means water stream/source but really isn't used in other parts of the country
In Madeira, you have the predominance of the Perestrelo surname, which is a surname of Italian origin (originally Parasttrelli) and was the surname of the first governor of the archipelago (the son of an Italian nobleman), and became an important and relatively common surname in Madeira
The only thing that I can remember is the surname Bettencourt that is widely spread in Madeira and the Azores
If the person has Maria had his second name is probably from Cascais lol
The thing with those type of surnames is that from very specific areas, but if you aren't local it's hard to associate the surnames with a region
I'm from Algarve and I know a few surnames that are very typical from a certain area, like Marreiros from Lagos, Bailote from Albufeira or Caliço in Loulé. However, a Northerner certainly wouldn't associate those surnames with Algarve, but maybe could associate them only with the South in general
Also Barradas, seems to be a name associated with Évora region
Im Portuguese and I didn't know that
You are confusing two things:
* Cascaense - someone that is from Cascais
* Cascalense - posh person that lives in Cascais and has an affected speech pattern, creating an unnatural nasal voice
The first would not be caught dead with "Maria" has a second name, and frequently jumps off the "Rata" beach wave breaker
The second believes there is a beach called "Praia da Moitas" between Cascais and Estoril
Yes, unless you are familiar with the surnames, you struggle to pin point the exact region
My experience is that surnames are more uniform north of the Tejo than south of the Tejo
Northerner here
I've never even seen any of those surnames before
Peixinho- it's common in Portimão, and 2 other families one in Leiria, the other in Coimbra(? No 100%certain)
>I don’t know
French, maybe
It is probably french
It is a founder´s effect maybe, in which some names can become common after a few centuries particularly in islands
Some of the first azorean settlers came from Flanders or northern France
They got other dutch type names also like Brum, Hintze
The city of Horta is named after its founder use name was flemish-dutch but not sure there is a definite spelling on how it was spelled
Other relatively common names in islands, can differ from mainlands, founders effects
Tavares and Varela are regular but not top frequency portuguese surnames, but they are very very frequent cape verdean surnames
And then there is the van dunem family in Angola, a very famous political family  (including the current portuguese minister of justice and kind of the former president of Angola), their name comes from a dutch ancestor some centuries ago
I can only speculate here
I don't know for sure as well
The Bettencourt name seems to be more common in the the Azores
I once heard that once upon a time there lived a very influential french family in the Terceira Island
Even today the Terceira accent [sounds very french]
Aveiro is a city in north-central Portugal (look, it is northern to me, northernmost third of Portugal)
It is a place name
Santos is one of the most common surnames in the portuguese and spanish languages
I'm not knowledgeable in the genealogy of the Madeira region, but Aveiro might mean that the family originally came from Aveiro, perhaps even relatively recently
Very likely being that Aveiro is an important port city, and hence had significant maritime traffic with Madeira
As for "dos Santos", like u/uyth already said, it is a very common surname
Frequently (not always), it means that someone was a baby orphan placed in the "roda", a wheel that was outside monasteries and churches, where mothers wishing to abandon their new born child placed the baby in complete anonymity
The surname "do Espirito Santo" has the same origin
It's quite a popular male name among people from "good" families in Portugal, I have a baby cousin that has Maria as his second name
Not sure if it's related, that is what people from outskirts Sesimbra, call to the Sesimbra's natives
(basically what the farmers call the fishermen)
>sounds very french
That is in the (in)famous town of Rabo de Peixe in São Miguel, not Terceira
You have the explanation [here] It is of Normand origin, but afterwards they became an important family in the Azores, hence why it is so common there
> but Aveiro might mean that the family originally came from Aveiro, perhaps even relatively recently
place names are really common surnames in Portugal but I think almost none are correlated to recent origin from that place
Names like Albuquerque (a village in the raia), Braga, Évora, Lisboa, Aveiro, Castelo Branco, Coimbra, Guimarães, Maia, Serpa, usually do not mean the family can trace an origin to there, not recently though, maybe only in the middle ages
It is just a name
Like in english maybe York/Yorke can be  a family name
Very cool I never knew that "dos Santos" was linked to being orphan and being placed in the "roda", my great grandfather was abandoned/adopted and he had "dos Santos" in his name
The version we have is that he was left at the doorstep of a house but maybe that didn't actually happen
The family in Portimão work in the harbor, maybe it's a regular thing
I agree with you, many place surnames are relatively common, and cannot definitely be traced, at least recently to that given place
However, in this case, given that Aveiro as a surname is not common (at least that I have noticed), and that he is from Madeira
I would say probably it means that one of his ancestors was from Aveiro and for some reason settled in Madeira
Myself, one of my surnames is Granja, a relatively common surname, however in my particular case I've traced the name to a soldier named José Gonçalves, who served in Bucelas in the defenses protecting Lisbon during the Napoleonic wars
He was from Granja do Ulmeiro (near Coimbra), and hence took the surname Granja
You can easily check that by looking at his baptism church records
If he was left at a church institution, you might also finds records of his finding which generally detail the items that he was left with
Occasionally mothers left signs that latter would let them identify the child if their situation changed
If you want, PM me and I will point you in the right direction
It might be a local nickname that became a surname
Surnames only really became stable in the late XIX
Born and lived in Portugal until I was 18, moved to China to study and work and recently came back to Europe for a more stable and safer life
I don't see myself going back to Portugal until I'm well established with my career, job opportunities are subpar compared to the rest of Europe
I do however spend 90% of my holidays there
Não é por nada, mas quase tenho a sensação que te estou a dar stalk pois já associo a tua flair à história do namorado que é canadiano e que vem morar para Portugal :) Talvez porque visitamos muitas vezes os mesmos subs ahahah

Je suis trés content, parce que je suis trés content
I have no idea how it came about, I think it was a friend of my brother from ages ago who came up with it
It kind of became a meme among us and made its way into my psyche
I was lied to
Confirm
The calmness and the bright open blue sky
I've never noticed or valued it until I went abroad
That which made me want to go elsewhere, is also what made me miss Portugal the most
Everything here ends up seeming very stale
Being in Portugal is like being in "Europe's country side", it's very peripheral
But after being a long time in other big capitals, my god, Lisbon seems so modest and so  easy
Edit: I remember being several months in Barcelona and then arriving in Lisbon
The Sun shone in an empty blue sky and everything looked so small
I keep getting the same feeling upon each return
And now, I find myself cozy in the thoughts when I'm abroad and tired
Portuguese escudo banknotes
I really can't get used to those overly neutral euro banknotes
Would love to see some historical figures in it
I know it would be a lot of trouble choosing people universal enough to figure on those but it would be lovely to have some faces in the banknotes

Are they any cool youtube channels (or other things) that show off your country
("Are *there
Usually when I'm curious about what a country looks like I go to their wikipedia entry, but a lot of the time there aren't enough images featured that give a good idea as to what said country looks like
Recently I've began watching youtube videos that show off countries and which give a sense of what they look like
I'm wondering if anyone can suggest good youtube channels and/or videos that feature videos that show what your country looks like
Things like video tours and guides, overhead drone footage, or even travel vlogs
I particularly like POV videos shot with quality cameras and lenses
Also, they don't have to necessarily be on youtube
They can be on any platform
There's a channel called 360portugal which showcases drone footage from the bigger cities to small historical villages
Those are great
Thanks
Lmao people don't actually do that, do they
Also I love snow, but I'm sure I'd change my mind if it still looks like that in Spring
Oh yeah that's a good one
My only issue, which isn't that big tbh, is that the colours look a bit weird in some of the videos
Oh yeah I've been watching that one
It's a really good channel that one
At first I was scared it would just be him mocking the places he visits but he's actually super sympathetic to the people living there and he does try to highlight the positive qualities
I wasn't expecting so many replies
I'm very thankful to everyone who's shared their recommendations
And do the clothes manage to dry
I hang my clothes out as well, but when it rains (or looks as though it's going to rain) I just hang them indoors
I wouldn't consider it the worse, actually I'd say most people in Portugal are proud of it, we are the biggest trollers the world have had, sad only we know it
Take a look  [Caralho]
It was a national hit but I honestly don't like the song
"Parti o telemovel"
I think that was the name, that singer with the dancing dude, basically his song is about how he broke his phone
Why Portugal, why
At least it wasn't the Israeli chicken lady
All of them except maybe three (I could be reaching tho)
[The one that led us to victory]
Almost all of your entries since 2013 have been good, though
And your winner in 2019 is amazing
I love how we collectively decided to completely repress from our memories from the 2004-2007 period at Eurovision and don't even think of them when we're asked this question
I mean, we have [this]
It lacked cultural context
I look at that clip and go "That shit's pretty funny". But if you're not in the know, it just looks dumb
Do it for you lover was very bad
I'm sorry
"Paper" is an awesome song in the studio, but all the bad decisions that were possible to be made *were made* regarding the live performance
"This is My life" is the best 2000s 90s song
Not winning does not mean they're bad
It does not mean they're bad at all
There's over 40 countries, the likelihood of anyone winning Eurovision nowadays is completely different than it was 30 years ago
And sometimes, a song can be amazing, but then some bad decisions with the staging or an underwhelming delivery by the singer can ruin its live performance
"Occidentali's Karma", the Italian entry of 2017, "failed to win" because the staging was subpar and the magic that it had in Sanremo just wasn't there
But it doesn't stop it from being one of the best and most loved Eurovision songs of the decade
I actually love that song, but I have a thing for 80's synthpop
The UK has a peculiar perspective on Eurovision, due to various factors
It's basically a sum of:
* The already outsider feeling when it comes to Europe in general, causing them to sometimes fail to understand why other countries' songs are doing well and getting angry at Europe for not voting for them, because "tHEy Don'T LikE Us".
* Years and years of success in Eurovision since
ever, really until 1997 which completely skewed their concept of success in the show and gave them their mentality into "any result below 5th place is a disaster".
* Years and years of Terry Wogan (and currently Graham Norton) commentating the live shows with a sarcastic tone and making jokes at the performances and the countries, which made people watch the show for their commentary and not for the actual music show
This also ultimately led to the mindset that all votes are political and unfair as Terry Wogan ever more bitterly emphasized that in his commentary throughout the years (espeically when countries from Eastern Europe and the Balkans started to join the show)
With all of this, no serious artist wants to risk their reputation going to Eurovision as it's currently a career killer
Also, Eurovision is a 3-month endeavor at least and is completely non-paid throughout
No reputed artist will sacrifice their schedules without seeing a penny
Why would you do this to me
I'd completely forgotten about the Dark Ages of Eurovision
Also [this]
This usually happens the years after we send a good song and Europe completely shits on us
Five
No football that day
We friends
We had so many points we wanted to share some of them
Solidarity
It was a truly terrible song, and we know all about having shit songs
We didn't want you guys to have to go through that alone

[This] was the highlight of "Do It For Your Lover" (Spain 2017)
In 2018 and 2019, Greece had amazing songs, but they singers just didn't really deliver them that well live
But studio versions are great
But there was a sense of self-awareness there, which made it good
It's the ones that try to pass off as something serious when they're not that are usually the worst
How was Eurovision in Italy unknown in the 90's? You literally hosted it in 1991
Also, "Fiume di Parole" is a hell of a song
I actually enjoy that song, but I agree the live performance is one of the worst in our history
>the public perception of Eurovision is stuck in about 1975 with lamé costumes, nonsense "bing-bang-a-bong" lyrics and wobbly cardboard sets
One of the things that completely shocked me regarding the UK was when a couple of years ago, the UK had a national final (I think it was 2018), and they had a panel of guests commentating on the songs
I don't fully remember who those people were, but I remember at some point in the show, they were asked what was their favorite Eurovision song ever
Didn't have to be a winner, just a favorite Eurovision song
2 out of 3 answered "Waterloo" and the third one answered "Heroes", the winner song from 2015
Because one of the hosts of the show was Måns Zelmerlöw.
Who sang "Heroes" at Eurovision 2015 and won
These were people invited to comment on and evaluate songs for the UK to send to Eurovision and you could tell they clearly couldn't name more than 2 songs out of over 1,500 entries
I'm a Eurovision fan in general
Well, you just proved most of my points, though
The UK has that mentality that Eurovision is bad and tacky and that's how it's supposed to be, fueled by years of conditioning by the BBC commentary
It's not
Eurovision is supposed to be a serious music contest, and more importantly, a serious, entertaining, quality TV show
Most other countries take it seriously, and especially in later years, even if they still fail to recruit their top talent to the show, due to its damaged reputation from the 2000s and the fact it's not a remunerated endeavour, like you said
That alone is enough to scare them away
But you still see countries putting some effort and trying to step up the song quality and their production quality
There's still the odd gimmick and silly song here and there, but the years of full wackiness and gimmicks are now gone
Also, calling out "Toy" just for the chicken noises, and the other songs over their theme and visuals the is *precisely not understanding why they did well* and thus failing to replicate what made them good
"Toy" was a very original and unique song, instrumentally and vocally, very reflective of Netta's own unique music style and the country it came from, about woman empowerment in a year where the #MeToo movement was going strong
The 2016 winner was a very emotional ballad with a chilling single moment, both vocally and visually that no one else in that year came close to replicate
The 2015 was just a radio-friendly pop song, but sang by a very charismatic singer and with a very strong and almost flawlessly executed visual performance
Eurovision is a TV show after all, this is part of it
The UK songs lately have had good singers, but the songs have been the blandest, soulless, vacuous crap anyone has seen
They have no originality, the lyrics are surprisingly bad, considering you literally invented the English language and there's no regard to how to properly visually present said songs to make them more compelling
The only recent year where there was any semblance of proper staging, which was 2017, ~~you came 11th place
Who knew actually putting some effort into it would work
And let it be said, 11th place is a GOOD RESULT~~. **EDIT:** *It finished 15th, like another user pointed out
My point still stands, it's a better result than usual
* There's over 40 countries now, at this point winning Eurovision is almost a lottery, it's just not going to happen as easily as it did when there were only 18 countries participating
On a side note, I find it funny that you decided to completely ignore 2017's or 2019's winners because they don't serve your argument
As for political voting, yes, there's still some, but it mainly affects qualification streaks - which is something the UK doesn't have to worry about - and the middle of the table, like the Cyprus/Greece, Romania/Moldova and Serbia/Montenegro pairings
For the last decade, the top 10 has actually been the top 10 best songs of that year
Yes, the song is not bad, but the performers are
The instrumental in the FdC version gives it some joy, but the voices are still bad
We still don't know if Little Big is coming back, but Daði Freyr is taking part in the contest again this year
>> Eurovision is supposed to be a serious music contest, and more importantly, a serious, entertaining, quality TV show
>No it isn't.
I feel like if this is where you start, there's no point in me keeping counter-arguing
But like I said, I still firmly believe that British people and the BBC not taking it seriously is half the problem of the UK not getting good results at the show
Eurovision is SO MUCH cheaper to produce than people think
The fact it draws money from 40 something countries and the fact there's a huge return for broadcasters in terms of ratings and brand awareness makes it so worthwhile
Like it was said, any single episode of The Voice or any other Saturday entertainment show costs double than what a Eurovision show costs
We did fight in WWI, but let's say it didn't went that well in like every front possible and we don't really celebrate (or even think about) the Great War like I've seen you do in the UK
The only thing we're really "thought" is that, there was a soldier who allegedly killed lots of Germans at the Battle of La Lys (which if you've never heard of it, was a allied disaster) and then saved a Scottish officer, nicknamed *Soldado Milhões*
Poppies are flowers of spring anyway, it is stupid they use them in November
Definitely not a thing in Portugal and we fought in WW1 as well
It’s even sadder that we lost so many people especially in the battle of La Lys and we, normal people, don’t really honor them :(
I still refer it as Czech Republic
I'm too used to calling it that
*Chéquia* is really weird in portuguese, i still prefer *Républica Checa*
In my language -chi- is read -shi- not -ki- so instinctively it changes the sound of pronunciation in a really stupid way
Czech you read with a k sound, but if you wrote it chia you read it shia and is just stupid
Plus a lot of z, ch sounds on a row
Same
I prefer it since most countries don't have "Republic" in them in common speech, but it **is** awkward to say in both English and Portuguese
Would it not just be "Chequia" in Portuguese
It sounds god awful
It would Chéquia at best and just looks and sounds quite bad
The embassy calls itself Embaixada da República Checa em Lisboa so that it will be  their official name in Portuguese
>How is this related
It is an english term, not protuguese one, in portugal you can call it Chéquie like brazilians, cant you
Actually no, Portuguese usage is different to Brazillian usage, different norms and it would be very stupid and be wrong
And I thought we were asked our opinion of the english term
Which is not an english word, and when presented out of the blue a word I had never encountered and with which I did not grow up my instinctive way of pronouncing it is the phonetical rules I learnt for my native language
>i dont see how using Chéquie would be problem for portuguese speaking, other than being it a foreign word
You understand so little of Portuguese you think it would be spelled with an -e at the end
It would be with an -a. And just like you do not get why Chéquie would be very wrong, you do not get why even when corrected also sounds badly
I did not want to correct your original spelling but it is worth pointing you got no instincts for what would be right or wrong in Portuguese
I absolutely agree with you, forget the other guy
The Portuguese Monarchical [flag] It was used from 1830 until 1910
White and blue were the traditional colours of the monarchy so in 1910 with the Republican Revolution the flag was changed to the colours of the Republican Party (red and green)
I think the old colours just go better together
Th eagle looks like it's about to sneeze
Not only does it work better together, it represents the country and our relationship  with the sea much better than red and green
That flag doesn't include the seas nor the Azores because it was used before the Age of Discoveries
The shields represent the 5 shields of the moorish kings our first king, Dom Afonso Henriques, defeated in the battle of Ourique
It is just a coincidence, but Teutonic knights were often associated with the archbishop of Cologne
"Envy" = "Inveja" vs "Jealousy" = "Ciúmes".
Honestly, I can't remember a case in my language where the two words are interchangeable
The second one, AFAICR, is only used in interpersonal relation contexts, whereas the other, while having a broader range of possible meanings is not used in those contexts
We have ciúme and inveja and despite having slightly different meanings ciúme is often seen as inveja
The opposite doesn't happen as much because ciúme is usually used only in romantic situations, while inveja can be used in a lot of different situations
Their specific meanings according to the dictionary are:
Ciúme: fear that other people's affection is not exclusively for us
Inveja: Desire to possess what someone has, usually accompanied by hatred for the possessor
Well, they aren’t, but in some cases people prefer to use jealous instead of envy (because they think it’s a negative thing)
“tenho ciúmes dessa tua camisola”.
Honnestly, I think I never came across that
But, considering all the other abuses our language is subject to, I have no problem in believing that some people would say something like :
"Que ciúmes que tenho do teu carro novo"
It sounds weird, but, sadly, not quite as weird as it should
It would be in here, but there people who take it seriously and avoid the word “envy” like the plague
Now there’s a new trend among them “inveja da boa”, like “tenho inveja, da boa, do teu carro” or to emphasize it “tenho inveja, mas da boa, do teu carro”.
Yeah, not usual, I came across it with people who avoid using the envy word
Sounds weird
Edit: a new trend among those is “inveja da boa” – see my other comment
There is no such thing as a dialect in Portuguese, at least not in the sense that one understands for other European countries (I lived in Umbria for two years, speak fluent Italian, and if someone talks to me in Perugino I struggle to follow)
Portuguese is a very uniform, even if you take in to consideration the other Portuguese speaking countries, with the exceptions of the creoles of Cabo Verde and Guinea, but those aren't really dialects but languages in themselves
This uniformity is due to several factors, firstly Portugal as been a single political entity since the twelve century, that exists to a large extent within the same borders on a previously existing Roman province
So internally there hasn't been any physical or political barrier that promoted differentiation
Also, from a historical perspective, Portuguese is really Galician spoken south of the Minho river
Politically, Portugal was born in the north, and expanded sound
In that expansion not only the language of the north was the official language, but also during the XII and the XIII centuries, due to the constant wars, the territory was significantly underpopulated, so there were movements of people coming from the north to the south, from northern Portugal and from Galicia, further ensuring language uniformity
The flow of population from Galicia to Portugal lasted until the early XX century
The only significant physical barrier that promoted some differentiation is the Atlantic ocean, Portuguese spoken in both the Azores and the Madeira islands is different from continental Portuguese
But again they always belonged to the same political entity as the mainland, and thus it always has been under some pressure to stay the same, especially in the last decades with TV and a much easier movement of people
So one would not really call it a dialect, but it is much more an regional accent of the same language with some local words
There is one notable exception, [Mirandes] which since 1999 as been granted the status of official language
It is spoken in a small region in northeastern Portugal, in a region stuck between the Douro river and mountains, which ensured it's isolation
However, it is a dialect but not of Portuguese, it belongs to the [Asturleonese] language a now practically extinct Iberian-Romance language
We have a lot of different accents, specially if you count Brazil and the other lusophone countries, but Portugal alone has a few as well, i would say around 10
They're all pretty much understandable with only a few differences in pronounciation and grammar
The hardest ones to understand are probably the ones from the islands (Madeira and Azores) as they have a thicker accent
>hundreds of thousands of speakers in Spain
The [UNESCO] ranks the Asturleonese as a "Definitely endangered" language, and estimates the number of speakers to be 150 000, which is only technically "hundreds of thousands", and is expected to go extinct in two generations
It is far from being an example of vitality
We call it Pfizer
I am sure the 20 something billion Euros that Biontech got in the last year is smoothing the name pain
Usually "Pfizer vaccine". Sometimes, usually in writing, "Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine". Though BioNtech did get a lot of media attention back when the vaccine was about to be approved
I occasionally see Pfizer-Biontech, but it's rare
English, German, Italian, French, Spanish (Castellano) and Portuguese
Obrigado in Portuguese of course
Some variation of Gracias in Spain
Merci in French and kinda in Romania
Tak for the Scandinavia region
Danke for Germany and Germanic friends
Italian, Grazie
Russian and Im assuming Ukrainian, Spasiba
and thank you ofc
Oh, interesting
TIL
Just to add that it originally was used as an expression that meant "I'm obliged/bound to you," so it does need to be declined by gender
It says a lot about or knowledge and relationship with the rest of European history
Reminds a party where a Portuguese pal was talking about Hitler and second WW and suddenly asked a Polish: “What would you do if your country was invaded by Hitler
Edit: or a friend of mine who, looking at a sport jacket with DDR embroidery in it,  was wondering what football team was it
I mean who even got offended by it
We don't ha é Irish people here and I assume most people wouldn't understand the reference
It was obviously unintentional

[Vikings invaded a northern city in Portugal] way before we were a country
Has evidence of a Viking settlement,  there is higher percentage of blonde people with blue eyes than in any other part of the country
Untill this day we use [runes] in boats and "sweaters" which are Viking inspired
Portugal faced the Ottomans several times in the Indian Sea
The costs of those battles and their parcial success made the spice trade unprofitable and so the portuguese decided to turn to South America to cover those expenses, and this is how Brazil was born
The Military Order of Christ is the former Knights Templar order as it was reconstituted in Portugal after the Templars were abolished on 22 March 1312, and it's still active, with the President of the Portuguese Republic as its Grand Master
In Portugal, there’s a whole music style based on perverted music
It’s called “Pimba”
There are pleanty of evidence that the Portuguese knew about America before at least 1498
(The Portuguese crown had  a secrecy policy because if the spanish knew that portugal discovered a whole new continente they could invade
At the time portugal had 1 million population spread across portugal, Africa, midle east, india and far east, and spain had about 5 million concentraded on their mainland
So it is thought that the portuguese crown sent columbus ( really close to the portuguese royal family) to "discover" America to distract the Spain
Our football team bears the order's cross, if you look closely
I think the air force also uses the symbol
The king (don't remember which) refused to expell the order from Portugal because it had been a valuable ally
Was also thanks to the order that Portugal was able to kick-start the age of discoveries
The order kept ancient science documents and other documents from Islamic scholars, which was prohibited by the church
Portugal took this knowledge and built the first global Empire
Also fun fact, one of the symbols, the armillary sphere, is in the flag, making Portugal the only country in the world (I think) to have a scientific device in it's flag
On the other hand, we eat snails
They're called caracoletas
Innuendo would be a better description
So cool
We have something really similar called “Bolinho de Chuva”
I prefer appelflappen, those are so good
Francis Drake's ships also looted Peniche and destroyed Sagres, while they were supposed to be helping the Portuguese defend against the Spanish
We have the expression "Friend from Peniche" (*Amigos de Peniche*) that means a fake friend, it originates from that time when the Portuguese were holding on in Lisbon waiting for the English to help, who they thought were in Peniche getting ready, their friends from Peniche who never came
It’s different than hip hop, because they use words with two meanings
I think the most similar style in terms of meaning would definitely be disco polo
For example, what I understand from the videoclip of "[Ona lubi pomarancze] is that she leaves her fiancé at the altar because she loves oranges, which means she likes women (oranges as a metaphor for boobs)
Am I reading that correctly
This is what our Pimba does
We have songs saying stuff like "I put the car in the neighbours' garage at any time I want" (= I insert my penis in my neighbours' vagina at any time I want) or using metaphors to compare people with animals (mostly farm animals)
The portuguese sailor's had already been close to that area, because when coming from India to Lisbon the winds that are favorable push the vessels towards brazil
Moreover, when columbus crossed the atlantic he used the maritime currents and only the portuguese sailed on those waters
Also, when coming back to Spain, columbus stopped in the Azores and was jailed, because they thought he had betrayded Portugal by giving Spain the new world, the Portuguese king realesed Columbus because ( due to the scheme)
There is also a theory that Columbus was a portuguese nobleman that , hence he was married with ( probally the most powerfull woman at the time) a member of the royal family
According to this theory columbus was from a Town called Cuba ( in portugal), it is thought he named Cuba after his Homeland
This is all specullation, but has a good chance of being true
Also, a fun fact, there is a portuguese map showing the Florida peninsula 8 years before it was "discovered". The map was kept in secret for many years
As I said, its all speculation
But your argument is flawed
To navigate across the ocean you need to have reading skills, math, astrology, navigation, and rank
A fisherman could never sail across the atlantic, everybody at the time KNEW the earth was round
Columbus was married to the sister of the king, therefore he was married to one of the most powerfull woman in the world  he could never have been a monority, much less a fisherman, he was a nobleman and had an entire island that produced lucrative sugar
Moreover, he probally had formal education as his Portuguese was flawless, but his Spanish had some "portuguese-like" words that arent that way in spanish
Is it Socorro or something like Maria de Socorro
Yes, also typically names like that are prefaced Maria in Portugal, so I was curious if it's the same in Spain
We have our [own martial art]
It's called "stick game".

Nós também dávamos luta a esses cabrões todos, caralho
Wow, really cool the read about all this surreal parties I never ever heard about
Thank you
Unfortunately, I cannot contribute to this thread, because I don’t think we have (or ever had) parties like these
Only far right or far left, some related to retired people or monarchy, but those don’t count, I guess
The PURP (Partido Unido dos Reformados e Pensionistas/United Party of Retirees and Pensioners) literally just boomers, it's a party of retired people only
The only thing everyone ok that party agrees is that they are anti-austerity
That sounds like good politics
This needs to be an International
Movement
Long Live the First AntiPowerPoint International
Even I would support that
As you said, we have the PURP: Retirees and pensioners party
That in itself is a bit absurd
The funny part is they have a political youth wing
Then there’s also PCTP-MRPP, which is a sideline maoist party that refers to the more mainstream PCP - portuguese communist party - as “social-fascists”
O André ventura e joacine acho que ainda tinham lugar aqui
You most definitely could
There's also RIR (reagir, incluir e reciclar) led by Tino de Rans their main objective is to 'recicle' Portuguese democracy through citizen participation and inclusiveness
yeah we have  PCP-PEV ( Portuguese Communist Party  and Green Party coalition, most commonly known as CDU) and BE (Left Block, a "New far left party")
Both made part of the government last legislation with PS (Socialist Party)
This legislation has only PS on the government with about 36% votes, but they are backed sometimes by PCP-PEV and BE, and sometimes PPD/PSD (Social Democratic party, I guess a center-right/ conservative-liberal party)
And they are well represented in the parliament and still dominate politically a lot of unions
Se a pergunta fosse em relação à políticos, acredito que sim
And "RIR" means "to laugh" in portuguese
Yeah, I get confused too when I see german elections
Maybe Romania
I'm a bit curious but why Portugal
I don't think so, but in my experience trains aren't particularly noisy
Maybe because when I do take them I take the early morning one towards Lisbon, so its mostly people travelling for work and trying to either get some extra sleep or extra work
Sometimes you get people talking to each other, but most tend to speak quietly anyway
I suppose trains filled with university students and younger people have a different environment
We have trains but not where I live :(
Guimarães, small old city to the north of Portugal, even the food is amazing
Porto is great and I love it but Lisbon has my whole heart
The vibe is amazing and I wish I could live there
I'll have to go for Lisbon
It's my home, almost always has been, the place where I was born and where I created my best memories
It has stuff other Portuguese cities don't. It's, by far, the biggest city, it has that cosmopolitan feel which, in my opinion, at least, is kind of lacking in other cities, Porto included
There's everything here, a little too many tourists tho, ngl
The weather is just fine with only two very hot and two very cold weeks a year (very hot being 40ºC and very cold being close to 0ºC)
It's safe, beautiful (some parts) and a pleasure to live in
I looove Warsaw and Gdansk
They have such unique vibes
I really liked the old part of the city, the sea, and it had some interesting museums
It also is a very clean and bright city compared to other ones in Poland
In general I really liked the feel of the modern city
I'm actually learning German and that sub has helped so much
And it's really good meme wise
I filter hundreds of subreddits that have a chance to appear in r/popular
I also ignore (using RES, their posts and comments completely disappear) trolls and people whose opinions are not worth listening to
I don't really care about reddit recipes anyway
Most of them are basically something nice covered by 3kg of butter/cheese/sugar that take an afternoon to make
I remember that when I was in primary school we went to a home for mentally disabled people once, and I recall being shocked at the state of it
It wasn't at all a modern facility, rather some old building that I imagine had been there for many decades
It was damp and clearly had some insulation problems (there was also mold in certain parts)
I remember thinking to myself how such a place could be in that state, and just felt awful for the people living there
Everything about that home looked run-down and felt depressing
I had a similar experience when on another occasion we visited an orphanage
While not as bad as the home for the disabled, I still felt sorry the kids had to live in such a place
It just didn't seem very inviting or cozy like a home should feel
Made me realize just how fortunate and privileged I truly was
In 1940 Portugal sent Humanitian aid to Finland, why
Finland had just beaten USSR and the portuguese facist regime hated communists, as the Finnish people were facing food shortage, food was sent from Portugal
It wasn't much but it was honest food aid
Portugal and Venezuela have had some peculiar diplomatic incidents
They accused us of transporting explosives to Venezuela via our national airline and also accused Portugal of illegaly transporting Juaido's uncle
They accused Portugal of blocking covid vaccines to their country along with Spain, England and the US
And lastly Nicolas Maduro accused Portugal of sabotaging the transport of pork ham to Venezuela, thus ruining their typical Christmas dish
Now they rely on Russia for that lmao
Also Venezuela has a big Portuguese community (used to be more), so it's kinda weird all this conflict
According to legends, Władysław III of Poland (Also king of Hungary), survived the Battle of Varna then he settled on Madeira island and probably die there too
It just a legend about this King of Hungary exiled after a military disaster (Battle of Varna)
BUT I like to think it's funny that the last King of Hungary also die in Madeira Island exiled because a military disaster (WW1) with connection to the legend
So yeah, if you are King of Hungary and did poorly in military stuff, just go to Madeira
Then we got insulted by some Finnish governmental official around the euro crisis in 2012/13
which led to this absolute gem of a masturbatory history video about the stuff we've been doing for the last centuries, we want them to know about:

We won a Eurovision song since then

I read the official investigation report (in Portuguese) just for kicks and trust me it was extremely enjoyable  as a read, better than 99% of "humor" fiction published
Would recommend
The people writing that report, living the dream, some people got all the luck
I'm half-Portuguese, half-British, specifically Scottish
I identify with both countries, but I'd be lying if I said I don't feel more Portuguese then I do Scottish
This is because I grew up and lived most of my life in Portugal, I went to school and university here, most of my connections are with Portuguese people, and Portuguese is the language I use most in my daily life
That being said my mother (who's Scottish) has always tried to make me aware of my other identity
This wasn't always for the best, as I remember being exposed a little too much to the British expat scene, which has always felt alien to me
But I'm thankful for being exposed to British media from a young age, and being able to learn English at home
I really do love Scotland though
It's a place I tend to go back to every year, be it to visit that side of my family, or to explore parts which I'd never been to before
It's my home away from home in other words
And I was very fortunate to have had the chance to do my master's there and experience living in Edinburgh for a year
In some ways it made me feel more Portuguese than ever, yet on the other hand I feel as though it reinforced my Scottish heritage
I finally experienced what it's like to actually live Scotland rather than it just be a place I go on holiday for two weeks
Portugal, despite its issues, is the place I see myself in in the future
That being said, I was trying to return to Scotland and get a job there, but the pandemic put a halt to those plans
I'm half Portuguese half Brazilian almost the same thing
Basically me, but substitute Irish for Scottish and Spanish for Portuguese
I do have the accent though
What small moments in your country's history changed the entire course of history
For example, when Napoleon's troops reached Lisbon, they only missed the royal family's ship by an hour, approximately
If they had arrived a bit earlier, the court would have never left for Brazil
A very religious boy decides to go to North Africa to go to war against others religious boys, disappears, and blue balls everyone until these day every time there's fog
To be honest, we still think he was a nutjob
We had spies going by land towards India, so the king knew he was full of shit
Plus, when Columbus came back he landed in Portugal before going back to Spain and he bragged
8 Years later, we landed in Brazil
Don't forget: right after the 7 years war was lost and France's economy was in ruins
It's not really that he was a "nutjob", or that the king knew he was "full of shit". The thing is that those voyages needed a extraordinary amount of resources to pull off, so there was a limited amount of voyages you could actually support
Besides, Columbus didn't simply "get lost", as it's now common to say
He was following our navigation maps
Navigators were supposed to follow closely africa's shoreline, but then needed to go deep into the ocean, to avoid strong currents that would fuck up the ships
Columbus just went too deep into the ocean and found the Caribbean
Not only that but the king also had spies, like Pêro da Covilhã, who gave him reliable information that India was on the opposite side of the world
Listening to Columbus would be a very expensive shot in the dark
Not sure if this is taught to foreigners, but in Portugal we rarely use the second-person plural nominative personal pronoun **vós** (the plural "you" basically)
It's archaic, instead we use **vocês**, and the verb conjugation differs
In Portuguese we say "Que tal
" to ask what the other person thought of something or whether something went good for them
Does it also have that meaning in Spain
Examples: A friend tries a food or drink for the first time, they take a bite/sip, you ask "Que tal
". Or for the second meaning, you see a friend after an important presentation they had to do, you ask "Que tal
(And in our case it sounds more like "ktal" because we hate vowels
Huh, in Portuguese it also means ready
And it's also something we say either after reaching a conclusion/decision or before we start to discuss or take care of something
I guess an English equivalent would be "Alright then".
They only translate the two major cities in Portugal:
Lisboa - Lisbon
Porto - Oporto
The rest, they just mispronounce it
( They = British tourists that invade Portugal by the summer)
Where's The Shire
In portuguese we write it like Sófia for that reason
That way we open the "o"
I really hate the "Oporto" translation
I dont really know why but I think it's so useless
But yes they totally butcher Coimbra, Algarve and Sintra (the ones I hear mispronouncing the most)
From German, possibly
It's also Lissabon in German
You lovely capital is named Helsínquia in Portuguese
Well, the chain was founded by a Portuguese ao, probably now you know where the name came from ;)
I translated how we say it in Portuguese in a literal way ahahah I know it sounds weird
Can't do the phonetics in Finnish, sorry
One of my favorite is from over there but I can't speak a word
Let's try in english:
Hell - sin - kia ( like the korean cars)
Corvo island
In Portugal maybe the region of Alentejo
Basically the interior that is far from the main cities
If we're disregarding the mainland, then [the Savage Islands] are probably the most remote part of the country
Literally no one lives there except a handful of scientists
It is a huge problem here in Portugal, it is a process that has started in the 50's, and has never stooped
The interior is hemorrhaging people, and in some places it has just become simple unsustainable, with whole villages just empty of people
While at the same time, life in Lisbon and to a minor extent Porto, as become hellish, with too many people for too little infrastructure
The problem is exacerbated by our over-centralized form of government, that always puts the needs of the Lisbon (and to a much minor extent Porto) ahead of everyone else
Rural exodus is and has been the usual run of things around here, for quite some time, now
There are many villages in the countryside suffering from serious desertification
There's even so much as ghost villages, that have been abandoned altogether
Depends, if u are rich city asshole, u go live in a village and be an asshole when a village has village stuff (church bell, dogs barking, chickens clucking, geese, cow and horse shit)
If u are a normal person u will either stay in your town if it's close enough to a city, or move to the city
>Expand Lisbon to cover the rest of the country
To some extent that is happening
The Lisbon metropolitan area is getting bigger and bigger, with people commuting from farther and farther away, sometimes on our decrepit rail-road 1950's infrastructure
People spend sometimes more than on third of their work week commuting, it is a huge burden for everyone
Personally I prefer the approach of allocating new services to the interior of Portugal for example in Fundão you now have some IT services with offices there and call centres instead of only having it on Lisbon which is kind of impossible to have a good life quality as the rents are higher and even the quality for children to grow up it’s not as good
I know people who will disagree but if you have grew up in a village and you know close people who grew up in a big city you will understand that ok they had more tools to learn, library’s museum’s all this cultural life that you hadn’t, but for me I always traveled to this kind of places in school trips but at the end of the day I had more freedom to play in the street, go to my friends place and nicer close bondings with family then them
The only problem is when you get to university level and/or start to look for jobs small towns have nothing similar to the amount of offers and different areas like Lisbon and Porto
While not exactly what you're asking, I really do feel uneasy seeing people at the beach put their towels right next to cliffs despite there being prevalent signage warning against that
There've been quite a few incidents in which parts of said cliffs have broken and fallen on people
Similarly, a lot of people ignore those signs when trying to take photos at the top of those same cliffs, which has resulted in some deaths
It is not really a sign, but when you get weather warnings or interdictions to go to beaches or coastal roads over "coastal" events, the size of the waves can be a bit scary
On the mainland I think I have never seen prediction of waves taller than 20 meters, but on weather forecasts the Azores sometimes get weather warnings of waves from 20 to 30 meters
Not something you want to encounter, LOL, anywhere, particularly at the place the wave breaks
Not only for photos
People like to climb or go down cliffs to get a nice fishing spot
Many, oh so many, people have died or gone missing like that
Yet they just keep doing it
And yes, there are signs, warnings and even chains around those areas
And now I'm reminded of the kids that go those spots (as well as bridges and docks) just so they can dive off them to the water
It just makes me feel unneasy
Never heard of rugby players, teams or games in Portugal in my entire life, even if there is some popularity, rugby would still be completely overshadowed by football
, shit's wild here
Football/Soccer overshadows every other sport
Our prime minister even said that hosting the UCL final is a prize for all the healthcare workers
Even tho Rugby was also called Rugby Football (I think), it has virtually minimum attention, especially compared to the other Football
Portugal national team it's called "Os Lobos" (wolfs) and it's a sport that's supported/played essential by a universitarie elite
It's beyond a lot of other sports in popularity of the main population
It is overshadowed by football, but, compared to all the other sports, it has some popularity in Portugal, specialy in Lisbon
In Lisbon, there are a lot of teams, some of them conected to the universitys, like Direito, Técnico, CDUL, etc; other owned by football clubs, like Sporting and Belenenses
Some teams are already professional
It is considered a sport played by betos, that, according to the dictionary is preppy in english
To me, the stereotype is that rugby is a sport played by the rich people, by the "betos de Cascais"
In Coimbra it's very well known too
And it was a big thing when we reached the world cup
We played it in highschool too
Oh I didn't know
Maybe it's just me who isn't open to the rugby world in Portugal then
UHT treated milk, in tetra pack air-tight packages only needs to be put on the fridge after it is open
It will last 6 months or so out of it
"Fresh" milk which tastes nicer is supposed to always be kept refrigerated
Our climate is too warm and there is this cultural thing about milk products  going bad (brucelliosis
) and dangerous if not refrigerated all the time, apart from cheese obviously
Eggs do not need to be refrigerated and never are on the market circuit
But once they are refrigerated they need to be kept refrigerated always (because condensation will wash off the bloom and they became more porous and permeable to infection from environmental pathogens) and they keep fresher if they are refrigerated so after purchase I usually keep them in the fridge
Eggs aren't refrigerated in the supermarket, but we put them in the fridge anyway
We buy UHT milk and don't refrigerate it most of the year
In the summer, we always keep one litre in the fridge
Why would you put eggs on the refrigerator
They don’t go bad and you don’t need them cold since  most of us don’t eat them raw
Thank you man, really detailed, just one question, are industrial sold eggs never refrigerated during packing or transporting
Is this a "global" thing
It is an European thing
Eggs are not washed and as such are not refrigerated
Chlorine Washed chicken is another thing
It is a matter of regulation imposing stricter higiene rules in chicken farms because things can not Be disguised or made compliant by washing eggs or chlorine washing meat
Might be a climate thing
In Denmark when moving refrigerated eggs to home fridge likely it might not condensate and wash off the egg cuticle too much because it is not hot enough
But in summer anything I buy refrigerated is all damp when I get it home
I never drank milk without it being UHT
It's the most common here in Portugal
Same in Portugal
In the old days they use to persuade you to eat it all and was considered disrespect if you didn't.
Nowadays its actually encouraged by the waiters / restaurant owners if they see you left some food on the plate
Except if it is a fancy restaurant
It depends on the restaurant
If it's a fancy restaurant you wouldn't ask for the leftovers I'd say and the portions tend to be smaller so there's probably no need for that but if you go to a "normal" restaurant the portions are huge
I'm a small girl, I don't eat that much so I either ask for half a portion when that's available or I'm definitely taking the leftovers home
Even if I don't eat them myself I give them to my dog
I hate to waste food
It's not, you can take it home if you want, i've done it a few times
I just don't notice it being very usual for people to do so here, maybe because they make sure to ask for the right portion when they order the food
Interesting
"Mesa Galega" means to finish the entire served meal over here (dishes and serving plates)
Portuguese [QWERTY layout] it has an extra dedicated Ç key, in the same place where the Spanish layout has the Ñ key
I use the Portuguese layout, which is basically QWERTY with an extra key for ç. We also have the tilda (~) and other accents like the ones in á and à.
QWERTY with the accents á, à, â and ã, plus ç since ç is superior c
Funny enough, there was actually a Portuguese layout in the time of type writters
either that or we used the French(?) AZERTY, don't remember
Althought there are tons of Roman ruins and Roman cities (Braga, Coimbra, etc) and of course our Latin culture (and as an extra the river Lima in the north also has a interesting story as a Roman legion passing by thought it was the mythical river that made anyone who crossed it lose their memory, so the Roman general had to cross alone and call every soldier by name to prove it wasn't true), but I would say we are far from the proudest descendants of Rome when it comes to the Latin world, as our Lusitanian descendance and the myths of the Lusitani leader Viriato who defendend his people against the Romans until being ultimately betrayed by his own bribed men are all more engraved in our cultural identity
I'd say
I remember learning history in elementary school ( they basically devided it in the invasions: Celtiberians, Romans, Germans, Arabs, reconquista, independance
) And when we learned about the Romans there was more of a Lusitanian pov, "the hardest people to conquer by the Romans", basically the gauls in Asterix
And then we have Luís Vás de Camões, a very influential Portuguese poet (the day of Portugal is based on his birthday
or death
I don't remember) and in his lifework epic Os Lusiadas(Luso, Lusitanian) he spoke for the abandonment of the Greek and Roman heroes of the respective Greek and Roman epics and for the endorsment of the new heroes of Portugal, aka Vasco da Gama, a main character of his epic
All that and of course Luso literally meaning Portuguese descent clearly shows the impact both Romans and the Lusitanians had in Portugal
So I'd say our best bros Spain
them or Greece
I’d say we were pretty well romanized from top to bottom, every major town/city has some sort of Roman legacy and there are several remnants from that time, mostly well preserved and protected
They were a huge empire and civilization, I can’t say that wasn’t cool and they made some pretty impressive stuff as well
Man what I wouldn’t give to see how my home town was back then
I do this
I honestly don't give a shit
I'm human, you're human
I have a baby, I want him to see outside, see that there's an entire world waiting for him, and closed curtains don't do that
>That the Swiss are bat shit crazy about "privacy" but are completely fine disclosing everything under the sun to rent an apartment
Do they have a choice
What you are listing seems pretty normal for a portuguese landlord to ask prospective tennants, and a guaranteer at that
it is really hard to evict a tennant even for non payment, so at least honest landlords (those who give out legal contracts and receipts, those who are not planning ilegal evictions) will be paranoid about who they are renting to
The landlord is giving the tennant acess to something very expensive and where they can do lots of damage
Your first 2 points can easily be solved by tile floors
No problem with water whatsoever and takes 30 seconds to mop them down every other day
But I guess it's not fun having tile when your winter temps go negative
> Kitchens are already bad enough with a dishwasher, ever having the danger of spewing out the water and destroying the kitchen floor (20-30k renovation
what kitchen floors do you have
You are talking about wood right
that is a big mistake, big, it is very rare here kitchen floors are not hardwearing ceramic
So you put the washing machine, which might spill, on the same place as the dishwasher which might spill, as the fridge who might defrost and drip and so on
>Cash is just way too dangerous,
where are you now
Finland or outside
I am really not afraid of being mugged, and I am in Lisbon and extra paranoid on tourist-y places
But if you avoid the tourists and the scum which preys on them (disguised as other tourists), not particularly afraid of being mugged or pickpocketed
>Why would it be tacky
It would be wasteful if it would just be thrown out, no
it is up to the host to decide
They usually try to make people take leftovers with them, and sometimes it is more fun, because you bring bits of different leftovers, not just what you brought
About the booze, even in universities, bringing back what you brought, or not sharing what you brought, it would be a big anti-social thing
People would say nothing, but you would be seen a selfish rude person
Titus, get the cross
>But a lot of times the regie requires the current tenant to collect the dossiers (documents) on behalf of them
ah, ok, I understand
In case tennant is leaving early or it is the tennant responsability to find a replacement
Yeah, it is weird
And housing seems insanely competitive indeed, probably worse there but I think it is becoming insanely difficult in most of Europe
And it is not just about money, but fear of noise, or anti-social behaviour in general
It is really interesting how some cultural differences affect things which seem so subtle and free choice like where to put washing machines
If I lost my wallet, it would cost me lots of money anyway to replace all the documents on it, and a lot of fuss
It is the cash which would worry me more
I see about the tiles then, on unheated houses and such
I suppose you can winterize empty houses by draining water and sewer pipes
and we do not really heat houses, as a whole, every hour in winter, electricity bills also
>Replacing the documents and cards would be covered by insurance here
Do you have ID cards
Because here they are not mailing a duplicate of an ID card just on say so, you need to go pick it up or request it somewhere where they can check your biometrics
Also banks and stuff they usually are not that happy to send duplicated of credit cards without your physical signature and such
I think my point is, take care of your wallet, it is not just the money
>Empty house
I don't think such a thing exists in Finland
summer cabins
there are lots of those, right
Are they lived in throughout winter
It is weird you are so afraid of losing money and think it is unsafe but are not afraid of identity theft or abuse
I am not particularly worried about the cash or other stuff I carry, but I try to be very careful with my cards and ID
>95 % of the summer cabins we have don't have any water, electricity or such
ok, then only some of then
somebody gets a duplicate, or a new issue of a credit card in your name, and uses to do internet shopping on international sites for things which are used very fast or untraceable
That will cost money to somebody
Your own finnish ID card will likely be valuable on itself, as proof of citizenship for an illegal migrant , particularly elsewhere in Europe where nobody can judge if they speak finnish or act finnish or look finnish (sami people are finnish as well)
In Portugal a woman won a case when the company fired her without notifying her and that specific shit happened
They had to rehire her
Our current Prime Minister and the Socialist party allied with Communists and left wing extremists to remain in power
Does the people from the northern countries perceive tanned people as "not-healthy"?
I'm from Portugal and people here tend to consider tanned people "more healthy", saying things like "you got that nice summer look on you".
Does the reverse happen in the north
Although I tend to find tans aesthetically pleasing, I do always find it worrying when my friends say stuff like "I'm so WHITE
" despite them already being naturally olive-skinned
I also hate how my grandparents kind of pressure me to go out and get a tan like it's supposed to be something healthy
And despite thinking the obsession with tanning and not being careful around the sun to be a bigger problem with people from the UK, that's not to say that Portuguese don't underestimate what the sun does to their skin
You can always spot people at the beach with skin peeling off their shoulders for instance, as well as people who are clearly overtanned and look much older than they actually are
I think that regardless of skin tone people should really be careful with the sun and what it can do to your skin
The peeps from your country and others from the north only burn in here
Once some sweeds came to my grandads factory and had to go to the hospital after going to the beach
Here in Portugal we call Brits lobsters :D
Edit: and camones, which is a slang portuguese word twisted from “c‘mon”
Uv light does not necessarily only cause damage, it can also cause the synthesizing of vitamin d and is very important hormonally
Further melanin is itself repairing of anti oxidants on skin
It is all a balance but there is no risk 0 and sunlight is essential to human health
yeap
I'd say above the Alps everyone is a northerner
Dude, I'm Portuguese and I've had 2nd and even 3rd degree burns from the sun
I've literally bled from the tip of my ears from the sun
I can somewhat relate
Because of my celtic genes from my mum's side I'm more susceptible to getting sunburnt compared to my friends
I very rarely get sunburnt past noon, but if I'm not careful I can get a sunburn before that
This happened to me when I went to Rome, as my friends and I walked a lot from morning to night, and by the end of the trip I noticed that I had a slightly red farmer's tan despite it only being May
Meanwhile my friends looked no different
It also pisses me off how my dad can spend like 30 min max outside in the sun everyday and in four days he's already quite tan
Meanwhile I need to spend considerably more time out in the sun if I want to look noticeably darker
For us northern Portuguese it's probably 35ºC.
I like how you say up here
OK, people getting burnt yhea, but like that it's just when I went to Évora or Algarve
Some of my worst sunburns were during cloudy days
I actually got sunburnt one day last July despite it having rained
It's taught me that I really can't take any chances being outdoors before noon in the summer
After that I tend to be fine however
It does not have to 6 hours but your color can and does change witH very normal wintertime exposition
A big way to tell foreigners is they arrive in summer with no tan and burn but say Finns who live year round can have a decent color by March or so and do not get red or burn from normal sun exposure
And maligning sun exposure itself is not healthy, nevermind vitamin d or other effects, it can be Fantastic for your well being to process sunlight
That was here in the North
Then again, I’m a ginger
But isn't south African and Portuguese climate similar
Well in my opinion almost all accents are disappearing slowly in Portugal and becoming more and more like the standard one which is a shame
I feel like younger people are speaking with less and less accent but I'm not really sure if its 100% true
Standard accent is spoken between Lisbon and Coimbra and it's used in all media radio tv etc
and it's the way I speak
I like all accents and think that they should be preserved
The funniest and seen more like low class is maybe form interior and beira alta
The Minho and Porto accents are seen more rude, and posh one maybe from cascais idk if everyone speaks like that there but it's really annoying
I also want to know your opinion since you are also Portuguese
Depends, some make fun about each other, for example if you from the north or the archipelagos or other places and go to Lisbon, they make fun of you, specially if you're a kid at highschool for example, they look at you like an outsider because they (from Lisbon) never go out from that region
Even there you have a lot of misconceptions about the North and vice versa and because of that sometimes people are seen has stupid
On TV usually in every point you got a "south wash" actors that are from the North and other regions with an accent usually have to "forget" the accent for acting things or for the news or stuff like that because having a different accent is like being lower class
But little by little things are changing, but still have the tendency to uniformize the language
I think there isn't much of a posh accent
I think our islands deserve a mention, they are incredibly hard to understand, and even each island within the same archipelago has its own accent, with the S.Miguel one probably the hardest to understand
Beiras is probably looked down upon the most
Our south has some nice ones too
Lisbon people insist they don't have an accent, but while it isn't as obvious as the northern one it's definitely there (like Lesboa instead of Lisboa)
I think the beiras accent is slowly disappearing as people from the interior move to study
Accents vary across the Minho, though I personally can't tell them apart
I went to university in Covilhã and everyone asked if I was from Famalicão because of my accent
I didn't even know Famalicão had an accent
Anyway, I'm from Braga
I'm from Cascais, the accent is a meme in the sense that there's barely anyone that talks like that
We have the typical Lisbon accent
I only met 1 person in my life that has the stereotypical Cascais valley girl accent
It's mostly played up for laughs or by those "tias" on tv for attention
In fact it's so rare, that when I met that lady for the first time I did a double take because I thought she was trolling me
You know what's not rare
People making a shitty impression of a Cascais accent when they met someone from Cascais
I laugh everytime (not really)
I agree with you in everything
Not at all
I've done it many times in the past and never got any weird looks or comments
It's not uncommon to see people eating alone at restaurants here
Yeah
Its pretty common to see business people, lawyers, construction workers (everyone basically) eating alone in their lunch break
Yes, eating could be considered a social activity, but just because you’re sitting alone in a table at a tasca/restaurante doesnt mean you’re “alone”. People here talk a lot to other costumers, but specially to the waiters
And even more if its a place you go everyday/often
Hmmm I love tascas
Nope, it would be highly illegal especially at Constitutional and penal level
It doesn't surprise me you guys still have it
Bounty hunters
What
That's something I thought only existed in fiction
You Americans and your strange shit
Back when Portugal was a dictatorship and very poor, people used to starve and seldom have access to proper meat
So they would come up with creative ways of cooking leftovers
So there's things like eating fish eyes, lamb's brain, animals intestines, etc
Another example is "Roupa Velha", which is a kind of soup made with leftover veggies from another meal
"Tired horse soup", or sopas de cavalo cansado in Portuguese
A soup made of red wine (tinto), pieces of bread (broa), and sugar that poor people, including children would eat to keep them warm, especially in the cold winters and also to give them an energy boost for the work day
Used to be common back then
All anyone eats north of the Alps is meat, cabbage and potato
I've only ever heard of "roupa velha"/"farrapo velho" as a new dish using Christmas' leftovers (with the codfish meal, not the meat meals)
This makes me want to try it
Really great to guarantee your child’s cognitive functions are permanently limited
Yes
You're right
I meant that soup made with Cozido à Portuguesa leftovers
That's not called Roupa Velha
My bad
But the intention is the same
By reading some of the comments I think the term "Roupa Velha" (old clothes) is a kind of common umbrella Iberian name for "a dish made with what's left". People do it differently; the essence is that it is a dish intended on not throwing food away
Latino countries probably inherited the concept
I eat it quite often actually
Bacalhau com Natas, Pastéis de Bacalhau and Boiled with potatoes most often
I guess it depends from person to person
Some people eat more fish than others, and those, like me, that eat plenty of fish usually go for Bacalhau(cod) because it can be better preserved and cooked in multiple ways
The other fish lose a lot of their quality if they are not consumed the day they were caught
So cod fish is more like a convenience, I guess, that's why's so popular
Edit: another advantage of cod fish meals is that they can be stored as leftovers or stored to eat later, even cold
Kinda like tuna actually
For me it's something I have every so often, usually in a family gathering or lunch/dinner with friends
I recomend looking into r/Portugal for better answers about bacalhau
16 cultural 1 natutal
15 with photos and location
We have 17 sites and 19 sites expecting classification
Here's the list
Open list of sites
A while back in /r/portugal people were posting [francesinhas] they'd come across in different places and thus there were debates on what exactly counts as a proper francesinha
I think all can agree that the best ones you can only get in Porto
There was a similar trend of people posting pics of pasteis de nata that they'd come across in different countries, but that was more to do with the sacrilege and how wrong they were making them
There's also the [Super Bock] vs [Sagres] debate, but I and most people I know prefer Super Bock
Speaking of which there's also the debate between *Imperial* and *Fino*, both names used to describe [this] Whatever you call it usually depends on what part of the country you're from
What we call to a portuguese pint [Fino vs
Imperial ]
It's clearly fino and everyone who says the contrary is a heathen
(the quantity of it isn't actually a pint, not using the word pint to measure quantify)
Two main discussions: I will present the issue and then give my opinion on the topic
1st) when you drink milk with cereals what do you put first, cereals or milk
In my opinion, we should put the milk first mainly if you want to put it in the microwave first, but there are many people who put cereals first
2nd) should we put pinneaple on pizza
This is kind of an international issue and I think most of portuguese people are against it
Pizza is a meal, pinneaple is a fruit that you may eat as a dessert
Pizza is good, pinneaple is good, both together are shit
If it makes you feel good, we call it Panike - which i have no idea where it comes from buuut its a larger and delicious version of pain au chocolat/chocolatine
Also, it can have egg cream filling instead of chocolate
Ok, first of all, everyone knows the best francesinha is in Taberna Belga in Braga
Secondly, the North stays strong with fino all the way
A melhor Francesinha é a do Capa Negra no Porto
e Super Bock >>>>
Quanto ao imperial vs fino, imperial é dos lisboetas, que chamam ténis a sapatilhas, chapéus de sol a guarda-sol, bica a café (cimbalino
), cadeados a aloquetes, cabide a cruzeta, etc etc
resposta correta: fino, claro está!
Idk what either one of them is but, for us is codfish all the way
PS: sorry for consuming so much codfish, it's an addiction at this point
It's a bit confusing for someone (starting) learning greek and loving gyros
No wonder you guys have so many civil wars
You can find Super Bock in some British supermarkets
And pasteis de nata can be found in some coffee shops like Costa's!
My bad, have only been to Braga twice and haven't had a francesinha there
Will keep a note of it
Vou acrescentar à lista de francesinhas que tenho de provar ;)
Cá na minha região também chamamos uma cerveja imperial, mas de resto não usamos muitos nomes/termos lisboetas
Não consigo chamar carcaça a um papo-seco
Excuse me, did you just put peppers in salada russa
Hahahah não me lembrava da carcaça! xD
It's already in the same in both Portuguese and English, so i wouldn't change anything
Not a lot of countries have the same name in english vs native language
So, we cool
Fun fact: that name root is the same for Wallonia - the french speaking part of Belgium - which us the old germanic word “walls” meaning, as you’ve pointed out, “foreigners”.
I think there are other regions in Europe with similar names in english and german, but I can’t remember them right now
P.S. how do you read cymru
Is is like “Kumru”? It sounds badass but I’m not sure I say it right
Funnily enough "Peru" is what we call a turkey in Portuguese
In Portuguese we call Latvia "Letónia", which honestly I think makes it easier to mix you up with Lithuania
Here, Portugalia is the name of a restaurant chain and the name of an Airline xD
Edit: words
A bit for me, "galia" makes me remember "Gaul", which was France at a certain point, but still derives from Celtic, so
Changing it to Poortugahl wouldn't help our name
&#x200B;
Lusitânia would be cool though, but they don't know how to pronounce the nasal sound and the word is from way before the kingdom started
You can just force people and release a hit song about it
Sweetzen because of swiss chocolate
Going for the Côte d'Ivoire approach, I see
England means "land of the Angles", an old Germanic tribe
It's kind of different, Angles united with Saxons who were a majority, they only started being english after the kingdom was established, and they are more descendant from saxons than angles
(at least that is what I remember from history)
I like a lot of Japanese names, but I obviously could never name a kid of mine that
I don't plan on having kids anyway, so it doesn't matter
I've always loved the names Jason and Cian
I think Ragnar sounds pretty cool
Pelo amor de Deus, não chames Naruto ao puto
Carlos' pretty popular here in Portugal
That's basically the entire population of Portugal
My parents let me choose my little brother's name, I picked Luís Miguel
Não seria Naruto
Nem gosto de Naruto sequer
Ou Son Goku
Não houve um gajo que chamou isso ao filho
Fez até uma espécie de petição no Facebook na altura, acho
Credo
Espero que não tenham deixado
Pobre miúdo
Se queres que te diga não sei como acabou a história
Mas espero que tenham rejeitado esse nome no registo
Pelo que me lembro ele conseguiu registrar porque a mulher era brasileira ou algo do género
O nome do puto foi Son Goku da Silva
So here the opinion is that Normally big brands sell those cheaper as normally they have less quality and are giant billboards, So it's considered tacky where I'm from, and I'd never go outside with that type of shirt
In my school they'd use to make fun of people that would wear that type of thing too
In the UK it feels a bit more acceptable but still you don't see it that often
In the rest of South Europe in my experience it's rare
I feel that you can maybe see it slightly more in Italy and they're more accepted here as people are more fashion/brand oriented then in other countries I've lived in, but you still don't see them much
Ps: I'm taking about the ones with gigantic logo on them, not the ones with a little one at the top left
And this may vary hugely based on regions
I personally don't like clothing with logos, save if the logo is very very small, because then you're just a walking advertisement
But yeah, that's absolute BS, Europeans wear clothing with logos, we get the same shirts from third world sweat shops that Americans do
I think these days they're not really in vogue
I don't really like them apart from athleisure (because most of the time they're kept small)
But I remember during the mid-2000s I only wore graphic tees and clothing with logos
Not sure if this is still the case, but I remember white Levi t-shirts were worn by everyone during the summer
Never really understood why
I think his friend probably meant how big and visible the logos are, I used to wear American streetwear when I was younger and those tend to have huge logos specially t-shirts and while most clothing in Europe does have visible logos they normally are small
Most t-shirts from brands like Elements and Hurley have huge logos stamped on them
The United Kingdom
Growing up, british culture was just everywhere and it was great
Great comedies, great musicians
Great looking cities
I even went there in 2009 and loved it
But ever since then Britain has done a beautiful job at making it look like a shithole
Crime rates rising to all hell
Ridiculous free speech restrictions
I always knew the weather was shit but everything else ruined the country for me
Plus I had 2 of my friends go live there for 2-3 years and they both came back despite making much more money there, they came back depressed and soulless
This has nothing to do with brexit
I had this view way before brexit, and tbh, whilst I'm not against the EU I feel like brexit was a good wake up call
When I was a kid I assumed Italy was full of crazy ferrari drivers and tasty pizza
Then I finally went to Italy when I was 12
and it was nothing like that
I grew up watching a lot of 80's and 90's tv shows and movies and the UK was always depicted with weird sounding people who are nice or drunk, great sounding cars, great wits and the country fields and villages reminiscing of a harsher but simpler time
Also, funny looking bobbies and Thatcher Thatcher Milk Snatcher
Now
It's a messed up place with messed up people with messed up laws and ideas that should not be
I have kind of a romantic view on your country
Please don't let me down
Thank you for loving our language
You are asking a very general question here
At least in Portugal there are multiple origins of surnames
I have some experience in genealogy, and the surnames in Portugal have only become "stable" in the second half of the XIX  century
You have multiple origins:
* like in the Slavic and Scandinavian countries you have patronymics, like Rodrigues (son of Rodrigo), Gonçalves (son of Gonçalo), Pires (which originally was Peres i.e. son of Pedro), etc ... However these are old patronymics, that have been running for at least a century and a half
* You have place names like Gouveia, Almeida
Which posh people generally add the "de" before (or extra posh " d' ")  (like the Dutch "van" or the German "von")
* You have nicknames that became surnames, especially (but not exclusively) in the south of Portugal, like Ganhão, Ortigão
* Professions like Ferreira (from Ferreiro=blacksmith)
* Plant names like Oliveira, Figueira, Pereira
* Animal names like Leitão, Coelho, Cordeiro
* Religious related names like Assis, Santos  (dos Santos (meaning "from the angels") generally means that there was an orphan abandoned and taken by the church, like the Italian Esposito in the Naples region)
There are obviously thousands more, if you are more specific in your request I can give you a hand coming up with a Portuguese sounding name
That isn't very common in the portuguese language, sure the are do/dos/das between the first and middle name that mean "of" but it's very rare
"d'" if you live in Cascais, "de" if you're rich, and "do/da" if you're poor
:')
EDIT: What about names with colours, like Branco or Roxo
Those are also somewhat common
I need to do my family tree and find out who was an orphan
I sense some dark past but at the same time I feel like it was common at the time
I was scrooling down looking for these
ahah I was thinking The same
my Mother has a cousin who os a Damous lawyer and he added a t to is name, double t now, much more relevant
I'm from Cascais and I don't have a "d'" or even a "de". People from Cascais have a bad reputation because of a small crowd, that really aren't from Cascais
Unfortunately it  was very common
On my research I've found several cases on my family tree
One of which as a son of an unknown mother, i.e. the father was known but the mother was unknown, which sounds a little confusing, The matter was that they weren't married, and didn't live together
Later on, via an older cousin, that had received from her grandmother which was the grand-daughter of the "unknown" lady, I was able to find her name
But even worse is reading the parish death records, there are times where all the records on both pages are of children
My parents share the same surname and since over here it's customary to name the child with the last surname from each parent, they deemed it ok to name me Surname e (and) Surname
The only thing that's annoying about it is the expectation that you're supposed to know the language
Doesn't apply to me, but I have seen people get annoyed when someone doesn't speak English
It's why I find it amusing to see countries like Japan not give a fuck about English and force people to actually put some effort in trying to communicate when they travel there
It can also be annoying to see signs and whatnot only in English
Agai,n I personally don't have a problem with this (in terms of understanding what's written that is), but it excludes people who don't know the language
At least English is a relatively simple language to grasp
It has several inconsistencies, but at least there aren't a hundred different ways to conjugate a verb
Yes, because they fucking pulled the pink map on us
No, not at all
Well yes and no
It depends, but in general its not annoying or bad per say
The benefits are obviously the simplicity and easy learning of the language are great, a lot situations are more easy to deal
No offence intended to the following, but for example French has a lot of speakers but when it comes to learn it, it's a nightmare at least from my perspective has a non native French speaker, in school i barely learn the language because it was hard (I'm also dyslexic but in comparison English was extremely easy to learn and become fluent)
My language, Portuguese is also hard to learn, but not has hard in comparison to French
I would like to see my own language become more popular yes, because Portuguese is spoken by a lot of people around the world and Portuguese is a beautiful language (not biased at all /s  xP)
English anyone's me when certain words that already exist in Portuguese start to be replaced by English terms, it becomes really annoying, if the term already exists in our language why bring a English term when we already have that word, its total understandable if the term or word doesn't exist in our language and use an English term that everyone or almost everyone knows has a fix for the lack of a term but why use it when we already have the bloody word
This is the only major thing that annoying about English
Sorry to the French, no offence is intended to your language but bloody hell it's really hard xP again sorry
This is honestly the best comment in this thread
The English native speakers privilege is a very real thing and most people aren't even aware of that
We shall speak British English by the order of the peaky fookin blinders
I fully understand you
As a Portuguese it's sad to see the dominance of Brazilian Portuguese, the worst is using the Brazilian flag when referring to Portuguese, at least use Brazilian Portuguese and the flag
But it's completely normal
Might just be the types of tourists that travel to my region, but I've definitely witnessed it
It doesn't happen all the time, but it does happen
Use it wisely my friend
Nowadays no, and unless they get a new crazy dictator somehow in the future, I think we're pretty good
well, other than when it comes to football, I think Spain and Portugal are pretty good
Well Spain didn't invade us for about 400 years, so I think we're good
They have their own problems to care about and I think Portugal isn't one of them
Edit: I admit I'm just here to read about the balcans
Spain, we good
Otherwise, only need to worry about sea-level rise
Depends on which ideology or kings are reigning there
I mean we also have Azores and Madeira that Wikileaks confirmed that USA (Nixon IIRC) wanted to take it from us
We never knew this until now
What would it happen if Trump tried to take lets say Ibiza from Spain, Azores from Portugal or Greenland from Denmark
Don't worry, we will just call the Baker woman of Aljubarrota, she is basically the doom slayer
"Rip and tear every Spaniards until its done
" ~ Baker woman of Aljubarrota probably
Fellow Portuguese stop looking at how others live their lifes and what they have a go get it for yourself, we are better than we think we are
Hey, at least you're not in the same group as Germany and France, you're saved from that embarrassment that Portugal is probably going to feel
Our accent is terrible but most young people can hold conversations in English and older people, despite not having any education in English whatsoever, can understand a word here or there
I think that has a lot to do with movies, since there is a bigger exposure to English, it becomes easier to learn if you want it
But don't forget, Portuguese is not only spoken in Portugal
It is a big language indeed
I know some things about Morocco from history classes, and a bit about Carthage too
But other than that, not that much
I spent two weeks in Tunisia in the 90s. I remember it being beautiful, and tourist friendly
There were beautiful beaches with warm water and white sand, some well preserved monuments and museums
The people was friendly
Because I stayed some time I got to travel to the edge of the Sahara, stay the night at an oasis and spend the dawn in desert the dunes
Even by the standards of my poor south European country they were poor
Everything is to be haggled in Morocco and offering to trade a woman for camels is a gag they run on tourists
I don't much else, which is a shame since Morocco is the 3rd closes country to Portugal
Them's fighting words, buddy

Has the movie "Home Alone" accidentally become a Christmas tradition in your country
Alternatively,  or if not, what other pieces of media  does everyone experiences every year
I perfer watching die hard around Christmas, at least personal tradition
Does anyone else have the same here
Home alone and love actually are always on TV around x-mas times
Yes, and lord of the rings on New Year’s Eve
Harry Potter and The Lord Of The Rings
At least where I live, back In the 90s and early 2000s every year we saw it on tv an we were like "God damn it
Not home alone again
But now we embrace it has a tradition
This year it's on as usual and  everyone is watching it because it became a nostalgic thing we do on Christmas
Beethoven used to be very popular too,  but then it just stopped
I cant remember the last time I saw it
Literally the same thing here in Portugal
Labregos
Azeiteiros
In Porto: Gunas
In Lisbon: Xungas
Portugal has alentejanos
In the Netherlands we used to call them "Asos" as well, but this was back in the 90's.
Azeiteiros tb é uma boa descrição
Ruras também
Não me ofendas crl que eu faço azeite, ó seu azeiteiro
Ou então labregos azeiteiros do caralho que não metem pisca e deitam restos de comida pela janela
Bónus: pessoal que deita o saco do lixo pela janela (num prédio)
e os gunas
Não?
Yes, in Portugal we have/use the word "chunga" and "chungaria", which pretty much means "worthless"
nunca vi deitarem sacos do lixo pela janela, felizmente, mas sim, seria coisa de azeiteiro
Isto é discutível mas não é o grupo que é olhado com mais sobranceria pelo resto da população os "avecs"? Esses em geral são os mais azeiteiros dos labregos
Deitar seria jogar o saco de lixo pela janela
Sim, exatamente
Even with the rock starting to come, probably Light Music was really popular in the 70's since the dictatorial regime supported it to go to Eurovision Song Contest because the lyrics in general had the requirements needed to never using censorship, even if people used metaphors to describe situations that happened that time
What marks the end of dictatorship, still on the Light Music was ["Depois do Adeus" performed by Paulo de Carvalho and written by José Calvário] that went once again to ESC
On the same period marked "Música de Intervenção" translated is Intervention Music that were music about the end of the dictatorial regime and one of the ones who marked it was ["Grândola Vila Morena" by Zeca Afonso (Zeca is a common nickname for José)] and if you hear it uses a traditional type of music called Cante Alentejano, that was recently considered Unesco Immaterial Heritage
After that, at the end of the 70's beginning 80's started rock strongly with [Xutos e Pontapés] [GNR] or [Heróis do Mar]
What marked the 80's too was [Amália Rodrigues' Fado]
Another ones you can hear from this time period [Madredeus] and [António Variações]
>at the end of the 70's beginning 80's started rock strongly with Xutos e Pontapés, GNR or Heróis do Mar
While great representatives of Portuguese Rock of that time, not mentioning Rui Veloso, [UHF] or [Taxi] who were probably the first artists to appear is a sin
;) The song ["Chico Fininho"] by Rui Veloso, is even considered the song that inaugurated that period
>What marked the 80's too was Amália Rodrigues' Fado
Maybe I've been all my life wrong, but I was completely under the impression that fado was pretty much shunned in the 80's and 90's because of its connection to the dictatorship (not that the songs or the artists were themselves apologists of it, but the genre itself was heavily promoted by the regime)
Fado has only been revived in the early 2000's with the new generations, headed by [Mariza]
Madredeus is more 90's than 80's, but still a great band nonetheless, if you're into their style
[António Variações] is indeed from the 80's and not known enough internationally
**EDIT:** Just to add [this amazing song] from the 70's Intervention music period, by Sérgio Godinho
Thank you for adding more, I named just a few
True, you know that some artists made albums out of the country, generally at France to then come back and sell them undercover
That's funny :)
Never heared that band btw but thank you for your recommendation :)
[Here an archive of Petrus Castrus] in fact they're from the 70's
If you're interested in Portuguese prog rock you have to check out José Cid's 1978 album "10 000 anos depois entre Vénus e Marte" - [ \- imo the best portuguese album of all time
I think only after the dictatorship went down, because all music had to be inspected to see if had some stuff that weren't aloud to have in music, but I'm not sure
I'm sure at the 80's started to enter more and some made teenage and adult memories of a lot of people
A fun fact:
Did you know that Carmen Miranda was portuguese
She went to Brazil when she was 10 months old
More fado singers I can name and remember is Carlos do Carmo, Celeste Rodrigues (sister of Amália), Camané, Ana Moura, Carminho (appeared on Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations), Cuca Roseta, Cristina Branco, Gisela João, Katia Guerreiro, Raquel Tavares, Dulce Pontes, Mafalda Arnauth and more
Some of the ones that I send you don't sing exclusively fado, but great part of them do
If someone remembers more, comment :)
You're welcome, it's great to see other people interested in Portuguese music
I while ago, I compiled [a short YouTube playlist] of songs from that 80's rock period
It's obviously very incomplete, but I feel it's a good way to get a sense of what mainstream Portuguese rock was during the 80's (the whole period is even called the "Portuguese Rock Boom", due to how it exploded in popularity and new bands were popping up every day)
You're welcome mate
It's my pleasure, man
Of the playlist
It's linked in my post, but I'll put here again:
Hard to break it down into percentages but I'll try:
Brazilian
Written: About 98%
Spoken: 99-100%
Spanish
Written: About 70-80%
Spoken: About 50%
Italian
Written: About 50% at best
Spoken: About 30% at best
French
Written: About 25% at best
Spoken: About 20% at best
Romanian
Written: Like 10%
Spoken: Nearly nothing
I can understand spoken Spanish and Galician pretty well 90~% of the time, same with the written forms, although Galician is the easiest since both Portuguese and Galician shared a common language in their roots (Galician-Portuguese)
I understand Italian most of the time when spoken and written although easy is not has easy has the previous languages
French is complicated i can understand a few things from them when spoken, written depends honestly
Romanian i never heard so i can't judge on that, written I'm not sure if i ever saw it, i assume that's a bit more difficult than Italian and easier than French
Spanish have some difficulties understanding us spoke, since Portuguese has more fonectic sounds and we stress vouls in quick manner
I think they have no problem with written
Se quiserem responder nas vossas línguas para ver quão fácil ou difícil é eu aceito o desafio, a menos que não queiram aí podemos falar inglês. A quem a primeira língua não é uma língua das línguas romance mas aprendeu uma gostava de ouvir a vossa opinião na matéria (to whom the first language is not from the romance family but you learn one, i want to hear your opinion on the mater)
I understand Spanish, Catalan, and some Italian and French, I don't understand Romanian at all
As someone who speaks some German I can recognise some Danish/Swedish/Norwegian vocabulary, and ofc my English knowledge helps somewhat too
But no way I can understand full sentences or read articles in those languages
As someone who learns German on their own, I promise you that knowing English helps
Ofc there's no mutual intelligibility between both languages, but it gives you an advantage
Not just in basic vocabulary but also in certain grammatical features as well
Hungarian is probably as similar to Estonian as Portuguese is to German
> So Spanish and French, nothing, i understand a few words hear and there
Portugese i catch more words the the other 2
That's interesting
We're always put in the "can't understand what they say" bin
Listening to Aromanian is also gibberish to me
I wonder why you'd get more Portuguese words than Spanish, though
Is it our slavic-like cadence that's more familiar to you
Online I often see Spanish speakers claiming that Italian is the closest language to Spanish
Either they have never seen Portuguese or the spoken form is too hard for them to understand
And weirder than that is when I see people saying that French is the closest language to Spanish
Brazilian is not a language
Whenever i hear Romanian the only words i can pick up are "Eu" and "Sunt"
How can you understand written Spanish at 50% but Portuguese less than 20%? Don't both languages share like 80% of their vocabulary
That was the point I was trying to make with my analogy
Fire
Either during the Inquisition or currently during wildfires
I don't remember any special way of doing it
During the first republic bombing our politicians
Dictatorship, we would send them to the "fryer" Tarrafal
After the 1974 revolution, we are more polite, exception for the 80s and FP25
Burning at the stake
Ok so Portugal was one of the first countries to abolish the death penalty in Europe, but when the death penalty was allowed the perfer method or the only method used was hanging in terms of the Portuguese law apply by national courts
Now in terms of church courts/inquisition, and the application of the canonical law, applied in Portugal, the perfer method would have probably been the application of torture devices like the jaw breaker, the weele
Etilic Overdose from all the wine
Oh vá lá! Tadinhas das pessoas
Ainda bem que estamos a ter menos incêndios, mas
We did kill a few people during the Inquisition,  mainly by burning them alive
Não estou a gozar com elas, mas antes a ironizar com a horrível situação.
Also the jaw breaker and the weele killed a lot of people
Eu percebi
Também estava só a fazer uma piada com a maneira como construíste a frase
Well, the Portuguese have ease in understanding other Romantic Languages (except French), so in the University you can find foreign Professors lecturing in a sort of Spanish or Italian mixed with some Portuguese vocabulary, and it's ok
It gives excuse for laughs, especially when they say curse words or are overly informal without realising
For English, it depends on the context
Some Professors usually ask: "Are there any students who don't understand Portuguese and prefer English
". This only happens in University
Nope we're pretty stable on that regard
In Portugal, there is the FLA (Frente da Libertação Açoreana) that aims to claim the independence of the azorean islands over continental Portugal
Idk I think they're kinda dumb
I wounder, other than Catalunha, does Galiza have any such movement
(if they do, give us our number, we will welcome them as honorary Portuguese /s (kidding) )
Didn't that movement died out or was unpopular
(genuinely asking, i don't know much about it)
There was also FLAMA, in Madeira, back in the seventies
They had a bombing campaign, and ended when one of the bombs actually killed someone
[Actually
Me, as someone who's family is half catalan, and want independence, believe that catalonia should be independent
They have their own language, their own culture, their own government, their own police, their own economy, wich would be bigger and better if they didn't divide it with Spain
So I would like your opinion on why Catalonia should/shouldn't be independent
[Actually
Oldest consistent boarders (for a European country that's really impressive taking to account the history of the continent) , although there's a controversy with Olivença with Spain
Its complicated but here's a Wikipedia article
It's almost a joke by now, only really old people support it, so it'll disappear in a few years
There is also the prince of Pontinha, who is literally the most active separatist movement in Portugal
Certainly has more media words written about him in the last couple decades
OTOH it is is one man and about 50, 100 square meters of a rock
OLIVENÇA É NOSSA
Weren't they monarchist right wingers or something
>it's pretty stupid, in this day and age, to go around creating new borders and amplifying our differences instead of getting together and cooperate
So and what about Spain joining Portugal under the Portuguese government, would you like that
>all aspects of Catalonian culture are respected and promoted nowadays
Are you sure
The Catalans voted for Carles Puigdemont and he was forced to step down, and that is happening again with Quim Torra, but he is refusing to step down, isn't that oppression
And image if France annexed Spain, would you like to pay taxes to them
Spain annexed Catalonia, Catalonia off course doesn't want to pay anything to they invaders and oppressors, that is a logical though, and I for sure know that a lot of Catalans think that way, including the example of my family
I live on Flores
There's a few old guys in my village that still support this but it's not exactly a hot topic
If they get drunk enough then they might rant about it late night
They're definitely right wing but I've never heard them mention the monarchy
I did a bit of research they aren't monarchsit (idk where I got that idea, might have had confuse some elements of another thing with them, my bad)
So do you think it's something that will eventually die out with the older generations
>Spain is de facto a federal state
The kingdom of Catalonia and Aragon was annexed in the 15th century and has been struggling for independence since, in a federal state, all of the provinces/states in majority agree to be together
Not the case of Catalonia, where the majority wants independence
>He was forced to step down because he made illegal things
Name them
He only did a referendum to see what the people want, and the Spanish civil guard attacked civilians, why aren't they being charged
>Spain did not annex Catalonia
The Crowns of Castile and Aragon entered a personal union and, over time, merged into the same country, called Spain, that has gone through a lot of different governments and ideology
Personal union is annexation, call it what you want
And the interesting part is that through out the different governments and ideologies Catalonia always wanted to be independent, off course specially in the Franco period, where the Catalans were slightly more oppressed than nowadays, btw my grandfather fought on the Spanish civil war on the 2nd republic of Spain side
Acho que sim
>So, he used public resources to do something that was outside its competences
He used Catalan resources to show something most Catalans wanted to be shown, he only made what the  people wanted
>PDC, which seems to be willing to throw the rest of us under the proverbial fascist bus if it befits them
ERC is showing that at least they care about the bigger picture and for that they have my respect
On that I can agree, but note that ERC has much more influence, I don't think PDC is that bad but my ideology indeed identifies more to ERC, which was founded by Lluís Companys, the greatest independent leader of all time
>you can't ignore them just because you feel that more or less the majority of the population wants something
But isn't that, the will of the people the whole point of democracy
Can't laws change
>change the Statute of Autonomy
You mean downgrade it right
Because I really doubt that they can upgrade it
Well, the word "canto" in Portugal could mean a corner or a something singing :v
Security + Safety = Segurança (in portuguese)
We use the word **chão** for *floor* and *ground*
Answering your question the other way around: *levar, tomar, tirar*= to take
In portuguese that doesn't happen very frequently
It more the opposite
Bank and stool/bench
So we have the word banco which dependen on the context can either be a Bank or stool/bench
Eu fui ao Banco
(i went to the bank)
Eu sentei me no banco de jardim (i sat on the guardian bench)
Exactly the same in Portuguese
Same in Portugal
Same with "Banco" either a bank or bench
Oh true :oo
Forgot about that one
Region-city-country
In Portugal you have different regions and with that different traditions and even different ways of living as I have moved around I always mention even with foreign people first my region but I know a few people that do this, most of the people I know identify more city- country
For me it usually goes "City/Region, Country, Southern Europe". When I'm in my Region or city there's usually no need to say I'm from there because people usually get it, from the way I speak and the way I behave in general
But in the capital I'll always present myself as "Algarvio", or just by saying the city I'm from
Overseas I'll say I'm portuguese, and if someone is confused by that (happens more often than one would think), I'll clarify that I'm southern european
I'd say I identify more with my city, as there are more people with lives similar to mine (at least financially I guess)
Same here, Lisbon, Portugal, South Europe and then Europe
I feel alot closer to Italians and Greeks than say Finnish or Slovenians though
I would say it depends on the city or region
If you're from a big city (Lisbon, Porto, Coimbra, etc
) or from the central regions, you're most likely to identify with your city first
If, however, you are from a more traditionally present region (Algarve, Alentejo, Trás-os-Montes, Azores, Madeira, for example) you are more likely to identify with your region
My theory is that, because throughout history, the center of the country has never had a constant regional division, people identity more with their cities
However, elsewhere, regional divisions have more or less stayed the same for centuries, so people are more likely to have a regional identity
I completely agree I would never identify with a region always country and city
Regions in Portugal are a complete mess, if you asked me what was my region I wouldn't know what are you talking about
The historic regions, the districts, the new nuts 2 or nuts 3 regions
If you divide Portugal into regions it would be North, center, Lisbon and Tagus Valley, Alentejo, Algarve, Azores and Madeira
I was thinking more about nut 2, but I see that it can be a bias on my part as I’m from Algarve which for me is one of the regions as the previous comment mentions has kept its identify throughout centuries and for people from Centro that may not be as true for example
Well in school I played a lot with my friends
We'd play the usual games: tag, hide and seek, cops and robbers, etc
plus games we came up with ourselves
At home I'd watch television and would play video games
My dad's always been super into computers and gadgets and so I played a lot of old skool emulators, PS1 and Dreamcast
Had a Game Boy Colour as well
Later I'd get a PS2 and that was probably my most played console as a kid, along with the DS
I was introduced to video games from a very early age and to this day I'm super into them
Not just playing them but their history and how they were developed
Growing neither me or my friends lived in a town, rather we lived in a common geographic area
Our houses weren't walking distance to each other, and so we didn't really meet up in the weekends unless our parents planned a playdate
So as a child I spent a lot of my weekends with my sister at my grandparents' place whilst my parents worked
It was kind of boring there so we were stuck watching the four default Portuguese channels, though at some point I managed to convince my grandparents to let me bring my consoles
Summer holidays were also like that for the most part, but my fondest memories are of the times my parents would send me to "summer camp" where I could actually interact with other children
Also played Tennis for a while
Words that start with an H because in Portuguese H doesn't have a sound so I don't pronounce them I only noticed this when moved to the UK and people told me I was saying "eye school" instead of "high school"
Any word with the "th" sound is particularly hard for me because we don't have anything close to that sound in Portuguese
It's especially tough when sometimes "th" has that sound and sometimes it's another sound entirely, so I always end up guessing
"Squirrel" is a classic, but I struggle many times with the number "three"
I speak Portuguese as first language and those below arw the worst for me:
Beach vs bitch
Sheet vs shit
[Rural, 1:08]
Also: Category
Same here
Going back and forth between s and th is tricky
I can say "something" pretty well, but not "something simple". "something else" has enough of a gap that it's alright again
Maybe because it doesn't exist in Portuguese
Maybe Spaniards don't have that trouble
I really don't see the trouble in that "Sally sells seashells by the seashore", probably because Portuguese is full of s's and sh's.
Soft 'Th' as in "They" or hard 'Th' as in "Think"?
If “queue” is hard, wait until you need to remember how to pronounce “quay”.
Portuguese: Esquilo
That's funny, because in Portugal, some of us do the opposite with the letter D. For example, I want to pronounce the word "Load", but I end up pronouncing it "Loathe".
In that situation, it must be either challenging or funny when someone talks with a lisp and " *ftartf talking like viff* " ahah
It's a Hard Th
Even though I had to think for a second about this one, because it's kind of usual to pronounce it soft, it's supposed to be a hard Th
José Mourinho does that too when he says "I Sink", and many portuguese people make fun of him because we believe it's not that hard to pronounce it
Like, pronouncing the letter S, but pretending to have a lisp, automatically makes it a hard "Th".
I guess all mediterranean countries feel a bit like us due to weather and food
However when I visited australia the weather and surf/beach feeling really made me feel at home
Can't wait to return to Croatia
In some ways, I felt at home
Love from Portugal
I've never been to Serbia, but when I listen to Serbian ballads I feel like I'm listening to a type of fado
Serbian ballads are definitely the most "fado" like type of music I've ever found until now
I mean: what is [this] The instrumental, the use of the voices, the way they deliver the lyrics
Or [this] I feel like Mariza could sing this
Now I just remembered that Belarus even tried to send a song about potatoes to Eurovision two years ago
Not exactly near, but I would say the "[Portas de Almourão] where the [Ocreza river] breaks an important geological fault line
You can appreciate the power water erosion there, and how the river managed to open a "door" in the mountains
Given that geologically this was a region that had gold, you can also find archeological evidence near the river of Roman and Medieval gold extraction
Most likely [this] waterfall (called [Pulo do Lobo] As a whole for the region, maybe the [cork tree forests] where the black iberian pigs roam free
I live now close to this [unice cave] Here, in the Algarve region, you can find a lot of unice landscape anomalies like:
- [Arco de Albandeira]
- [Praia da Marinha
A cliff with a unice schape]
- [Algar seco with this natural pool]
- [Praia da Falésia with this orange tone cliffs]
The pictures of the website don't do it justice, it is a very impressive landscape once you are there
Unfortunately the Portuguese craze for planting eucalyptus trees and the yearly forest fires (which are in no way related to the eucalyptus themselves that burn like napalm) have destroyed most of the natural surrounding landscape and heavily eroded the soils
The place must have been beautiful in Roman times, when it was covered in oaks
It just means they were made by italians
That is a very long discussion with political considerations, but long story short, the paper industry is very powerful in Portugal
Eucalyptus, native of Australia, adapts well to the Portuguese climate and produces a lot of wood
An eucalyptus forest gets harvested every seven years, in some cases
This generates a lot of income for land owners, the alternative for those plots of land would either in many cases, pine trees (lower productivity and also very prone to forest fires), oak trees (which take forever to grow) or traditional olive groves (not really economically viable at today's hand labor costs), so they go with the dreaded eucalyptus
Eucalyptus have a huge environmental impact, and it is only economically viable because they don't pay the real cost
They burn like napalm, like I said, but the cost of fighting forest fires gets supported by tax payers and individuals that have their property and sometimes lives lost
They destroy the soil, which takes millennia to regenerate, but that cost will be supported by future generations
I use Microsoft Teams too
I have classes from 9:00 am to 4:15 pm every weekday
Normally I have 2 lessons per day, but I can have 5 total
My school also uses Microsoft teams, although I think the app doesn't fell finished
It has a lot of flaws
At my university we're using Zoom and Google Meet for the classes (depends on the teacher)
It ranges from 4-8 hours of classes a day, plus several assignments
I can't wait for the vacations to start
Portuguese guy here, we're having online classes through Colibri Zoom
We are using Zoom for online lessons
But we’re going to school for presential classes on the subjects we are going to make exams
Ah yes, another Portuguese
Oh boy

É vale da porca, não vale porco
Rio Cabrão pops to mind
Eu só conheço um vale porco, nem tem o "de".
Agora q meembras, quando estava a ir para arcos de valdevez acho q me lembro de passar por esse rio
Então é porque existem os dois, o que eu falei é em Trás-os-Montes
Pois, não são o mesmo sítio

Moimenta-Alcafache Train Crash
The official dead count was 49 but the estimates point to 150 dead
A regional train and and an international one crashed
The regional stoped every station and should have waited in Mangualde to wait the international train but continued on, estimating that the delay in the international's service would be enough for the regional to get to next station, where the crossing could be effected
The delay wasn't enough and the two trains collided
Only in Portugal people are so used to trains being late that they crash when on time
Wiki link for the interested
Normally they will ask/scream/affirm something about Cristiano Ronaldo
The exception was in Nowhere, Nevada, USA, where they asked me about drugs policy in Portugal
When I say I am Portuguese they always refer Cristiano Ronaldo, the sun and some vacations they did in Lisbon or Algarve
Some also talk about the cheap booze and food
Sounds accurate
"Cristiano Ronaldo"
Used to be that you'd get people saying something about Mourinho, but not as common nowadays
I hope it is joking or they are not Europeans
I made the effort to learn the Eastern countries
Is one of the best things about our country
Listen here you little блиять.
Happy Cake day
Just on our highest mountain (Serra da Estrela)
It hasn't snowed regularly for 20 years
No, but it never snows here in South Portugal
Maybe like twice in a century
Nope, in Portugal, there's only snow on the mountains and even that is fairly rare
The last time I saw snow in my city was 5 years ago, and I live in the north of Portugal
*laughs in Portuguese*
It's not like it never snows anywhere here (in fact, it did snow in our highest mountain the other day) but for most of the south of the country, it's a real event when it snows
Well, no, but I live in Southern Portugal: it pretty much never snows around here (one time in the last 35 years, I believe)
Probably either of the following:
[This one] depicts a British and a Portuguese soldiers from WW1 shaking hands
Brothers in arms, most literally
[This one] is a picture of our own filthy dictator, António de Oliveira Salazar
This particular one is very famous because it was mandatory to have one hung up on the wall of EACH AND EVERY CLASSROOM in the country
Finally, [this one] was one of the first pictures taken after the extinguishing of a massive fire that completely tore down the Grandella Warehouses, a very famous store in Lisbon
The fire ocurred in 1988
The best iteration of a Salazar picture is definitely [this one] May he rot
God bless the Revolution
25 de Abril sempre
He came to power before Hitler, actually
He was nominated as Finance Minister of the new military dictatorship (that was established after the coup d'etat of 1926) in 1929 and became head of government in 1932
Portugal was one of the first European countries to turn to the far-right, and one of the last to leave it
Yeah, people say he ran a democracy, which is not true
He simply had a political police around so if people said anything about the regime, they'd get tortured and/or arrested
Yeah, I think he had a portrait of him in his office
Haha, much obliged
After reading all these comments
*cries in portugal caralho*
Italian, it's so positive and even when they telling you to f*ck off it's better sounding then when I try to confess and immense amount of love to someone
I have to say German .. just makes my heart melt
Latin, but also German when it's sung like in opera idk it gives a grandiose feeling that's hard to describe idk, Italian idk know the language but I understand a good chuck and its both nostalgic and new and like the sound of it, Portuguese (totally not biased) but I like it and find it beautiful when it's spoken when it's sung in fado music its almost like hearing the soul of every Portuguese at once
These plebeians don't understand the quiet, understated beauty of a drunken Russian trying to neg a garbage bin
On behalf of Portugal, obrigado caralho
After having a bottle of bagaço, caralho
Thanks, shortbread is awesome
Not aware of other relevant rulers, but a few immediately come to mind:
* [Dom Henrique, Count of Portugal] \- not actually a King, he was a count and the father of the first king of Portugal
A noble man of the house of [Burgundy] born in Dijon but ethnically a German
He ruled over the county of Portugal, that latter under the rule of his son, would become the kingdom of Portugal
* [Felipe I] [II] and [III] \- all Spanish born, inbred Habsburg kings of Portugal during the period of the Iberian Union of crowns
The only Portuguese kings not eligible to the title "Dom" before their names
* [Dom Fernando II] \- The consort king to [Dona Maria II] was a German prince of the house [Saxe-Coburg and Gotha-Koháry] Although never officially the head of state, he has very involved in the rule of the kingdom, and during his wife's pregnancies was the *de facto* ruler
After his wife passed away the title of King passed on to his son Dom Pedro V, which was still a minor, and Dom Fernando II assumed the regency for two more years
He built one of the most beautiful monuments in Portugal, the [Palacio da Pena]
First class of the 7th or 8th grade with a new French teacher and the dude casually says that Monaco is an island
That rubbed me the wrong way because I thought it wasn't, but it was a French teacher (not just french language, actually *born-in-France* teacher, with the accent and all) saying that, so I just thought I was wrong and didn't say anything
Then, one of the smartest kids in class challenged the teacher and said that Monaco wasn't an island and then chaos ensued
They started arguing, people who thought it wasn't an island but weren't sure so they wouldn't have said anything started saying so and the teacher got PISSED
He started arguing with everyone, saying we were rude and couldn't possibly know more about Monaco than him
Long story short, it was the first and last class we had with him because he resigned after that
Apparently, he had been hired on a whim because the last French teacher had resigned due to health issues just days before the start of the school year and this guy just saw accepting the position as a "favor" he was doing to someone he knew on the school board, so when he realized we would actually be a pain in the butt he resigned
I was in 8 or 9 grade when my chemistry and physics teacher tried to teach us that if you had two equal lamps in series the first would be brighter then the second (because it would "eat up" all the electricity)
My dad is an electrical engineer, I grew up making circuits for fun and he had taught me a lot of this stuff already, so I was pretty confident that what my teacher had just said was wrong
I told her this and she got mad and after a few minutes of basically screaming at me she then wrote a note to my dad saying she was the teacher and that she was right
I showed the note to my dad and explained what happened
Easy to say that he was not happy either
He then wrote a note back explaining her how it worked and why she was wrong (almost calling her dumb)
After that she didn't like me very much and I had that teacher from 7 to 12 grade
So fun
But well, it was the same teacher that usually asked us to divide some random number by 1 in the calculator "just to make sure
She wasn't very smart, but her mother used to be a teacher at the same school (and a very influential/rich family in my city) and had very good connections so her daughter was set for life there no matter how many times the students complained
Well, my 11th grade english teacher said the n-word multiple times, so that's among the dumbest things she said
What's a grammar school
I can definitely see her point
>That the Earth was thought to be flat in the Middle Ages
Wtf
The teacher is refering to a bridge, literally
So yeah he's wrong
Everyone knows since the Greek that earth is round, the Portuguese knew it, the Spanish knew it
Without that knowledge a sea voyage would be impossible to calculate and know where you are
don't know how that misconceptions even gain popularity
Portugal here (sup neighbor) it's a small thing usually here, we have children going around and singing and people give a bit of money
They'll wear paper crowns and whatnot
Not this year obviously
And you have dinner with family on the day aswell
Usually the portuguese signature dish
codfish
In my family we usually have dinner together and eat bolo rei (king cake), but I don't know about other families
Some people sing door-by-door and the owners of said houses give them some money, at least where I live
No true at all, loads of towns have holiday events and, specially small towns, people sing door to door, kinda like Halloween but you eat cake (bolo rei) and wine
[Boas Festas Boas Feeestas
“Attention, it’s cold outside !” Shows every city in the country being cold, asks people if they think it’s very cold or just regular cold
Over and over again
I liked the version they started during the Weekend lockdowns
"So, Mr
Reporter, how many people are in the main square of -Smallportuguesetown-?"
"None, Mr
Anchor"
And then keep doing that for several places during 20 minutes
Yup, also happened during New Years Eve
“Let’s go to Évora, how many people in Évora
Just police
Let’s go to Aveiro, how many people in Aveiro
None
Let’s go to Porto, one car is coming down Aliados Avenue, big news
Let’s now see how cold it is in Guarda”
Like max of 12 celsius
Like 10°C
So true, I felt bad for all the reporters who are most likely to be interns or in entry levels to be there doing ... nothing
They even sent one to a hospital that had no commotion
30 is average, 35 might get a warning just because of wildfires not for the heat itself
+40 will get a warning probably but it's not uncommon
We need winter warnings bellow 10ºC because our construction is shit so people will try to heat their houses with the most shitty heaters so along with the cold warnings we get warnings regarding possible fatal gases from these heaters, specially for older people
How's that easy, they are basically using their inexperience at the company to "pressure" them to take those slots that nobody wants
They probably even say it's an opportunity for them to show their talent
In Portugal I have to say it's the famous line of Fernando pessoa, a fucking genius of literature and poetry:
"Oh mar salgado, quanto do teu sal são lágrimas de Portugal"
"Oh salty sea, how much of your salt are tears of Portugal"
It rhymes in Portuguese and it's about the family members lost and overall sorrow and loss of sailors in the age of discoveries
I personally think Fernando Pessoa has better, deeply philosophical and absolutely incredible lines but you can't translate poetry, I tried in this comment but it fails to capture the geniality and essence of what it conveys in English
But definitely check out this alcoholic opium smoking genius with multiple personas (each with their own history, philosophical and even handwriting differences) if you speak Portuguese, it's truly mind-blowing once you get into it
Uff, that's a tough one
Portuguese people (and Brazilians too, I think) like to speak in proverbs, and metaphors and rimes
Many of these come from poems
So it's hard to say which is most popular
Many are
So a common one would be Fernando Pessoa's "Valeu a pena
Tudo vale a pena, quando a alma não é pequena
" (Was it worth it
Everything's worth it when the soul is not tiny)
I'll let others comment other examples
I think in Portugal that would be "Amor é fogo que arde sem se ver" by Camões which translates into "Love is fire that Burns without being seen", literally everyone knows it
Uff, that's a tough one

"Amor é fogo que arde sem se ver" (Love is fire that is not seen) by Camões is also very famous
Fernando Pessoa makes me proud to be Portuguese
Fernando Pessoa (still
) is a genius
He also wrote some poems in english since he lived in south africa
But i ve never read any of is english works
There's also the slogan he wrote for Coca-Cola, when he worked on an advertisement company: "Primeiro estranha-se, depois entrenha-se" (First you find it odd, then you enjoy it)
This is now a popular proverb and many people use it without realising it comes from Fernando Pessoa and what he was referring too
Pessoa is definitely the most famous poet alongside Camões, but I'd say that the most known poem is "Balada da Neve" by Augusto Gil
At least the first stanza:
Batem leve, levemente,
como quem chama por mim
Será chuva
Será gente
Gente não é, certamente
e a chuva não bate assim
Since you're Irish I have to reply a really beautiful poem also by William Butler Yeats about an Irish fighter pilot in ww1 (I think) :
An Irish airman foresees his death:
I know that I shall meet my fate
Somewhere among the clouds above;
Those that I fight I do not hate,
Those that I guard I do not love;
My country is Kiltartan Cross,
My countrymen Kiltartan’s poor,
No likely end could bring them loss
Or leave them happier than before
Nor law, nor duty bade me fight,
Nor public men, nor cheering crowds,
A lonely impulse of delight
Drove to this tumult in the clouds;
I balanced all, brought all to mind,
The years to come seemed waste of breath,
A waste of breath the years behind
In balance with this life, this death
Dante is incredible
I want to know Italian just to read Dante to be honest, my dad used to read it to me when I was younger, it's so geniously beautiful
Never read it myself, but "O Livro do Desassossego" is pretty famous abroad as well
The thing with Pessoa is that he wrote under many names and personas (which is funny given his last name), and you likely have to look for Bernardo Soares for that one
I'm sure there's more, but most of his work is poetry
Read the Book of Disquiet
It's also fairly good in English actually (Penguin Edition)
He also has some stuff originally written in English and German, I think
He was fluent in many languages
But these are not has famous or brilliant, I think
He was an anglophone, he got a British education whilst living in South Africa
There's plenty of original texts
Most poetry is in portuguese but in the last decades there has been an upswing about him outside of Portugal, you definitely will find works in German
Well, we don't appear in movies a lot
But I think the French movie [The Golden Cage] does a good job
It's a comedy about Portuguese emigrants in France who then move back to Portugal
There's also the movie [Silence] by Martin Scorsese which is about an adventure of Portuguese priests in Japan
It features some Hollywood famous people
EDIT: I've never seen Silence, but by the trailer, I think it's kind of silly the way they pronounce Portuguese names
I wonder what people from Kazakhstan think of the new Borat movie
You can hardly call The Golden Cage French
The director, which was the one that came up with the idea, is Portuguese and the majority of the actors are Portuguese
I also wouldn't say it portrays our country well at all
It is basically a cliched comedy that uses a bunch of stereotypes to make fun of the Portuguese immigrants in France that came from a poor background
I'm glad they didn't change the setting
The fact that it was still set in Sweden made it more interesting to me, because it's not something I see much of in most of the movies I watch
Not a movie, but there's a Japanese manga/anime called Shoukoku no Altair (Altair: A Record of Battles) that's very much based on the Ottoman Empire
The story takes place in a fictional world, but it has a very Turkish flavour
Of course it also looks super anime with regards to the character designs, but it's interesting nonetheless
I'd recommend the manga over the anime though
Well, it's a comedy
What are comedies without stereotypes
I don't love it, but I think it's kinda funny
Many people started suggesting this to me
I certainly will
I haven't seen it
I just knew about it and that people tough it was cool
A curious remark though: for a lot of people in the world (outside Europe), being a catholic was synonym  with being Portuguese
Even in the 20th century, you could find people in India who described themselves as "Portuguese". In fact, the catholic faith is entrenched very deep in our culture that is not merely a matter of belief and faith, but of identity
This is because Portuguese colonialism model gave much importance to conversion
In the times of the empire, there was a big debate about the rights of native people and the most important duty of teaching them about Catholicism
Well it's at least more believable than casting Brits as ancient Romans and Greeks
Also Stellan Skarsgard was in it, so that's at least one Swede
Unless they're a native speaker, don't speak Spanish
Everyone under 40 is relatively fluent in English
Don't disrespect the historical monuments
Be polite, always say "excuse me", "please", "sir/madam/miss", "good morning", "good day", "good afternoon" and "good night". We'll be deeply moved by an "Obrigado".
Don't call a POC "preto", it's considered more offensive than the N-word
Please, please, *please* don't steal the Azulejo tiles from the monuments
Many of them are hundreds of years old and irreplaceable
If you want one, please buy them from gift shops
Decriminalization =/= legalise
If You are caught smoking weed you will not be be arrested however if you posses more than the legal quantity for self use you will be arrested, you cannot sell it because the Decriminalization only protects the user and not the drug seller
And ignore the guy at terreiro do passo screaming "Axies" "cocaine", they are scammers trying to sell spices by saying that they are drugs
They are annoying to everyone not just tourists
Or toast with "This one is for the cause
I'm guessing you guys wouldn't like us Southerners very much
Whats the problem with black, grey and blue
The French disliked that
we always call it "Holanda" in Portugal, even text books use it
No one calls it "Países Baixos", or very rarely
Sorry
You should add drinking outside, I've gotten in trouble with the police for that once
Idk about england but Macron there is geting some unhappy responses
Oh no
Brazilian Portuguese is very well known here since we're so exposed to their telenovelas and songs
Hurts our pride a little bit though
Probably because both Spain and Portugal call it Holanda too
We call a Dutch person Holandês or Holandesa
It's similar to what we do with the Forcados, the objective is to tire to bull into submission and grab them by the horns
Once the bull submits, they let him go
There's no need to hurt him
Can confirm

A ida da família real para o Brasil é controversa
Uns consideram que foi uma manobra brilhante do rei João  VI para escapar ao Napoleão, outros que ele não passou de cobarde e de um traidor que fugiu dos Franceses e ficou na boa vida enquanto o povo dele era invadido por estrangeiros e morto, sendo necessária chantagem para o fazer regressar
A reliable place to buy affordable furniture
The cantine's not bad at all
The Swedish supermarket in it is a great place to by mulled wine and Daim chocolate
And the Ikea closest to me also attracts a lot of Spanish people (at least I'm assuming that's why so many go to the mall adjoining it)
In my opinion, IKEA is affordable and has good overall quality
Not a luxury brand at all but I live in Northern Portugal and very close to Porto we have a region where some of the best furniture in the world is built so we can , as I did, order some custom built furniture for a price that can almost compete with Ikea, but with a lot more quality and better materials
P.S. - I own some Ikea furniture and house wears and am happy with it
Nice place to go shopping for forniture, basically everyone goes there, also it has good food
And its a hella of a maze
Well, at least for me, it's not a place to by furniture, it's _the_ place to by furniture
We had a brand called _Moviflor_ but it went bankrupt, so, now, IKEA is the place
Let me guess, Algarve
There was also Conforama, but I have no idea whether that exists anymore
Moviflor still exists, but the quality is way worse than it used to be
Yup
There's always Spaniards there haha
Still exists
Sells crappy furniture more expensive than IKEA
Maybe because the IKEA in Portugal sells coffee with pastel de nata that cost 50 cents
I've wondered about that, because in the past that's where we used to go
Maybe it's closer for the people near the border, or maybe it is indeed cheaper
Disliking or expressing any negative comment regarding certain books, movies or characters
For some people, that immediately turns you into every -ist in the book
Captain Marvel is one of the most boring movies in the MCU, and Brie Larson's acting was wooden
In what parts did you feel that
Oh my, thank you
I feel so brave
I also found that Ghostbusters 2016 wasn't funny
Shhh
Don't tell Twitter or Tumblr, they'll say I betrayed my fellow women
Actually yeah, I thought it was fine
Thank you for putting me in my place, virtuous knight in shining armor
Thank you :)
Idk ask the Portuguese people in azores, they are irradiated from the American support
The base had radioactive stuff secretly there and illegal (has far has i know), and several cases of cancer are associated to that
Well in Portugal they used to use Lajes' Air Base ever since 1942 during WW2, when we leased it
In 2018 they withdrew major operations from it and I'm glad for it
The joint UK-US lease during WW2 might have been needed to allow for efficient war against the Axis (the Azores are undoubtedly the best air base in the Atlantic due to how easy it makes traversing it, allowing for simpler movements when talking about Europe-America logistics) but I'm glad they packed up and left
Like someone pointed out below, the USSR withdrew their forces after the end of the Cold War
America kept it and even tried to expand it
The ssoner they pack up and leave, the happier I get
Lots
I can only remember Poland, Romania and Bulgaria
Ukraine will never field American troops as their presence against the Russians might trigger WW3 and fortunately, the U.S.A aren't really that fond of it yet and refuse to take part (proxy wars are still they way to go in their foreign policy ahah)
Unless you consider the Balkans or even Turkey, Eastern Europe
Then it's a completely different can of worms as there are actually some bases
The Warsaw Pact had already fallen by the time they collapsed
Even more, the U.S should have withdrawn as well as their primary target didn't exist anymore, yet their presence continued after
Russian forces are still present in some territories but nowhere near as many as the U.S and it doesn't have to do with the collapse of the USSR as much as the fact they wanted to maintain their grip
Otherwise they would have left when their enemy had fallen
I didn't say they didn't exist, just that I didn't see them as countries that "consider an American military presence to be a guarantee of safety from a Russian invasion
Well I didn't know, otherwise I wouldn't have said so
Besides, I consider all of the above more Baltic than Eastern, which doesn't mean you aren't right but more that I wasn't thinking about them and did not know enough about their situation regarding U.S military presence
I thought nowadays they relied more on themselves and their neighbours, like Poland, Sweden, etc
I lived in Scotland for a year and I don't think I ever bought a bottle of water there
The tap water memes are real
Unfortunately it's very hit or miss in Portugal
Where I live you certainly can't drink it
But I do prefer our bottled water over that of other countries
We got some pretty good cheese too
Definitely can't compete with the top dogs in Europe, but I'd say we're a solid second tier
Hold up
What
Maybe you are thinking about ultra pure water
Supposedly you can't drink that water since its so pure it will strip the nutrients off you
Not really
But in my town, there is an ice cream shop owned by a polish family that does also pierogies
None that I know of
We have plenty of ukrainian/russian (or bielorussian) grocery stores, a few romanian or moldavian as well but polish or polish immigrants I never met
We had a big influx of immigration from Ukraine/Moldavia and other former soviet republics in the early 2000s, many stayed and integrated but there is still plenty of grocery shops and some immigrant cafés and masses and things like that
Can it be specific time periods
If so i like a lot Ancient Greek history, mostly because of philosophy
France during the French revolution the development of such an event still amazes me, and the echos that still are present today of things and ideas born from it are amazing
American history during the civil rights era and during the civil war
There are many more but it would be a huge list xP
I love ancient history, particularly that concerning Mesopotamia
I always felt frustrated that my world history classes didn't go into more detail concerning that region and time period
I also find the history of Italy to be incredibly interesting, from the Roman Empire to things like the Papal States, the Lombard League and the unification of the country and rise of Fascism
1577
Maybe beat some sense into a certain somebody before returning home
I'm scared a week would be enough time for me to die, but I'd be very interested in seeing Lisbon, as well as other parts of the country affected by the 1755 earthquake/tsunami before the latter happened
Also would be cool to see the country during the Roman and Moorish eras
The week before the earthquake of 1755, Lisbon was at its peak because of the golden era of the discoveries and I always wanted to have a view of the opera that was just built when the earthquake happened
Hmm
This is a tricky question due to the vast history in here and there's many situations in history I would love to see with my eyes, so will give you 3
Battle of São Mamede, where our first king revolted against his mother creating the first kingdom of Portugal and gaining independence from Castille
Battle of Aljubarrota, one of the Spanish (Castille) invasions where we defeated them (6,6k Portuguese vs 31k Castilleans)
Or the first time we arrived in Brasil would love to see what was the reaction of the first tribes to cross paths with the Portuguese and the reaction of the Portuguese, how they lived and how was their day to day life
The only right answer
Omg same like I’d probably die but I just want to SEE IT
If you were allowed to change history and go back to try and get people to vote to stay in what would you do
Next year king Sebastião went on a crusade in Morocco without a heir, leading in a decise defeat and the death of much of the Portuguese elite
Good option
Or marry someone
Moreover, he went to fight inland and lost to attrition, essentiallly, when the whole reason Portugal had been dominating warfare against our enemies at the time through naval force and attrition
I can sing the French and German anthem
I also can humming Spanish (because they don't have official lyrics) and Russian anthem
Interestingly, I don't know anything about the UK anthem
That's all rich ppl do in soap operas but I've meet a few ppl that could've be considered wealthy or better off but I only new this cuz my friends would tell they were loaded, otherwise mb if you check the clothes or smth to know how much paper they carrying
The show with more episodes is the Portuguese version of the "[Price is right] which has been running continuously, every day, since the 11th of February 2002
Over 3600 episodes, and counting
It started as a way to help people get used to the prices of things in euros
Azores accent - Portuguese island
On the news they get subtitles
Specifically the accent from the island of São Miguel
The Açores consist of nine islands, and their accent is by far the worst
I disagree
Some areas of Andalucia have the strangest accents where they eat half their words and speak super quick
Spanish from the Canary Islands is also quite challenging
You guys can even understand Portuñol
Truly impressing on your part
More precisely in Rabo de Peixe, it's the most hardcore accent
Can confirm this
In college I had classes with a girl with some accent (I couldn't pinpoint where from) but I perfectly understood what she said
When she mentioned she was Azorean I was really surprised
I don't recall what her island was (I don't think she ever told me lol), but I'm sure it wasn't São Miguel
I'm a native portuguese and I can barely understand a word of what they say
We need to put subtitles to understand [this]
Every winter in the highlands of Beira Interior as well as several places in the  Northeast regions
Last winter it covered several districts [Viseu, Guarda, Castelo Branco, Bragança and Vila Real]
I hear it snows in the far north and the Serra da Estrela(Mountain chain) and in 2004 it snowed in Lisbon
unfortunately I didn't experience it
In my city, NEVER
In some parts of the country it snows every winter
It snows in the winter in some parts of the east and northeast but never in my region (Porto) unfortunately
Haven’t seen snow in Lisbon since 2004, and it went away just like that
Not exactly sure, but in my 18 years of existence it snowed 1 time on the 6th of January of 2009
At least where i live it was 1 time
Exactly the same in Portugal
Iberian Brothers at it again
In portugal too
Same in Portugal
>Also, let's talk about where to put the currency mark
Do you put it before (€500) or after (500€) the amount
Usually "500€", because we say "500 euros", not "euros 500".
Not quite
We use the intervals for the thousands separation, and dots are also acceptable
For decimals, **only commas** are acceptable
10 000 000,00
000
000,00
Are both correct forms
And Brazil, which annoys us, Portuguese, to no end
Did not know about that hahahaha exactly
With the billions and "thousand millions" too
Se estiveres no telemóvel/tablet tens que dar dois enters para dar parágrafo
Fair enough, I guess I meant it as Portuguese being more intuitive in that regard and applying "the way we speak" to "the way we write".
If think in some official documents like bank reports and the like, the symbol might also appear before (i.e, € 500 or even EUR 500), but granted those sort of documents usually have an international audience or have to comply with international norms, hence that usage
In regular Portuguese writing, the currency symbol always comes after the number
You mean, dots for decimals
I get people writing them informally/casually and I also accept the programming context, but in accounting, in official documents
I really doubt it and if it does happen, they're most definitely doing it wrong
I really don't see anyone doing it officially, just because of the sheer confusion it would generate among other colleagues and in that business area alone
Religion is usually seen as a private affair and most people don't mention what's their stance about religion unpromptedly
However, if the question arises and someone says they're an atheist no one would bat an eye
It's not unusual or stigmatised to be an atheist, here
I'm an Atheist and don't have any complaints
Sure, some of the more religious older people will probably think it's strange but who cares
Depends on who's viewing I guess
Older people (WW2 kids to about 80s kids) are very religious so they'd probably complain or make the usual kind of innocent remark "But you'll go to hell" or something along those lines
Our country's history is very aligned with Christianity so it's normal
Younger people honestly don't care and have a much higher percentage of atheism than older people
i guess most of the people are very neutral but a lot of us celebrate christmas
I don't think one thing percludes the other in Portugal
It's perfectly feasible (and common) for an atheist (provided they're not the fundamentalist type) to celebrate Christmas, here
There's enough secular aspects to it, that you can celebrate it without any issue
I'm an atheist and I love Christmas
yeah, youve got a point
yea but the point is, Christmas is technically a religious celebration
Selfie man
Selfies and more selfies
Also, he is always talking to people and going to like town fairs and stuff
Overall awesome
If you haven't took a selfie with him yet, you're in the minority
Don't forget how he pushed Trump's arm
Don't mess with the Professor
I once met Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa in a restaurant, when they accidentally sat us at his usual table
Apparently he really likes that restaurant, even having a favourite place, and the bosses made mistakes and confused the days (it was Wednesday and they thought he only came on Thursday, something like that)
Then, the boss, completely ashamed, comes to me and apologizes, asking if we could sit at another table and that he himself would offer us the meal as compensation
My sister and my cousin were happy with the deal, but I decided to be a prick, pretending to not understand what was going on to see if they offered us anything else
Hearing this, Marcelo appears from out of nowhere saying that there was no problem and that we could finish our meal in peace, that he would wait at the bar
As a fan of Marcelo, I immediately changed my tone and offered him the seat
He was very grateful, shook my hand and gave me his personal card, asking me to call him later
That night I called him and, to be brief, we had a torrid passion for 11 months, man to man, that I will never forget
Our bodies intertwined in one, and from Morocco to the French Riviera, at the bottom of the sea of ​​the Galápagos Islands and in the frozen section of the Jumbo, next to the fish sticks, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa and I gloriously fucked in six of the seven continents
Nah, I'm good (Inb4 drool)
I tried taking one when he went to the Congresso Nacional de Medicina Geral e Familiar in 2017, but there were way too many people trying to take pictures with him so I gave up
She's literally a predator
I'm willing to bet that if it was a 39 year old man and a 15 year old girl you wouldn't be saying "let them be" and "who cares"
I think people are missing the point
It's not that she was older than him it's that she was 40 and HE WAS FUCKING 15
There's a big difference between an adult/adult relatuonship and an adult/underage  boy relationship Jesus fucking Christ I'll say it again if it was man going after an underage girl he'dve been dead the minute he laid eyes on her
I'm not criticising Macron I'm criticising his predator of a wife
With a sh sound
Although our phonetics tend to pronounce the letter "s" as a "sh" in numerous situations as it is
In Portuguese it's written "Budapeste", which is pronounced exactly like *Budapesht*, so pronouncing it the same way in English doesn't bother me
In Portuguese we say budape-shte
We love our sh’s
With a "sh" sound but that's not because of the Hungarian pronunciation
It's just that "st" is pronounced "sht" in Portuguese
We only pronounce that sequence with an s sound in foreign words
In portuguese we pronounce some S letters with a G/J sound so, considering Budapest in portuguese is Budapeste, it would be something like "Boo Dah Pehj Te" (hard to explain but oh well I tried)
So it's kinda a Sh sound
With an S sound
However, S sounds in some accents of Portuguese tend to drift naturally into Sh sounds, specially at the end of syllables
Yes, in Portuguese when a "s" comes before a consonant it always makes a "sh" sound
Nah, it's almost always a Sh sound if it's before consonants in Portugal
Brazilians might say "Budapesstxi" in some reasons, though
Depends on the accent
Some beira interior accents, like for instance from the Guarda region, occasionally pronounce it like an s, even if there's a consonant afterwards
Like in the words: "descer; nascer; piscina".
depends on the accent
some people from Center/North Portugal would tend for a more ssss sound
But those are exceptions
They still use the "sh" before consonants except the C.
In fact, most of the country just says "desher" "nasher" and "pshina", so the sc is a special case in most parts of the country anyway
Add it to the big board of Portuguese pronunciation rules :D
That's totally true, of course, but for the most part that's in this way
No we don't. It's always a sh sound
Budapeste
it's not
there are accents where the S sound doesn't turn to Sh, believe it or not
In Portugal
No there aren't. The only exception is how high beirão people say "sc" and say "nacer". But everyone says a sh before a t.
I was born and raised in the Azores, granted it's not half way around the world but it's off continental Europe, and I feel perfectly European
We might be more up to date with mainland stuff through TV stuff than previous generations but there's still plenty to be aware of on a daily around here
When it comes to representation and knowledge of us on the mainland it's absolute crap still
Which island, if you don’t mind me asking
It’s just funny, I’m half portuguese half American with an Azorean mother (you can guess from which island) and in the US most of the people I meet with a connection to Portugal are of Azorean descent, and the islands seem to me to almost unilaterally represent the perception of Portugal there, but now that I live in mainland Portugal, I’m surprised by how separate the islands feel from the rest of Portugal
Everyone knows by now that Portugal == Lisbon
The rest is scenary
Gotta get those Websummits going and those hostels popping and those rents skyrocketing
I think I would  like to live there
I'm planning on visiting in September
Tired of Lisbon, tired
We maybe need another earthquake (but without deaths)
A quick search on the internet and I found out that roughly half of the population of the island is Portuguese or Portuguese-descendent, we are everywhere
Terceira
I'm guessing your dad was or is in the air force
There's a US/PT/NATO military base
I grew up on that base for the early part of my life
It wasn't nothing, there were so many people from the US and it was awesome
Quite a bit of cultural and linguistic stuff that the islanders who grew up in or around the base got, such as the word for mop, sounds a bit like map in English and Portuguese, so we started calling the mop map in Portuguese, that's one thing that gives us the look from other islands and mainland
Loads of fun
Well, used to be
When Benfica faced PSG that one time in 2007, half or so of Parc des Princes was full of Benfica fans
It felt like Benfica was playing at home
Lol I always mess up the name of that city
- Japanese, because I'm into a lot of stuff made in Japan (I swear I'm not that much a weeb
- Italian, because I like the sound of it and because I want to explore the country without there being a language barrier
- Arabic, Egyptian to be precise
A lot of countries speak have Arabic as their official language, plus I think it sounds cool
Japanese, Chinese and French
I am already learning French
I could speak better when I was younger but I still need a lot of training
* Russian, so I could read my favourite books in their original language
* German and French, so I could speak to the largest number of fellow Europeans in their native tongue
I like learning languages so even though the languages on my "to learn" list are french, german and italian, I'd probably choose some harder ones like mandarin, japanese or some form of arabic
The other ones I can learn on my own
Wait, there's an Iberian language
Oh I'm a recovering weeb
There's still a lot I like about the country, but I'm no longer a "Japan ichiban
" type guy
If I could pick one more language it would probably be German
I did actually start learning it, but my studies are currently on hold
I should get back to it
You may know that Portugal and the Portuguese are also called Lusitania and Lusitanians
We strongly identify with the Lusitanians
Even Brazil was first called "New Lusitania". That said, it would be very interesting to know how the original Lusitanian language sounded like
Likely drastically different from Galician-Portuguese
we don’t have monuments from USSR but we do have monuments from the Portuguese communist party to the communists that died fighting for freedom when we were run by fascist dictator Salazar

In Portugal I've never seen a police officer without a holster and a handgun
In Portugal most of them are armed with unloaded glocks :'')
France is a place with some agitation, police with guns is understandable
Portugal is a very peaceful place, even our protests are very orderly
I don't think guns are necessary but the police has them, small ones at their waist
In Portugal police has guns too
They have small guns at their waist
They almost never use them
I was taught that America is a continent with subcontinents in it (América do Norte, América Central and América do Sul)
We are also taught about Oceania, Australia is just a country for us
I've always heard the world consists of 6 continents and 5 oceans
That's it for us too
Really
I was taught there were 2 continents in America
Europe, Africa, and Asia are one contiguous land mass
Whether they are considered a continent technically or not I’m not sure
I’m not sure rivers and canals count, otherwise the Panama Canal would split North America
A joke
Cycling in Portugal is a sport, not a way of getting around
I am aware of some local exceptions but even those pale in comparison to what you see in central Europe
Doesn't help that we have rather hilly cities and that most places close enough to bike to work would be prohibitively expensive for most people
Unless we had dedicated train/metro carts for helping this out, I don't see it ever becoming a thing in Lisbon/Porto, and other cities don't even have that (although biking distances in other cities are more feasible, terrain aside)
We still could do a lot better than what we do
Our cities are also much hillier than those in central Europe, perhaps that's why it's not as popular as other countries as a way of commuting
I mean, i spent about 4 years of my life going to school by bike, and honestly it worked perfectly fine, better than car imo
I don't think the existence or non existence of a specific bike only line matters at all, but then again i'm young and fit so i guess dedicated bike roads would matter to others
I started cycling around Lisbon a few months ago and I must tell you it's not that bad
Before I thought I'd need an olympic preparation to commute but it's been alright
How far away was your school
I'm sure it's perfectly doable, it's just that a psychological barrier is still a barrier
It's not like being in good physical shape should be something to avoid anyway
I think the biggest issue might be the lack of office showers in most places
In that case i suggest you to climb a hill in Lisbon with just gears
If you don't know what we are talking about i suggest you to see some video of the downhill race that Redbull organize some years ago
Anyway Lisbon could be a cycle city if you consider to maintain on the same level (across the river for example) and we are at the age of electrical bikes that could help with some of the climbing (not all)
Here you go, it took less than 5min searching, one at 179euros

There are likely more, but I'm trying a low ball estimate, here
E*: I never know for sure if my expectations of "what everybody knows" align with my fellow countrymen's expectations
Would João Gonçalves Zarco, the first portuguese settler capitain of Madeira count
Maybe not for everyone
There are many but probably the main would be:
D. Afonso Henriques - first king of Portugal
Aljubarrota Baker- a lady that after a battle near the Spanish border rounded up and killed a high number of spanish soldiers
Camões - the most important historical portuguese writer, the language is often called "língua de Camões".
Vasco da Gama that discovered the maritime path to India
In more recent history probably
Aristides Sousa Mendes
During WW2 he was an ambassador at France and against orders gave visas to at least 10
000 Jews and up to 30
000 saving them from the Holocaust
I would also put D. Sebastião, everyone knows his legend
>Would João Gonçalves Zarco, the first portuguese settler capitain of Madeira count
Definitely not
Not that well known outside Madeira
I would add to the list:
Infante Dom Henrique
Dom João I
Dom João II
Dom Manuel
Nuno Alvares Pereira
E o Fernão de Magalhães,  antes que os espanhóis o tentem roubar
> Marie Curie
Oh boy
Don't forget Chopin
>is it known Colombus to be italian
There is a local theory, here in Portugal, (not taken seriously by almost anyone) that he is actually from [Cuba] (a small town in the south of Portugal), and that that is the reason why he named the island with the same name
Não é que discorde contigo, mas a história do Fernão Magalhães ser a primeira pessoa a circumnavegar a Terra é mesmo muito puxada
He will save us from Sócrates
A história é realmente puxada, até porque o homem morreu a meio do caminho mas isso não impediu a América e a Colombia de receberem o nome de gajos que nunca lá puseram os pés
I mean if you include Marie Curie, who had no ties to France until adulthood, Chopin has a bigger connection with France having French ancestry and move to France at around the same age as Marie Curie
No, our tourists were also prone to do balconing in your country a few years ago (mostly in Lloret del mar) and a few died
I don't remember hearing it happening often here, though we also have balconies galore
Regarding Brits as tourists, most are well behaved, except for football holigans who don't  know how to act as civilized human beings and the occasional drunk Brit
In the UK they're used to drink huge pints so they come here and think our small Superbock beer is the same, but it has higher ammounts of alchool, causing them to get drunk very fast
Then there was what happened with Maddie McCann
There was a journalist who encouraged the British to boycott Portugal, comparing us to a 3rd world country, insulting the police, the population, calling us sardine breath, among several xenophobic insults
British turism in Portugal increased in the following year regardless of his article
We had them drop off NEMO in Amsterdam and eating their own dogs high on shrooms and stuff, which led to them getting regulated
I think those are Germans though, Brits are mainly known for traveling to Amsterdam with either a group of 20 guys or 20 girls
Girls get into all the clubs, guys are stuck drunkenly roaming around and only get accepted into the shittiest places
Normally in year 12 (senior year in high school) students organise trips (without any kind of adults present) to places like Lloret de Mar, Ibiza, Pas de la casa etc where the sole purpose is to get away from the parents and get drunk
I don’t think our tourists go there for stags and I don’t think rugby attracts that many people from here (despite being a sport that has a few followers)
Mainly they’re just drunk kids on balconies
I don't know why I said German, it was a French tourist and it happened years ago :P
Here's an article:
You’re right I’ve always said Lloret del mar for some reason, kind of a habit I guess
Corrected, thanks
That might be it, I’m almost sure I’ve heard Lloret del mar in the news, at least now I know how to spell it
I like it, compared to portuguese I would say it's better for song writing
I pretty much read and speak at a native level so if I´m reading a book that was originally written in English I will just read that instead of dealing with the portuguese translation that I have found to be imprecise at times
As comparison I also had French classes in school and that one never 'clicked' for me and I could never speak it at a passable level, but that probably is due to all the English language media we're exposed to, makes learning it easier
> I don't know how it works in other Romance, Germanic or Slavic languages, but I feel similarly about this when writing multiple-clause sentences in English, since in Portuguese it's usually okay to string multiple thoughts into one sentence, so long as it's linked with linking words and expressions, whereas in English you're more expected to instead keep short sentences and this usually ends up in repeating subjects and verbs many many times in a paragraph, which is a nightmare because you can't imply or infer them due to lack of verb conjugations
That's a (hyperbolicly) Portuguese style sentence
Here's how it should be:
> I don't know how it works in other  Romance, Germanic or Slavic languages
I do feel similarly about this when writing multiple-clause sentences in English
In Portuguese it's usually okay to string multiple thoughts into one sentence
To do so, you must link the sentences with words or expressions
Conversely, in English you're more expected to instead keep short sentences
This usually ends up in repeating subjects and verbs many many times in a paragraph
This is a nightmare because you can't use implied subjects to infer them, since verbs aren't conjugated
The simple grammar allows us to build sentences more clearly without requiring super-specific terms, which is foreigner-friendly
Portuguese has more specific words (and so does English via French), but those require a more advanced level, particularly in using verbs to track the time where something occurred: "Will have been done" is a lot simpler to get than "Estará feito", even though it's less elegant
It's like vanilla ice cream
I like it, but it's slightly bland, specially when compared with Portuguese
It's a lot more straightfoward, however it is less
expressive
The grammar is way easier than Portuguese though, specially the noun genders and verbs
I also think it may sound better in singing since it's more "round", but Portuguese sounds better in rap because the syllables are better defined and the language has more sounds (ã, hard r as in Ronaldo, ç, etc)
I also very much prefer British English over American English, the pronounciation sounds so classy and I try to speak with that accent
Oh, and the pronounciations in English are absolutely awful, my number one enemy
Just look at "coronel/kernel" or "pique/queue". In Portuguese you just read the word as it is written
Lastly, it is very interesting that sometimes I want to say something in Portuguese but I can't find a way to do it as nicely as in English or the other way around - things like "saudade", for example
Yeah, I actually meant to write "colonel" but wrote it as it is in Portuguese -_-
Para bom entendedor
Meia palavra
It means "half a word". "As minhas palavras" would mean "[The] My words".
/u/BernardoCamPt is completing a popular saying I started above:
"Para bom entendedor, meia palavra basta", meaning "For a good *understander*, half a word is enough". Which is the sort of thing you'd say to someone who hasn't understood you because you didn't explain something properly, but you have the feeling that you said it well enough for the rest to be implied
Portugal, Castelo Branco: i quite feel safe cuz the vírus on Portugal is more concentrated in Lisbon, the problem is, since we have less public transportation, my bus has a bigger route now, which is almost 70km, so Im gonna be very tired, and since Im going to 12th (last year of school) i only have classrooms at the morning, and i only have One bus at the morning and One at the afternoon, if Im lucky ill have my motocycle license by then

Unfortunately, not in a positive way, due to Romanians – Romani, most of them – begging and selling crap in the streets
So, for most of us, Romania and Romanian are perceived like that
Since I have visited your country many times, when I am speaking with someone about it, I try to explain that it isn’t exactly like that
We don't really talk about Romania here, but I'd say Dracula/Vampires and Gypsies would be the two first things people think about, sad to say
Gypsis
Wanna bet
Fellow speakers of a Romance Language, do you feel there are more similarities between us than just the language
I'm Azorean Portuguese, I don't know exactly what I feel closest to but I know for sure there's a big gap between I and people of these islands to the mainland and Mediterranean oriented areas of Europe, Italy and much of coastal Spain
I don't consider Portugal a Mediterranean country for the most part, southern Portugal seems to be the exception
If anything, I could probably say my life is a bit closer to northern Portugal and Spain or even parts of France because of the climate and even then it's a stretch, we have hundreds of years of culture and tradition making us that much more unique
This question was made towards romance language speakers, not just Europeans, so feel free to speak your mind
How do the Spanish speaking countries feel about Brazil
I would probably disagree
We have the Christian and Enlightenment background in common with the Nordics - that makes a huge difference in our cultures
Yeah, even though Portugal's southern half is drier and more Mediterranean-looking, people (and tourists that visit only the south) tend to forget that 90% of people live in the top coastal half of the country, so the median Portuguese is used to large quantities of rain and a green-ish/blue landscape except in the peak of summer
I back up this
The Portuguese feel very close to Galicians in my opinion, probably since we're both Atlantic
The rest of Spain is similar, but also different
Keep in mind that through history our link with the rest of Europe were the English, even our guitar came from them, while the Spanish Kingdoms were closer to France, and paid them a lot more attention than their little neighbor in the west, while they also had sovereignty over South Italy for a long time
Also disagree
We have loads in common with Spain, Italy and Southern France
Naturally northern Portugal has more in common with Galicia and southern Portugal has more in common with Andalucia
We are far closer to our the Latin Southern Europeans than any other people
Lots of habits and general outlook on life are essentially the same
The language definitely helps too, I feel more in common with Sicilians than Greeks or Croats for example, but I don’t think we have much in common with Romanians because they’re so different to the rest of us
Wow, I'm an Algarvian, and as such, I know very well Western Andalusia (unfortunately, I never really travelled farther than Cádiz, only in the few times I went to Gibraltar)
I'm wondering: do you fellow Andalusians feel more connected to us Algarvians/people from Alentejo (Alentejians, I guess) than people in the northern Spanish provinces
Personally, I do
I think that's because we had a lot more exposure to Arabs, so southern Iberians are very different to the northern
Italy feels like home to me
The way people sit down to enjoy a nice meal, with some nice company, a beautiful scenery and the general attitude towards life is very similar
(I was in Tuscany and Umbria)
I never met any Canarian and I don't know much about the archipelago so I can't say
Probably Canarians have much more in common with the Madeira archipelago, much closer to Africa and to one another, similar climate, much bigger islands
The Azores, we're smaller islands with the exception of the capital one, gets hot in the summer but not as much as and usually year round it's a lot more damp and since we're closer to the artic we get a very above freezing but chilling northern draft when the wind changes
Last year I and my mom were in northern mainland at the start of winter and 10 centigrade there felt like 16 here, people there complained about the humidity but we thought it was plenty good
The timezone is one hour less than the mainland but I think it should be two hours less, we're far enough to geographically justify it but not geopolitically, like going up across the northern portuguese border changes the timezone for Spain, a remnant of the Axis times during the war and nothing else
Funny thing is, our military base is the only one with a military radio station and  every hour we get an update "são X horas nos Açores, uma hora a mais no Continente e na Madeira" it's almost always said like that, every hour, of every day, and I and many others know it by heart, starts and ends with a jingle with a clock in the background
>Naturally northern Portugal has more in common with Galicia and southern Portugal has more in common with Andalucia
And then you have Lisbon which doesn't seme to have an equivalent in the country next door
I've been to Madrid when I was a kid and the City looks completely different from Lisbon
Certainly more than Arabs and Berbers but not more than Catalans or Castilians
Lisbon is quite unique
Madrid also has its own culture that’s distinct from any other place
Barcelona is more similar to Lisbon but still pretty different
I’d say attitudes wise we have more in common with the south of Spain, in Lisbon

In Portuguese it's martelo
has a rather soft sound to it tbh
In Portuguese it's "martelo", if it's sledgehammer then the word is "marreta"
Martelo in Portuguese but, as we speak with our mouths almost closed and our teeth clenched it sounds extremely badass
it doesn't mean the same thing
"Martelo" is a hammer, "marreta" is a sledgehammer
If they rent, I guess that they don't save anything and still have to borrow from their parents to be able to eat something
Entry level salaries for those who have work basically cover transport, rent, utilities aaaaand, you're broke

Ainda estou para ver o excelente ordenado de engenheira mestre que vou receber
Ao menos é um curso que dá para ter emprego
Nós de letras não se arranja nada
Tirei tradução e é impossível arranjar trabalho
Já está tudo ocupado e quem ainda precisa de tradutor prefere pedir aos amigos que sabem “falar bem inglês” do que pagar a alguém com um curso
Enfim, este país vai de mal a pior mas também não estou com planos de emigrar portanto tenho de comer e calar
Já eu cada vez mais penso em sair daqui
Somos muito pequeninos em mentalidade e é exatamente isso que tu dizes, se aparece alguém que faz de graça porquê pagar
Acontece exatamente o mesmo nas empresas de engenharia, se há engenheiros que aceitam o ordenado minimo, para quê pagar mais
É muito triste quando se lê certos comentários neste post de pessoas a poupar 1000€ por mês quando aqui em Portugal é raríssima a pessoa que o consegue fazer
Exacto, também vi e fiquei em choque
Há pouco tempo pensei que tinha arranjado um projecto para traduzir um site para uma advogada, falou comigo, mandou me os textos mais técnicos para ela ver se eu achava que era algo demasiado exigente
Matei ali duas horas a ver os textos e a analisar para lhe dar um orçamento, mandei mensagem a dizer 130€  porque era capaz de ser uma 10 horas por volta do site
Não me respondeu, passado uns dias vieram-me dizer que ela tinha pedido antes ao amigo que sabia “inglês bom o suficiente”. Fui ver o site que está agora completo, tá uma bela treta
Escolha dela
Isso dói na alma
Na minha opinião 130€ é um preço excelente para a tradução de um website
Não é um trabalho simples
Yup, eu por norma cobro 13€ por hora, nem pedi mais por ser técnico nem nada como ainda comecei agora
Mas pronto, PORTUGAL, amirite
Boa sorte para nós haha
Boa sorte para nós!!
Since our northern part of the country has more people than our southern part, I would expect this switch to stimulate construction in the south and the development of new businesses down there, while businesses in the north would face a tremendous time finding new employees, which would probably make the central government develop new immigration policies - this ignoring the freedom of movement inside the country
Not sure how this south and north scenario applies to our Atlantic islands though
You meant Atlantis, right
I like al corona
What kind of oil
I like Molisana and Garofalo
They also both make the only edible whole wheat pasta I ever tried
Barilla meh
A local supermarket has a own brand Italian pasta which is actually very good, basically garofalo
Sometimes it is really hard to not judge Americans and their food and cooking
Molisana is easy to find in continente supermarkets and sometimes it is even 50% off and pingo doce has garofalo and their own brand Italian pasta which is good
To be honest I do not like Spanish brands either, Italian is better
Nacional is too mushy though their vegetable colored pasta is actually ok or at least enough of my family likes it

"Shocks" is a bit of a strong word
I'm sure some things surprise them, but most don't shock them
Maybe the fact we still have bullfighting in 2019 does, though
That's the closest thing I can think of
The banana republics refer to the countries of Central America
In the first half of the 20th century the USA overthrew some governments in the area and replaced them with politicians that favoured the fruit companies that owned land in the countries

I remember doing it once in primary school but that's about it
For me  personally I know I’ll probably live with my parents till mid 20’s and have kids I hope in my 30’s :) my parents had me at 40/39 and that worked well so im thinking of doing the same
Not really I don’t think

What stereotypes do you have for different regions of your country
In Portugal's case:
- **Minho**: bunch of farmers and fishermen,  yokels who swear like sailors, funny accent, where people actually work for a living
- **Trás dos Montes**: even more farmers, cold
- **Interior**: unknown territory with montains, people often forget it's part of the country, so many sheep
- **Centro**: Coimbra, land of students
Only the litoral matters, the rest is uncharted territory
- **Lisbon**: high maintenance, too many people and too many snobs, if you don't live here you're a peasant
Pansies whose ears start to bleed if they hear a swear word
- **Alentejo** - the desert, even more farmers with funny accents who call every man 'compadre'. Literal Hell during the summer
- **Algarve** - England with beaches and lot's of oranges
- **Azores** - indecipherable dialect, lot's of cows
- **Madeira** - island of bananas, could totally be independent if they wanted, birth place of Cristiano Ronaldo
Do you have sterotypes for different regions in your country
This is not a stereotype, this is true ahahah
What the hell is happening in Corsica
You guys need to leave the island
People don't associate the Basque Country to ETA anymore
I have to ask: what is it with you guys and our towels
Wasn't Napoleon from there
Aaand my Bolognese pasta is ruined
That explains so much
Carbonara would make more sense though
Well, I'm portuguese, living in France, 5km away from Luxembourg and Belgium
Sometimes I go to Germany for shopping (not so much now with covid)
My boyfriend is Italian and we go sometimes to Italy by car (8h travel) crossing Switzerland
Pretty normal for us now, but I remember when I moved here, it was all pretty new and I was always excited every time I crossed a border hahaha
I've only left my country once, went to France by car
Took me 2 days to get there and it was awesome, now sure 2 days is quite a lot but that's how long it would take to go from some US states to other US states (i think)
When the borders open again, it will be special
I miss my neighbors
It is kinda of mind boggling when you are used to one thing all your life and then visit the other place
I've been to the US to visit friends and we drove from North Carolina to New York, it took almost an entire day and we were still in the same country, in Portugal a 3 hour drive is a huge trip
No one in continental Portugal lives further than a 3 hour drive from Spain
I, myself live about 100 quilometres from the border and it wasn't unusual to go to Spain for lunch or a night out from time to time
Yeah its kinda stupid how you literally can just go north to Galicia and when you get there you change Time zone even tho nothing really changes
That’s true
But not everybody goes there often
No one in continental Portugal lives further than a 3 hour drive from ~~Spain~~ the empty wasteland that is the western face of the central plateau of the distance
Outside Galicia and Badajoz, the "closest" things are a bit further out than 3 hours
You have to drive a bit more to Zamora, Salamanca or Seville, and a bit further still for Madrid
Plenty of cool small things to see, but that's a lot of trips to take
I can see that, I'd imagine they use the same work hours as us and most countries with a more suitable timezone, if i feel like shit when it's  that part of winter and i wake up still in the night imagine doing it for a longer period every year, explains a lot about spanish people (partially joking)
We also have them in Portugal
And almost every house has them too
They're useful, but they're not really "aesthetic". Plus they make so much noise
They are common in Portugal too
In Portugal it's mandatory by the law for a newly built house to have a bidet
Who in Portugal uses the bidet to wash their butt instead of toilet paper
Few people
Bidet is used mostly for washing feet and accumulate dirty laundry that will eventually go to the washing machine
I totally agree you, I also use the bidet mostly to wash my feet during summer, but the fact is that even though we don't really use it that much, it's mandatory to have a bidet at home
Uhm, it's actually used by women, too
Who wouldn't, at night
It’s the same in Portugal
One awesome idea I had no notion existed and I saw when I visited the US a few years ago:
\- Drive through ATM Bank Machines
No need to look for and take up parking space just to run to the ATM for 2 minutes
There are public bathrooms here that are free, but most of the time they're pretty disgusting
As for using the bathrooms in shops, cafés and restaurants, it's only fair that you pay to use them (or be a customer) because it still costs the owners
At least in Portugal, *public* bathrooms are all free
Private "public" bathrooms, aka bathrooms in owned establishments such as cafés and restaurants aren't, you're meant to buy something, aka use the establishment if you want to yknow, use the establishment's services, such as the bathroom
This goes to the extent of some cafés having locked bathrooms and a key which the costumers can ask for
Looking at it, for the costumers of the establishment, the bathroom in the end of the day is free
Narrow streets, barely no parking space, labyrinthic street layouts
but this only applies to old quarters of the cities, old cities are not 100% old infrastructure
Reminds me of my parents' café. The building is quite old and I remembering taking measurements inside (we were refurbishing it) and being amazed at just how inconsistent everything was
No measure was repeated
it's not a choice between only those two
old city centers have a mess of cul-de-sacs, one way streets, two way streets that only fit a car at a time and serpentine streets that are not intuitive to cross
I normally say that I'll never vote for the Communist Party, although I respect them
Yup, it has seats in the Parliament and has been one of the parties that supports the Socialist Party government
Lately they've been in involved in some controversies envolving Labour Day, their annual party, and their annual congress (convention)
Excuses in advance for any grammar mistake
Baby Jesus Christ stopped being the main gift bringer and was swapped by Santa Claus
In my region each parish has it's own celebration called Merendeiras, where it's given some blessed bread
Every village that belongs to the parish has it's own representative for that year, called Mordomo, that it's responsible for the religious ceremony and to make a party at their house
But because this is very expensive and there are fewer people in the countryside, there are less and less people taking part of it
We also have the Bolinho/Pão por Deus, on the 1st of November, where the kids go door to door asking for treats for Saints
But once again, we have very few kids nowadays
This day has nothing to do with Halloween, as many people ask me if it's the same
Carnaval is becoming less and less relevant than it was in my parent's time and even then it was much bigger in my grandparents time
Children have school holidays and they might wear fancy clothes for kindergarten parties and some towns got organized parties and events and all but honestly it is something young people just do not much participate
The June saint festivals still huge though
When i see this controversy I always think of [this]
My parents never told me it was Jesus who delivered presents
The again we're not religious
yeah, but somewhere in the 80/90s he decided to outsource to that Turkish guy living in Finland
I don't doubt you but Baby Jesus Christ is the traditional gift bringer
Bullfighting is also disappearing in Portugal, every year that passes it is less and less popular
As the population grows urban, it becomes a more alien reality for everyone
Bullfighting squares are being brought-down and converted to other venues
You still have small towns with their annual bull runs, but that is a different thing
Unfortunately, I believe like in Spain, it has become a contentious political issue which will surely contribute to attract people to the fights and keep it alive just a little bit longer
However, its demise will not be free of down sides
The raising of the bulls ensures that a traditional agro-ecossytem of extensive pastures and low density oak forests is economically viable, and that a breed of cows, which are genetically much closer to the native wild cows of the Iberian peninsula and are a important vault of genetic biodiversity, are kept alive
I think we will find ourselves in a place where, the breed isn't economically viable on its own, and we will need to subsidize it, just to ensure that we keep the biodiversity of both the breed and the ecosystem
He's a baby in December but ages to be a grown man just in time to die in Easter
ah, ah
That road has got loads of space and it is just soft stuff on either side
The problem here is very narrow roads with tall stone walls on both sides
Like this
(I am actually impressed the google maps car attempted it)
And then there are some places in Sintra, which are like that but STEEP and with curves
Google maps can point at some surprising places
I dunno, pray a bit and just go carefully and if your car is big turn back at some places, but do not get very big cars if you live in this city
edit
adding a few more  in case you are interested
Also not obvious on google maps, there is  steepness factor sometimes which does not really "show" as intimidating on google streetview or photos but which is trust me, a thing when driving
Second gear is your best friend, for everything
It is what it is, no wimping out
Some of these places they got delivery vans and trucks coming by
Honestly I have no trouble with narrow roads
I don't consider myself to be a great driver, but narrow and tight roads have never been an issue to
Part of it may have been due to having had a lot of driving lessons inside villages and on dodgy mountain roads
I actually get a bit more anxious driving inside busy cities and, oddly enough, makeshift car parks despite the latter also involving driving through tight spaces and corners
I wish I had a dollar
sorry euro
for every scratch & dent on the cars I see in Sintra
Ah yes, flashback to when I used Google maps to navigate somewhere near Serra da Estrela and I ended up on a stupidly narrow street in the middle of a small village, right after a curve I couldn't back out of
Had to pull off the mirrors of my SUV and navigate using cameras, the motherfucker was beeping all over
But it's a fun challenge
There will be signs if it is specially narrow
Obviously it is one way only
In these narrow streets, you can also see the dents and scratches in the walls of the buildings, especially when the roads curve
Some are even so much dented, it's now literally easier to make the curve
Or Lisbon
There are some interesting parking lots as well (Pingo Doce being particularly bad at this
I could not even find on google streetview (wimps
) the really impressive lanes in Sintra, or the good roads in the smaller Azores islands
But ok, ok, we win
Lisbon is an interesting place to learn how to drive
( and OMG you should see some adapted supermarket parking lots
> why would they build these walls so close to each other in the first place
Because that was the edge of their land, on either side, and when the walls were built the lane was wide enough for existing traffic, like people on foot or horse carts
Duh
Google maps, any automatic navigation thing can be pretty bad
Lisbon can be tricky as well, and you can add parked cars, granite cobblestones, steepness in general
Somebody was asking here some days ago why automatic transmission cars were not popular, and bitches please, second gear is my best friend and I will use first if I need to (my father has got a fancy automatic transmission car and it is fucking embarrassing how stupid it is and how often it will go down on traffic lights on inclines
Not for me)
As interesting as the mainland is, the islands can be well, even more challenging
The Azores are like 99
9% perfectly heavenly driving (hydrangeas
cute cows
velvet like asphalt
the view) and 0
1% fuck it, fuck it, fuck it
Or with traffic lights
A few times yeah
Once driving on a road I did not know, there is a traffic light flashing red some 40 meters way from the crossing (which had houses)
Obviously I stop thinking WTF, this is stupid
Then I understand, from the right hand road from the crossing there is a bus coming, and it is making several manouvers to position itself around that crossing occupying the lane I would have been in
It was a really sharp angled house on that corner, narrow roads
I guess the buses have a remote control for the traffic light
I do not do miles
Check where you are and adjust
And apparently according to an eagle eyed danish redditor, some of those are not one way
Which makes sense because they might be the only way in for some people to bring their stuff home
Such is life
>Why were the roads recessed in the first place
Why go to the trouble of digging those channels and putting walls on either side instead of just building "normal" roads
Because normal road width was not standartized till what 20th century
Because roads were often places where properties met and to use by foot traffic or animal pulled carts
These roads, these properties are OLD
To change it you need to expropriate property which is complicated legally, needs a strong reason and IMO is not something to use lightly
In case this is a factor, and hope this is not a cultural stereotype thing, maybe you are used to urban city centres being rebuilt strongly after world war 2
In Lisbon centre, or Portugal as a whole, the last real wars were first half of the 19th century
There has not been any "opportunity" to tear down old roads and do modern stuff
400 meters
4 km
Isn't that so much better than fractions
backing off 400 meters, yeah it happens
Life
If the UK belongs in Europe or not, it is up to them, no judgement from my side
The perspective is a little confusing so I'm not sure but I don't think it's that significantly bellow ground level
There's this a gate the beginning of the street [ The bottom of the image is distorted but I can't see a significant height difference
>Europe is a continent
Kind of
Because we say it is
I dunno
If we consider Europe a continent Great Britain and Ireland are islands off it right
When we speak of Portugal we speak of continental Portugal and non continental Portugal
I believe in self-affirmation
If Europeans can say Europe is a continent, brits can also say they are not part of that continent
That would either be [Gente da Minha Terra] (people from my land), because of theme of the lyrics and it's a Fado classic, or Grândola Vila Morena
This last one is the song that celebrates the ending of fascism and the Carnation Revolution
This [video] is a scene from a movie (realistic) of that and where the song plays, so you understand the context
It is definitely "Minha Casinha", by the band Xutos e Pontapés.
It already had a status close to the one in question in the past, but that status was solidified after the euro2016 final
Tun tun tun tun tun tun tuuun
Tun tun tuun - tun tun tuun
The lyrics "so jung und doch so alt" really hit it right IMO
I think of either Kraftwerk or NEUNUNDNEUZIG LUFTBALLONS AUF IHREN WEG ZUM HORIZONT
Thanks for sharing, they are great
I would suggest also [USA] and [Free
mp3]
And also Xutos and Pontapés' song "Minha Casinha" !
Or the iconic song by current Candidate to Portugal’s Presidency “[Pão com Manteiga] (literally “bread and butter”)
The Portuguese named Cabo Verde (Green Cape) after a cape in Senegal, that they themselves called Cabo Verde (nowadays Cap-Vert), and it's messed up, because they are hundreds of kilometres apart
The islands are very dry actually, not that green
There's a city in Portugal called Portalegre, which translates to "Happy Port" (Porto = Port, Alegre = Happy)
The thing is that it's situated inland and isn't surrounding any body of water, which begs the question as to why they named it that
there's a town called Vila Nova de Milfontes in southern Portugal, which translates to New Town of a Thousand Fountains
It has no fountains in sight and is located on one of the driest regions in the country
Lived there for a whole semester
I wondered why there were so many boat logos, especially on travel agencies
Is there any story behind it
I think I heard once that the reason for the name is that the houses were built with wrecked boat scraps
I live in the Guadiana Valley and I can confirm, the river's quite rivery
Lots of riverness
an interesting thing about Carthago:
it was founded as a colony by the Phoenicians who headed west
Later, Carthago headed west and founded a colony called Cartagena in Spain
Centuries later, people from Cartagena went west and founded Cartagena de las Indias in Colombia
That is a legitimate fear
However, this is already happening
Not because big countries are overpowering small countries, but because globalization makes multinational companies able to pick and choose where they do business and pay taxes, which removes some national sovereignty, especially in smaller countries
Maybe forming a block of countries as the EU has is a good idea to counter-act this phenomenon, and the fear of losing control to big countries could be mitigated through a framework of states' rights and degressive proportionality (the latter already exists in the EU Parliament)
And it's basically inevitable
The reason dialects sprung in the first place was because different communities were isolated from each other, leading to the development in the way they spoke in different directions
With the Internet and other forms of globalization, we are closer to other communities than ever, and so our speech is more similar than it would have been
It's outlandish to think the central EU government would make everyone learn German or English as their first language
I think the US is now ahead of the EU in terms of GDP (even with the UK still in the EU), but you're right about the influence of EU regulations outside of the EU
There's even a term for it: the [Brussels effect]
Spain is far from perfect, but in Catalonia they have 'language immersion,' in which they learn subjects in both Catalan and Castilian (at least 25% as per the Supreme Court)
But you're right, there aren't many good examples for this, and Spain could do better to respect language diversity
> The only one which could possibly used as an example is Switzerland
And it's pushing it tbh, aside from it being an incredibly unique country you'd be hard pressed to find a Swiss person who didn't speak (swiss) German to a decent level
I would argue that a European Federation would also be an incredible unique country, and that there's nothing wrong with having a common 2nd (or 3rd for some countries) language between all countries, because it would certainly be English, which every country already teaches from a young age
The thing that I believe would set us apart is that you can't force one language when there is no majority support for that language
And in a Federation of 24 languages, either public opinion in many countries has drastically changed, or you're not touching education with a 10 meter (ha) pole
The largest language group is German of which there are 80 million in the EU, while the rest of the EU is 370 million (not including the UK)
I don't see French people ever giving up on speaking French
I have a great work life/personal life balance I can't complain, I sleep well, I have time during the day to have lunch and yeah I leave at 18:00 and can do whatever I want
During both lock downs in Portugal, I had the hardest time sleeping
I'm a teacher and teaching from home isn't active enough for me
I don't think you need that time off in the middle of the day if you work in an office or any other place indoors but, if you work outdoors, in the Iberian Peninsula that mid day time is pretty awful
I know because I worked in agriculture for some time
After mid day you sit and wait the hottest hours out
This might have changed, though
I stopped working in the fields a long time ago
Happy cake day
Halloween and Black Friday are the probably the biggest ones
I'd say Albufeira
Used to be a small fishing village but was then developed haphazardly into a tourist destination
It's the kind of place you go for a cheap, tacky holiday
So much of the bars, restaurants, and other services are marketed primarily towards tourists and expats, and so expect to see a lot of signage in English only
There's also a large number of foreigners living there, from all sorts of countries socio-economic backgrounds
I've worked there in the past and would have customers (as well as co-workers) from all over
The place feels a bit weird to me to be honest, like I've stepped into another dimension
There are still some very Portuguese parts of the city, and some remnants of the old village, but generally speaking it's become too much of a holiday destination, one which wasn't planned out very well
In the same region you have the district capital Faro, which I feel is very typically Portuguese (in both the good and bad)
Portugal is pretty much Portugal
The southern part has some Arab influences on the architecture but nothing similar to what you have in Granada for example
Not really a city but a region, the region of Algarve, it feels more like, idk, Miami other than your average portuguese city/region
Also Vilamoura, it looks like a weird portuguese version of a small town in Florida, it doesn't look like Portugal, even Albufeira is more Portuguese
I see
I haven't been to Albufeira, but I've been to Vilamoura
This was 20 years ago already though
I vaguely remember it being some huge marina like place with restaurants surrounding the ocean
I've been to Ceuta and it felt like I was in Morocco
Only difference being the signage was in Spanish
From a foreigners perspective
To me typical Spain has  that distinct red earth colour
Sevilla and zamorra feel very Spanish to me
Maybe Barcelona the less Spanish because of how it's built
Vilamoura is a bit weird yes, but I suppose I'm so used to it that I don't even notice it anymore
I've shown some friends from out of town around Vilamoura and they all found it quite artificial (which it totally is)
It's also guilty of that tacky "holiday villa" architecture style, but I will admit I like the greenery and town infrastructure
Also forgot to mention Almancil
While it looks like a very Portuguese town, I always feel a bit uncomfortable there as it's very much trying to go for that boujee tourist/expat crowd, at least when it comes to its restaurants, so many of them having English names and signage
It's funny you mention Florida because that's exactly how I think of some parts of the Algarve
You've got a lot of young people coming on holiday alongside a large number of retired pensioners
Yeah the marina is a big part of the place
Other than that you have two beaches and a lot of golf courses
Also the two biggest nightclubs in the region, at least during the summer
There's also a pleasant nature reserve
It's quite artificial but there are some nice spots to hang around in
It's an amazing place to be in Erasmus
I agree on Albufeira and Vilamoura but Almancil the village itself I don’t think so, mostly because in the village the community is mostly Portuguese and expats but not English
For English it’s more Quinta do Lago, Vale do Lobo which for me are the most foreign places even
Let me guess, you're an "avec", aren't you
(No offense intended, just a joke)
Oh I definitely didn't go to the nightclubs or the golf course
I was 10 at the time
I mean the earth not the buildings
Sorry I wasn't too clear
That's always a sign I've crossed a boarder to spain
If I'm not wrong it's because it's a clay-like soil, that's got his drainage and is great for wine
I wasn't speaking about architecture
I know it's not all like that but It's a fairly common stereotype
I meant the actual ground, because if the clay terrains sorry I wasn't clear
Your right, it's mostly the restaurants and some shops in Almancil
Quinta do lago and vale do lobo are non-gated communities which have some gated communities inside by basically probably 1% are Portuguese if so, are luxury house complexes completely foreign places for local people
If you drove around from Loulé onwards until Spain less and less foreign places you will find
There a big Uk community around Tavira there are some villas like those you find in Albufeira but still Quinta do Lago and Vale do Lobo it’s not just UK
Honestly Portuguese grammar is hard enough now trying to make people make the correct sounds to speak its going to be impossible not even the Brazilians speak like we do
Side note: a friend of mine her mom is from south Africa and has been living in Portugal for almost 40 years and she still has a very very tick accent
Because it would make me feel less special and lazier to learn other languages
I don't want to live in a world where everyone speaks Portuguese to some degree
Maybe a "fair language" that everyone had to lear os Esperanto
Its based mainly on european Languages
Almost everyone under 30 speaks English
France fought to keep England out of the Union and prevent the increase of American influence
No one cared
Now, it’s best we just go along with it
As much as it saddens me, I can’t think of a single reason for any language other than English to be picked
Much less, my own
Almost no one will learn it as well as they do English, cause they’re not bombarded with media 24-7 in any other language
Why portuguese should become the next pan-european language: it would make us more popular, then more tourists would come, then our broke country would make more money
Why portuguese should not become the next pan-european language: it's super complicated
Who says french can easily learn any other language
They are terrible at any other language, and actively suppress the usage of other languages in their country
They dub everything, they have a mandatory quota of daily music in french for all radio stations
Their ridiculous idea of cultural preservation and their annoying and arrogant accent make them terrible at literally all other languages
We had a time like that some years ago
Now, every time someone says, let's go back to the old orthography, we tell them to shut up
It was hard enough to learn the new one
Oh, I'd like that
Portuguese grammar is a clusterfuck
Even more so with the new Accord
But in essence it's very logical and vocabulary rich
But if it's even hard for natives, how would we expect others to learn it
I do like how Å looks like an A with a halo and wonder if you guys use it for your equivalent of the word "Angel". I find the idea amusing
Incredible reasoning
Other people presenting arguments:
-...That’s why I think it’d be easier
Luxembourgish:
-Just make it hard for everybody
See, I have read this explanation before, or something along its' lines, to justify french being the lingua franca, in the 18 hundreads
I just don't remember who or where I read it from
I think it was Victor Hugo in "L'homme qui rit", but I'm not sure
Are you guys taught about these things in school or was this just a happy coincidence
It would be a total nightmare if everyone suddenly learned Portuguese
They would surely do it the lazy way and learn Brazilian Portuguese, which would infuriate every single European Portuguese speaker
And if they tried to learn Portuguese from Portugal, everyone would do it terribly
>I'm a fan of latin though can't we just use that like in the old times
I studied Latin for a bit in HS and dropped it quickly
No thanks
Just think how much easier the spelling would be for everyone, though
I think that if you provided them a draft, most bureaucrats would be up to the task
It's not that hard, specially compared with other European languages like German, Finnish or Icelandic
southern europeans would have a heart attack
Yeah, but everyone would go deaf in 2 years
Wrong
Portuguese has more verb tenses and a more flexible sentence structure
You can say "amo-te" or you can say "te amo", you can say "a rich man" or "a man rich", as simple examples
As saying "I'm doing something" in the present, you've at least 3 verb tenses: "faço" , "estou a fazer", "fazendo". All these differences carry a different nuance that's hard for non-natives to grasp since there's no equivalent
It's also hard for natives
The pronoun "você" it's not really a thing
The correct one is "vós", the second person of plural
But nobody uses it because conjugation is too difficult
Also vocabulary is broader
I'm a native and I need a dictionary by my side if I'm reading a book originally written in Portuguese
Can't really compare with those, because I'm not fluent in them
But look at [this guy] How many people you know speak like him
He speaks super correct Portuguese
Or even, how many people you know use the 2 person of plural correctly or even at all
ahaha
You just read my mind
Because, after reading that swedish also has Å, I was considering asking how you guys spelt angel
I think you mean half of Luxembourg is Portuguese (which is still an hyperbole but much closer to reality)
Either way, there’s no reason I’d have an advantage
That’s like saying it’s easy for a Japanese to learn Portuguese just because Brazil has the largest Japanese community outside Japan
It's similar, yes, but more broad
There's a lot of verb tenses and nuances
The language is very very vast and takes a long time to master
I'm 25 and I still need to have a dictionary with me when I'm reading a book originally written in Portuguese
On the plus side, it's very versatile
Which one of them
I vote for caló.
We already have co-opted a lot of it as our slang, so I feel like I could use that as a learning stepping stone
It is almost the same here in Portugal, and if you miss understand one of those specious expressions, you end up paying fines
I didn't really understand what the video is supposed to show
I mean, half of the words there I haven't used in years, if at all, and I'm a native speaker
No no no, I disagree just because
Yes, I was comparing with the other Romance languages, not German
For when you said this
>Portuguese grammar is like the grammar of all roman languages beautifully easy
You can't compare a language that evolved unbridled through more than 1000 years with modern Spanish and Italian, which were reviewed for purposes of unifying the respective countries relatively recently
giving itself to Spain like a pussy bitch back in the 16th century
I would say participating in WW1
Uhhh in recent history, letting Salazar in to power and fascistic regime
Overall history : slave trade and letting King Sebastian be raised by Catholic war mongers and noble War mongers
OLIVENÇA É NOSSA
Sweet, sweet karma
nope, just a failure
But the thing is the king had other noble Portuguese cosiness in Portugal that could and were even more legitimate to being heir to the thrown
Although the at least its just a royal union that we were able to overthrow and lasted only 60 years

I like to drive thru the streets of Porto at night listening to midnight city by M83
10/10 would adopt it as our backing track
In fact the whole album where it comes from
Edit : link to the song in case you don't know it
Edit 2 - Oh boy, I'm ashamed
Called the artist M84 instead of M83
Definitely thos one
It's a traditional Portuguese song from a renowned Portuguese Fado singer
a lo-fi remix of "A garagem da vizinha" by Quim Barreiros
Oblivion has such a great soundtrack
LOL
Where are you from btw
I think that's the wrong link
Yeah, I was kidding since he literally sings the opposite of Fado, the genre of music he sings is called musica pimba in Portugal, basically yeah songs full of sexual innuendo
Oh I see
Os Bichos da Fazenda is awesome too
Maybe our university tradition of wearing a black capes but them it wouldn't ld be unique to us anymore, so I'm not going to share that since it's to cool, maybe instead our love for the sea and our delicious dishes and or melancholic yet hopeful and sad Portuguese poetry (Fernando Pessoa and his multiple personalities poems, Camões poems and "Os lusíadas" , Eça de Queiroz "Os Maias", Saramago etc
), or our boarder stability and strong sense of unity and nacional pride (oldest consistent board in Europe and world
Bacalhau
We'll give you safety with bonus *Calçada Portuguesa*.
Free of charge
Our safety
Portugal is one of the safest countries in the world
I think that would be more suitable for the Portuguese to offer xP oldest consistent board and a strong sense of unity
dude
how about our hospitality or "saudade"?...
Pasteis de nata aswell
I was hoping this wouldn't be the top comment for Portugal
Goddammit
What strikes me most since moving to Portugal is drivers braking for pedestrians
Seems like a small thing, but completely changes the stress level when walking around
my dude he is clearly joking
Spain has no territorial stability
most spanish people don't even want to be spanish
True, but saudades would be hard because although it has direct translation in terms of coloquial context it doesn't have a true translation that's capable of translating both the emotional melancholy/sadness/anxiety and culture meaning because that word evolve to have that because of historical and cultural of the Portuguese i think that would be hard to both explain and convert to a foreign language and culture, plus there are the  Tuga dumbasses that don't understand  why saudades doesn't have a true direct translation in to other languages and it's unique to us and just replay with "about "missing" " but forget that the culture and emotional context that our has doesn't have a true equivalent
I, unlike a typical Portuguese trait, do not tardy
Yeah we don't need any more
I know that's why i put "xP" , i just trying to join in on the joke :)
Edit error (my dyslexia was hungry ate a few words)
In Portugal, “Betos” or “betinhos” for entitled children/youngsters, dunno where it comes from
“Mãe-Galinha, Pai-Galinha ou Pais-Galinha” for a helicopter mother, father or parents
Galinha means chicken in portuguese so go figure
Same in Portuguese, "mãe galinha".
We also say «meninos mimados»
Even though I don’t understand a bit I think Romanian might be my favourite foreign european language to hear or read just like my dutch favorites
Like sometimes I really get a kick just hearing that famous dutch bakery TV chef speaking on 24kitchen
I gotta find something similar in Romanian lol
Big hug from Portugal
I was born and raised in Porto , and I've never been to Livraria Lello (considered to be one of the most beautiful book stores ever, and also one of the major inspirations for the Harry Potter franchise)
I'm from Cascais, lived there until I was about 25, and still live in the Lisbon area
I've visited more or less all the tourist sites around here
However, I've never visited the [Peninha] which is just a few kms from my parent's place
It has a beautiful view over the Cabo da Roca / Cascais coastline, but for this and that, I've never been there
I went there two years ago, but when we arrived it was raining heavily and we were with the kids, so at the end decided that it wasn't a good idea to visit it
You're not supposed to visit sites near you
If you want to visit something, you have to go abroad
I went there and enjoyed it
Was supposed to visit Stirling castle as well but it was bit expensive
Fair enough—I skipped it the first few times I went to Porto because the line outside was so massive
I don't remember anything for counting seconds but something we do is counting 1 elefante, 2 elefante (1 elephant, 2 elephant) as a way to know how far lightning strick's, or fireworks or whatever really
Each elephant you count is half a kilometer
So if you see lightning, then count to 5 and hear the thunder you know it hit 2
5km away
It takes around 1
4-1
5sec to say it, wich at the speed of sound is really close to .5km
For counting seconds, from where I'm from we would usually go, 1 e 2 e 3 e.... (1 and 2 and 3 and
I learned it has "1 crocodilo, 2 crocodilos, 3 crocodilos, etc
". For the non portuguese speakers is crocodilo = crocodile, just in case you didn't guess it haha
Well yes, but actually no XD
Never hear that one
Which region are you from
Ribatejo over here
I use "crocodilo" in Portuguese as well
Basically in every contry you get a job if you go for medicine
There's a few food-related ones:
* [Sugar-coated] or [chocolate-coated] almonds being the typical Easter treat
* The mid-afternoon meal lanche, basically a snack to keep us going between lunch and dinner
* The amount of rice we eat compared to other European countries and the fact that we heat up olive oil and onion in the pot before cooking rice by default
* Speaking of which, rice and potatoes in the same dish being acceptable
* Restaurants providing, for many dishes, a "dose" and a "half-dose", where the half-dose is typically for one person and the full dose is meant to be shared, and a half-dose costs more than half the price of a dose
I've heard that our daily TV news programmes are way longer than what's normal elsewhere, they last for more than an hour typically
Don't know how true that is though
Eating a lot of cod
Im sorry, what
Come to Alentejo then, we have the best bread in Portugal
Same in Portugal
There's always bread on the table
They're the standard shutters here in Portugal, we call them persianas
Always thought they were only so widespread here and in Spain
> it’s called merenda
That's interesting
In some places in Portugal we use the same word
Hmm, growing up I thought it was an absolutely necessary step, except for Asian rices like basmati and stuff
> I guess you really like to be thorough
Not really, it's just to fit the 20 minutes of football talk and the other 20 of politicians speaking without really saying anything
In Portugal we often have morning and afternoon talk shows that usualy go for 3 to 5 hours
The news usual go for 1 hour to 1 hour and a half
We do, but it's usually considered bland, so unless it goes as a side to something with a stronger flavor, it's allways rice made with something else
If you were to ask my grandma, she would barely be able to start a rice dish without diced onions and olive oil
We do, but we do the olive oil thing before we put the water in
I actually do mean that, among other things
[I actually made a thread on this]  in the past if you want more details and thoughts on that
Hum hum (trás os montes)
Googling them is confusing me actually, especially because I get lots of Brazilian results and the usage of the word (and maybe the popularity of these blinds too) may be different
But anyway, it seems like persianas is more general than just that type of blinds but it's the word we use for them here
What's wrong with Macau
[this] is a little bit higher
Don't forget the gold
We sold metals like volfrâmio to both sides during ww2
Not many know about it, although from what i know it was the only way to maintain neutrality
thankfully we were able to give the allies the navel base in the middle Atlantic, in a way helping punch the nazi cunt
Meh, I don't doubt that but underdevelopment was just the common state of Portugal, colonies or metropolis, up until a few decades ago
IIRC even China liked us having Macau since we had no real strength to hold it in anything but name
I'm quite vehemently critical of how portuguese history is leonized but I don't understand that criticism of the wolfram/tungsten trade to the Axis
Like Sweden and iron it was only logical for diplomatic and economic reasonos to export ores to Nazi Germany
>although from what i know it was the only way to maintain neutrality
That's not true but it did help out good relations with Germany
>thankfully we were able to give the allies the navel base in the middle Atlantic, in a way helping punch the nazi cunt
The Salazar regime was in most of the instances axis-aligned
When Hitler died there was national morning for 3 days
>  thankfully we were able to give the allies the navel base in the middle Atlantic, in a way helping punch the nazi cunt
don't think we gave something we didn't really have or built
Madeira and Azores archipelagos are autonomous regions
They have their own government and some different laws
For instance, they have been applying slightly different rules for fighting Covid-19
Portugal has a couple archipelagos in the Atlantic, they have their autonomous bodies of government for more localized laws and regulations that fit the islands in all terms from cultural to economic that would clash with the mainland government that barely gives two shits about us; heck in the last election, because the far right wing party gained more seats and dethroned (albeit with the help of the center right party) the socialist party after 20+ years of majority lead, I've heard my countries politicians talk about my autonomous region more in the past 6 months than in the past 3 or 4 years
Tbh, other than that I really don't know in which areas are they responsible for
I'll never forget that time Cavaco Silva went on TV to tell us about the status of the Azores or wtv the hell he was rambling about
Me too
Constitutionally they are autonomous regions, but in practice it seems they are just more districts
Never seen those scissors around here but would buy them if I saw them for sale
I once bought a machete / axe from fiskars and it's like the best I've ever seen
I can cut a tree as thich as a bottle of beer with one swing and it doesn't even take much effort
Wouldn't go to a zombie apocalypse even without it
Has the shape of a machete,  with a much thicker blade and ...
...looked up vesuri on Google aaaaand
Yes, it's a Vesuri
History tell us that the French Empire failed to conquer Portugal three times in a row, although it was able to spread the terror onto Portuguese people and they pillaged some of our patrimony
We would, probably, boost our defense industry and the military spending and renforce our military cooperation with the UK, as we did in the past, to prepare for multiple invasion attempts by the French Empire and satellite states
Oh shit, here we go again
Hey, Britain, where are you at
Brazil is now my country
Here's a response: Portugal to England:" hey buddy want to kick some French ass like we did in the past
I have bottles of Porto "
Prety positively, considering 1812 weapons and vehicles are dogshit compared to 2020 weapons
Middle finger to them if they telling us to do something we dont want to
You want some help with that, our port are open
Prepare what
Pray for extra cold winter
Can we keep fishing their codfish
Didn't you guys got invaded and the royals substituted by napoleon's yes men
Our snails are better
Initiate Ice Age
Also Galiza and Olivença :D
We'd be looking at Britain hopefully
Good thing we can also kill uncultured chickens so easily
Is called "joke"
Well Portugal and England defeated the French invasions 3 times in row, so basically you guys got shafted for nothing and it was kinda deserving
Hmmm (no offence tho)
Ikr, this is part of me fantasizing in this alternative reality
We technically end up winning more than losing (the lost was mostly economic, but we won a lot in term of culture and in legal advancements like constitucional movement etc
I would say like 85% win and 15% lose overall, if analyse the time period before and after, I'm studying law and this is probably one of the most important events because the modern instruments and ideias introduced by the French invasions lead to the constitutional movement and codification movement was well the Liberal values and humanist values (we were one of the first to abolish the death penalty both in Europe and the world, we had a constitutional monarchy which it didn't last long but it lead to best possible form of political organisation which is a republic, etc
), he lost Brazil but it was for the best both for them and us, and it wasn't really cause by the French but more because the Prince was an idealist that prefer being in Brazil and because the Liberal forces weren't flexible with the demands
Not even regular dumplings are a thing here, much less fruit filled ones
I'd go to the nearest [bifana] vendor/joint I can find
At 4 am I step outside and eat some caldo verde and pão com chouriço [this]
Sandes de presunto would also be a great choice
Come on
Get real
At 11
45 we're all still sitting at the dinner table and the 4 beers we had, we had them with our meal
Since the next 4 will be at a nearby tasca, your bifanas are waiting for you behind the counter when you feel hungry ;)
This guy can into portuguese
If I'd have to choose ONE for Portugal, it would be the [Belém Tower]
and it’s on the coins
Oh yes for sure Palácio da Pena is pretty iconic
Belém tower was built in 1519, and Spanish ocupation was only from 1580 to 1640
Are you talking about the Belém tower
>Could It be also Palácio da Pena
I'd say it's not very culturally relevant
It seems to have had a bit of a popularity boom in the last decade or so due to the growth of tourism in the Lisbon area and foreigners tend to give it more importance than it actually has to us
Though maybe people from the Lisbon metro area have a different view on this
Up to you, normally people edit their comment with a line across the previously wrong statement from what I have seen on reddit
Parallel universe Europe that got transported here /s
Between 1580 and 1640, when we were occupied by the Spanish Filipes
Basically our king D. Sebastião disappeared while in Ceuta trying to conquer Africa from the north
He disappeared in the middle of the fog and never came back, he also didn't had any kids
We still have a running joke that he will return one day
There are two periods where **Portugal** was completely free:
**1139/1143 - 1580**
**1640 - today**
Between 1580 and 1640, we were under the rule of the same king as Spain but kept our crown separated from the Spanish one, and although we had a formal independent kingdom the successive kings we had in common were always messing around with our external policies
Napoleon's occupations in the 1800's also
For me was Paris
Disappointing
Berlin
Not the city itself, but I was pretty disappointed with the service in general
At the Deutsches Historisches Museum, no one at the reception desk spoke English (or they made a point not to)
I can kind of understand German, since I speak Dutch, but it came to a point where my mom had to say "achtung
" (she's a U2 fan) when handing in her camera at the cloakroom to indicate that it was fragile
I definitely don't expect everyone to speak English, but I think an effort should be made to achieve some form of communication when you're dealing with the public
I was also yelled at and told that I should go back to my country when I moved a chair out of the sun (I have chronic migraines and shouldn't be under direct sunlight)
We went to Berlin during a heatwave so it wasn't great for my head
I wish this part was bait but it's not
Bratislava
It's a tourist trap
Dunno if disappointed is the right word, but when I was a kid I went to Brussels and found it rather underwhelming
I believe it was the first foreign European capital I've visited in my life, so I was expecting something really cool, but Brussels really isn't much to write home about
And when I saw the Manneken Pis I was like "...ok that's it
Why is this such a known landmark
The Grand Place was kinda cool, though
Also, the first city I visited in Italy was Como and I found it boring and devoid of life
You always hear about Italy being a beautiful country, which is true, but you won't get that idea if the very first city in the country you visit is Como, believe me
Venice I didn't like that much but Florence completely blowed me away, cologne and berlin I did not enjoy at all but Hamburg and Frankfurt were great really liked them
When did you visit Paris
I went there in the 90s and in 2005
I enjoyed it both times
Agree
I went to Köln when I was a kid
I only remember the HUGE cathedral though
Yeah agree, went there a couple of months and ... I mean it's pretty and has a lot of places to visit but it's basically Tourist Town everywhere you go
I visited a lot of cities in the UK earlier this year and I have to say almost all were pretty bland compared to what I was expecting, the most disappointing being London and the biggest surprise being Birmingham
It's actually quite nice, except the Brummies accent
It's super funny to hear and complete gobbledigook
Why
Come back in July then, because it isn't at all
The people working at the reception desk at the museum that day were all old indeed
The other guy, although he spoke English, was also older
It didn't really damage my image of German people because it was just one stupid guy, but we ended up eating somewhere else :P what can I say, we joked that the heatwave had fried his brain a bit as well (if I remember correctly it was like around 40 °C, I don't think Berlin has the infrastructure for that so everybody was a bit annoyed)
I mean it may be because I had a lot of expectations for London and none for Birmingham, so my opinion may be biased
If you don't like cobblestone streets, I think you're kinda fucked anywhere you go
Except for really old villages, since that type of cobblestone started being used in the 16th century
Cobblestone roads aren't that common though
He didn't like becaus it was grey and depressing, let him burn mid July, I mean we have sun pretty much all year except November-February
In elementary school it's mostly taught the regional, Iberian, cultures so ancient cultures would be
Celts
Iberians
Celtiberians
Romans
and, of course, the Lusitanians who according to my book in elementary school pushed huge boulders at Roman soldiers
In 5th grade, you actually start having a "history" subject, although joint with georgraphy, they separate in 7th grade, and it's from there on that you are actually thaught other ancient cultures like (at least where I went to school)
The Greek citystates
The Egyptians
The Indus Valley Civilization
The Yellow River Civilization
(Don't remember if the ancient civilizaiton in the Americas is mentioned)
The Sumerians
From what I remember, the first two are taught in more detail whilst the latter is just discussed as the first civilization and the other are just represented as the standart "first civilizations of the world"
But I think that's about it, got my old school books somewhere if I wanted to make sure but I'm to afraid to go on a tomb raid
Didn't have history in my highschool course (it hurts so much) so, I theorize they learn ancient cultures in more detail (Assyrians, Babylonians, Hittites, Medians, Persians, etc)
Agá which in english woul be uh-gah
Having said that, H is mute in most circumstances in portuguese, except for nh | ɲ | ; lh | ʎ | and ch | ʃ |
In Portuguese, the letter is pronounced as "agá".
In most words it has no sound, but in conjunction with other letters it can have a sound (c, for example, like in English)
European speakers usually don't pronounce it, but brazilian speakers have a tendency to pronounce it as an "r".
We call the letter "agá". But in Portuguese, H has no pronunciation/sound on its own
"Hugo" (male name) for example, is read as if it was "ugo".
However, when combined with some consonants, it does modify the sound
Those combinations are "ch"  (like in "chá" which means "tea", the "ch" it's pronounced like the "sh" in English, as in "shell"), "nh" (like in "galinha", which means "chicken", and the "nh" is pronounced like the "Ñ" in Spanish) and also "lh" (like in "milho", which means "corn", the "lh" it's a bit similar to the "ll" in Spanish but not exactly the same I think)
I don't believe you can call it mute
"Ha" e "a" reads differently
No, not really
Fucking hell nordic countries, why is everything you do so forward
In Portuguese, we usually use made-up expressions
Harmless ways to put it:
* **"Para lá do sol posto"** = Beyond the sundown
* **"Em cascos de rolha"** = I can't even translate this properly, and I can't find a single source that explains it's proper meaning and origin
I'd be great if anyone else could try and explain it
Slightly crude:
* **"No cu de Judas"** = In Judas' ass
Incredibly crude:
* **"Santa Cona do Assobio"** = Holy Cunt of Whistling
It plays on how Portuguese name their towns and villages, which usually have religious-based names or just plain weird combinations of words
"no cu de judas" (in the ass of judas) or "no fim do mundo" (at the end of the world)
In Portuguese we use "it pó cu de Judas"  go to Judas ass is the meaning
we have "caralho a 4"
> Em cascos de rolha"
Cork caskets- such a rural and backwards  place that caskets are of cork wood
There's way more expressions:
- **Nos cornos da Lua** - upon the Horns of the moon
- **Nos cabos do Inferno** - On the capes of Hell
- **Onde o diabo/judas perdeu as botas** - wherever the devil/judas lost their boots
"**No caralho mais velho**" = In the oldest dick
Same here, though people always pronounce it Co**n**chichina instead of Cochi**n**china
I don't think most people even know it's a real place
Thank you
: )
I had never heard the first two expressions you list, are they regional
The last is indeed more common, I feel, I totally forgot about that one
Caralho doesn't have a perfect translation to English and also loses its power, you can also translate it to "in the oldest fuck" or "in the oldest balls"
Idk, I've heard them both on tv before, but they could be
>Caralho doesn't have a perfect translation
"Caralho" literally means "dick". It's just that more often than not it's used as an interjection, akin to the versatile way "fuck" is used in English, thus losing that literal meaning
>Edit: I'd also like to nominate this as "the weirdest or funniest thing a foreigner said".
Except /u/executivemonkey is the resident American troll (and a very funny one at that) from /r/europe and /r/AskEurope and has been for years
I'm always surprised people don't recognize his username by now
Yes it did, it was breaking news in every major tv channel and it was a discussion topic for about a week or so
It was all the rage here, it was heavily debate from the news TV channels to news outlets to even in my university in multiple classes between the the professors and students
The event hit home a little bit because Brazil is to us Portuguese like the USA is to the UK, there's a close bond
I heard a bit of it, but it was not massive news
Then there was the new zealand shooting and we were also starting to realize the consequences of Idai in Moçambique
Dunno
First time I hear of it
As bad as a school shooting is, makes sense the NZ shooting got more coverage worldwide
In general yh, the only thing we don't like about you guys are basically a general dislike of dubbing in Brazilian Portuguese on show like in anime in services like Netflix and crunchy roll (for some reason the Brazilian dub of anime and show doesn't match the voice of the characters), and fact that because you are so many, that people forget about Portuguese as a language and say we speak Brazilian in Portugal (it's not your guys fault xP)
Like we all like the former colonies but in general the Portuguese Brazil relationship both diplomatic and from a public opinion is extremely close
They still do
At least 45% of the time
Oof
I mean, we usually hate Brazilian dubs on movies, but not that much on anime
The DBZ brazilian dub is great, for example
Here in Portugal they are very stricted and somewhat stupid, first you can't get a gun that easy which I think it's good
If you have an intruder in your house and you want to defend yourself you can only hurt him like in the front so eg
You have a knife and you stab the guy in the stomach that could be considered self defense but if he had is back turn to you it wouldn't because it means he wasn't attacking you
But the most ridiculous thing is they will not arrest the guy unless they catch him in the act, we were robbed a couple years ago during the night and my brother was in the living room playing ps the guy walked in and my brother started to yell my father came running but the guy jumped out of the window then my brother went to the station to identify the guy he identified one but the police can't arrest him because they didn't see him there
My understanding from what my Krav Maga instructor once told me, in Portugal, the law surrounding self defense pretty much only allow for killing if the victim is in a position of absolutely no other choice and is exposed, like being in the bathroom and nowhere else is killing well justified
Outside, in the public space, there's some basic rules, by law, to sort of diffuse harmful contact as much as possible, say, not going straight to the face if violence is imminent but once it's on, it's on and basically short of killing the perpetrator, all contact is somewhat justified
Firearms are pretty much illegal unless it's a hunting rifle, blunt objects are regulated, so it better be the absolute mother of necessity to use them
Shitty, gives the impression that the intruder will almost allways profit from the situation
If anyone broke into my house and I beat the shit out of them I doubt that I wouldnt be in trouble
Yes
[Guarda Nacional Republicana (GNR)] is a military police that works in rural areas
Major cities are under the jurisdiction of [Policia de Segurança Pública (PSP)] which is non-military
A bit unrelated, but very interesting, is the case of Brazil, for two reasons
First  they have a military police that is called
"Military Police" (Polícia Militar), and each state has its own, and they operate in cities two, like in Rio de Janeiro, which brings me to my second point  of interest, which is the movie "Tropa de Elite", a must-see Brazilian movie about an elite branch of this police squad and the drug trade in the city
Its truly a great saga, and I recommend it to anyone
I don't think either of our police forces are military
While GNR is more common in rural areas, they also exist in the major cities
And vice-versa
PSP also acts in rural areas
I don't think so
Some differences might exist on paper, but on everyday life they are similar
The word "Sacana" comes from the Japanese "Sakana", meaning fish
In Portuguese means "sneaky bastard".
The story goes when the Portuguese arrived in Japan, the Japanese called us Sakana, because we came from the sea and had big eyes
The Portuguese thought it meant something else and started calling each other "Sacana".
Example: "Seu sacana de um raio": "You goddamn sneaky weasel".
One that comes to mind is the word *pergaminho*. It means *scroll* in Portuguese
One time during History class our lecturer was talking about the ancient Greek city of Pergamon (now situated in modern day Turkey) and how it was famous for its production of parchment, when all of a sudden I put two and two together in my brain and ask if that's where the word *pergaminho* comes from then
He said I was right and that I had made a good observation, which made me feel like a smartass for the rest of the day
We also have that one in Portuguese, but it's spelled oxalá.
So first in the formative years we learn about the predecessor of all things that would later influence the politics and future events, so we start normally with the Greeks then the Romans and the iberian tribes with the especially place for the lusitanos (the ancestors of the Portuguese), we also study the Phoenicians since they were here in iberia with the Greeks and later the Romans
Then actual history of the country first the political climate of the reconquista and how the country was formed (the history of our first King was really badass i recommend people reading it you will enjoy it) then the military exploits against other reconquista kingdoms and the moors kingdoms, the expansion, Portugal was the first to end its territorial expansion in 1200s having the oldest consistent boarders in Europe (and that's a big achievement considering European history), we also study about the British and their help during the reconquista and against the other kingdoms that then lead to the creation of oldest alliance in the world still active (Portugal and England alliance), then we study the dynasties in general sense and giving special attention to the most important monarchs and their achievements (a good way to remember was by their cognome which is basically a nickname given to the king or queen an their deeds for example D. Pedro the I had the cognome of the "o justiceiro" = the just (more like the punisher) tldr he loved a girl but the king and the Royals didn't like, they got her killed by buying killers, when he became king he brought the killers to justice made them kiss the hand of his dead lover corpse, and later they were executed, he also crown the corpse because she was his true love and so she deserved to be his queen), we also learn about important events that shape our history and global and European history like our sea adventures, colonialism, slavery, the Lisbon earthquake that literally changed European philosophy and architecture, we learn about the development of technology advancement in automation like the printing press and fabric we learn about the lousy deals that our monarch had with the British that destroyed our economy and industry for literally centuries, we also learn about the French revolution since it was the turning point of modern history, a bit about the American history, the French inventions and our success at beating them and defending our ground, then the events of the 19 and 20 centuries
We have to squeeze this all there's no real alternative either you learn it or not, now we don't study every war and its fine details just a general view on the matter and a few important events, also this is given in multiple years so its like you are studying this from the early grades until the 12 grade, so for example in the 12 grade you mainly study the event from 18th to 20th century with a bit of old information from previous years
Also other classes like Portuguese we study a bit of history through literature like the book lusíadas or the works from Pessoa and the context of his environment etc
To add before learning all this we are taught the history of evolutionary fases of men and its tribes and tools and stuff
Interesting reads
Pedro the first the just
The founding King of Portugal
Lisbon earthquake:
U can't fit 300 years
That's barely history m8
Very nicely put
Just add some paragraphs so it's easier on the eye n to read ofc
Yes, we learned that the hard way
In Portugal you finish high school/start university when you are 17/18
For example this year seniors/ uni freshman were born in 2003
In Portugal most people I know do this:
4 years of elementary school  usually starts when you are 6/5
With portuguese, math, PE, music, a subject which teaches about history, geography and the human body
2+3 years of midle school
Basicly the same subjects, plus history, geography, biology and geology, physics and chemistry and a 3rd language (usually french/spanish/german)
Then you either go to a vocacional school or regular high school
In high school you can choose 1 of 3 diferent "themes" according  to what you want to study in university: ciences, humanities or art
Normally high school ends when you are 18/17
Most who go to regular high school want to go to university
Same thing in Portugal
It's so weird calling them that tbh
We start at 6 and should finish 12 years later
At 18 you should be entering college
Ya they are just “alunos do 12°”
And freshmen are "caloiros" :)
In Portugal it is 4 years of elementary school, 5 years of middle school and 3 years of high school
In Portugal it had great coverage when the things were at it's peak
Usually it opened almost every news program, and had enormous coverage
Nowadays, due to COVID-19, BLM, national news and other recent events, it gets a bit overshadowed
There are some news here and there, but it definitely hasn't the same coverage it had
I feel like the portuguese population in general has a sense of sympathy towards the cause, mainly due to history, as resisting spanish attempts to rule Portugal is a big part of our history
I don't really share the sympathy thowords an independent Catalonia including most people I talk to but it's hard to say where the majority stands
I see it as an appeal to populist movements which cause more divide than justice to the people
History should had nothing to do with it
Our feud with Spain ended a long time ago and it's in the past, we should instead embrace our common history and heritage
In my opinion, the best would be a fair referendum
Letting the people decide
If the majority wants independence, then they should have it, but if the majority doesn't want independence, then Catalonia should remain part of Spain
Vila Nova de Gaia
Located in Portugal on the south side of the Douro river oposite to Oporto ( Second largest city in Portugal)
On this ground an ancient Celtic settlement  existed  called 'calle or galle'.
By the time the Romans came, it turned to Gale
On the north side of the river,  a port for the settlement  was buit know as ' portuscale' or Port of Cale
When the muslim invaded Iberia the river became the border and the settlement was abandoned
As Christians fled to the north side the Port became it's  own settlement,  know today as Oporto
But the Area retained  the name 'Portuscale '.
When the reconquista kick started the father of the first king of Portugal was given the duchy of Portucale and the settlement after the souther conquests of territory the area was settled  again, this time gale was now pronounced  gaia and the area was renamed Vila Nova de Gaia ( New Town of Gaia )
So my town was the name sake of my contry ! XD
No one really knows where Silves comes from
All that we know is that the place is inhabited since pre-historic times
The first registered name for the city comes from the phoenicians, who called it Cilpes or Cilbes
This name was also used by the romans and everyone else until the muslim invasions, when it became known as Xilb
When Portugal conquered the city, the name Silves became official
As you can see the name didn't change that much throughout history
The thing is, no one knows where it comes from to begin with
It is thought that the name Cilpes comes from the  Cilibitani or Cibilitani, as Pliny mentions the existence of a oppida stipendiaria with this name in nowadays Portugal
Avienus mentioned in his Ora Maritima a river named Cilbus, where the Cilbiceni lived
But once again, we only know these people lived in Lusitania, we don't know exactly where they were from
However, it is also thought that this name could have originated Quelfes, a town some 60 Km away from Silves
We also know that modern Silves was relocated
The original settlement was some two kilometres further down the river
However, despite knowing that the city existed during Roman times, it does not appear in any records of Ptolemy
Furthermore, the only indications that we have of the romans in the city are some bowls, a roman villa, some busts and a statue of Jupiter with some coins
We also know that Cilpis produced coins, as roman currency has been found with the name Cilpis
All in all, the name possibly comes from a tribe living there, but no one can say for sure where the city's name comes from
Agualva, a town in Lisbon, Portugal
The name was given after the quality of the little river that crosses it
The name is a conjunction of Agua (water) + Alva (clear or pure)
Edit: It dates back to even before our first king
Viseu (viso eu) I see in English
It comes from the fact that its located in a high place and Viriato the leader of a lusitanian tribe could see the Romans and fight them of
He was a real life Asterix because everywhere else was conquered but he fought them off until he was betrayed and assassinated
He is one of our national heros
I live near Horta, a city in the Azores which got its name from the first donatary captain of the island of Faial, where the city is now located, Joss van Hürter, a belgian settler
The portuguese language led to the "aportuguesation" of the name, leading to Horta
His surname also changed later from "van Hürter" to "de Utra" to "D'Utra" and finally "Dutra" which is my surname
Lisboa comes from Olissipo
Olissipo is the Phoenician word for safe harbor
This name Olissipo, is more than 3000 years old
The city is even older
Taking this thread as the Portugal thread:
"Coimbra" comes from "Conimbriga", which since the -briga suffix was used to refer to settlements and there was a tribe around called the "Conii", thus giving it the name
Dropping the "n" between vowels is a very common phenomenon in Portuguese linguistic history
Oddly enough, Conimbriga was a different closeby roman settlement a bit into the interior (of which the ruins are still there and very much a must-visit), whereas the current town of Coimbra is located in a hill by the Mondego river bank halfway between Lisbon and Porto, where walls were built and where most of the reconquista was headquartered from, was initially called Aeminium
It was a much smaller Roman outpost, but it still has some Roman sewers atop the hill
From what I read the Cale was in fact what is now Porto
More specifically the castro where now Porto's nucleus is, Sé.
The theory of Portus cale having to do with Gaia's castle doesn't have archeological and historical standing, even in celtic and late roman times the Cale is described as being on the edge of Callaecia
Seeing that the frontier with Lusitania was the Douro river it Cale is Porto
Hello fellow Portuguese, pls refrain from using Oporto, thanks bye and have a bom dia
Well i read that on Wikipedia  so I must be right
Ahahha
yeah, it's  quite possible you are right
Like i said, in my case its Wikipedia  knowledge
In Portuguese: *Ronrom*.
The verb *to purr* translates to *ronronar*.
"The cat is purring
" translates to «O gato está a ronronar
Purr for sound
Ronronar, verb
Eu acho que ele está a perguntar a onomatopeia, que seria *rrrrrr* certo
É _ronrom_, pelo menos fui ensinado na escola que era esse o termo
It depends on the subjects, but according to the rankings it's (with no specific order) Universidade do Porto, Universidade de Lisboa, Universidade de Coimbra, Universidade Nova de Lisboa
They're all public
Uhm, Ubi from covilha, the one in porto, Coimbra and Castelo branco have really nicest, but the hardest to join is Porto and Lisbon (Portugal btw)
Minho University
Universidade de Coimbra
Já não estamos na idade média
Ahhaahahaha
You sound pretty biased there
Literally never heard anything about IPCB and UBI is arguably still behind the big 4
Ah like, I'm don't know a lot of university's in Portugal, sorry if I'm wrong, just tried to answer I guess :/, the university that I know better it's Ubi cuz I live in Covilhã
Hard for any university to overtake ULisboa, Nova (central location in a country very dependent on Lisbon), Porto (same thing but in the north) and Coimbra (old and prestigious), to be honest
True, but Ubi in a gud spot tho, but lisboa, Porto and Coimbra are the bests
In our epic poem, the Lusiads, there are water nymphs in the Tagus River called the Tágides
And according to the poem, the reason the Cape of Storms was filled with storms was because of a Giant named [Adamastor] who was banished there after falling in love with Thetis, one of the nereids, heartbroken because of his unrequited love, now appearing out of a storm cloud and threatening to ruin anyone hardy enough to attempt passing the Cape and penetrate the Indian Ocean, which was Adamastor's domain
Adamastor became the spirit of the Cape of Storms, a hideous phantom of unearthly pallor
Vasco da Gama asks the beast who he is and after Adamastor tells him his life story, the Giant calms down and lets them through - thus the Cape of Storms is renamed Cape of Good Hope
Well not exactly, although from what i know our ancestors before the roman invasions had a strong nature base pantheon and myth, it was most lost with Time do to the aggressive roots of Christianity
In interior regions of Portugal there are some pagan  worshipping and pagan myths some what alive, some times the population doesn't really understand that they are doing pagan stuff or are aware that they are doing pagan rituals
to them they are just following tradition and aren't really aware of its roots
>People in South America and Africa tend to be more into their Christianity now than Europeans are yet folk beliefs are still pretty strong across those continents
I don't know that religiosity necessarily means discarding folklore
Here's the thing by the times Europeans started to colonisation of this places the approach was different, for example the ability to have written records were greatly available starting around the 15 century do to the pressing machines, we know that some priest that were in the colonies normally would take records of the conversions with natives and this includes myths and religious, we also that the colonisers only control the costal area and only around the 18 century that stated to advance the interior regions
This factors provided the ability to the native culture to survive
In opposition the conquest by the Romans and reconquista by the European forces of the Iberian peninsula cause it to suffer from 4 magor culture shifts that destroyed a lot of the natives culture, one was the roman faith, then early Christianity, Islam, medieval Christianity, there's also almost no records that describe the natives culture
the extreme views of medieval Christianity on paganism and the methods used to destroy or incorporate it into the religion were extremely cruel and destroyed a lot of culture, although the Christianity that reached the colonies was extreme it was also moderated in comparison to the early medieval Christianity
We are also less religious than them because we also had a stronger influence from the racional thinkers of Europe of 17 and 18 centuries
So there's a lot of factors that led to the destruction of our ancestors culture
>England experienced invasion and cultural disruption from Rome, the Anglo-Saxons, re-conversion to Christianity in the Dark Ages, and then the Protestant Reformation
And we still have folklore
but by that time the printing press was just invented, the events that happen in the peninsula was much more extreme than england, especialy  rome dominance, and older than before the printing press
> Which Britain and Germany (for example) went through, yet we still have plenty of folklore
i was refering to the differance in religion belife leves and not the folklore
> Which were present in other countries like Germany, which still has plenty of recorded folklore
you know that inquisition was always presente in the iberian regions and they censure anything that wasn't christian and that after the split of christianity in to catholic and Protestant the kingdoms that form germany stoped being censure by the church, while portugal and spain were censure culturaly by the inquisition untly around the 18th
Also we do have folklore, but not from our ancient ancestors, we have more recent folklore from recent history around 800 years ago like the baker woman of Aljubarrota, witches
There are a few, and i mean a few, remaining pagan and celtic traditions/rituals but only existe in remote areas and the people who perform it don't know their origins they only know it has a tradition
The bride leaving her groom at the altar after her love interest opposes the marriage and they run off together
I mean, they could do it (though we don't have the part where people are asked if they oppose the wedding), but there would be so much backlash later they would never be welcome in that town or their families again
You covered pretty much everything
Apparently in USA you can even change your surnames
I don't know anyone who has changed their names
It's a bit rude to ask directly, but I guess you can say something if you can't understand the other person, although I have rarely seen it (a teacher of mine said it to a student from Azores)
I will, in conversations with people who may have difficulties understanding me, soften my accent and make the pronounciation clearer (properly say "v" instead of turning them into "b", for example, or softening the "ão" sound)
> Friulano has plurals in s
The way it should be
Eh, my experience in Spain is that Spanish people don't give a fuck if you don't understand them :D
Italian just stands out compared to the major western romance languages as it doesn't form the plural in a s. Although French is a bit more complex (surprise
) than Portuguese or Spanish

Wrapped in dough
I don't know
But if you want an equivalent for dumplings, maybe [Pastél de Bacalhau] It's pieces of boiled cod fish, with some herbs, involved in mash potato and then fried
Other than this, I don't think we have something more like a dumpling specific to us only
We eat Ravioli
EDIT: I'm sorry, I forgot about other (better) examples:
[Rissol] Typically filled with shrimp and sauce or meat
[Empada] Filled with chicken and some herbs
[Empanadilha] Filled with a sauce with tuna or chicken
We have the [rissol] and it’s the best thing ever
It can be filled with meat or shrimp or fish, and it’s deep fried afterward
We bring them to picnics, serve miniatures at birthday parties and are a common option for a quick lunch (usually every café has them)
Viva o rissol
Rissol, man
O meu pequeno almoço preferido é mais que qualificado para este post: [Pastel de Chaves]
I love them
In Portugal we can easily find tortellinis in supermarkets, they're delicious
Didn’t know that
Canja (Chicken soup) with pasta or with rice
I would say in Portugal either Sagres or Super Bock
And we all know the best is super bock tho
(different beers)
TIL some people make canja with rice
What kind of heathen taints Canja by putting rice in it
Southerners do
I know, it's strange
I heard they even throw pepermint leaves on it
I've had peppermint leaves on canja de galinha with pasta
It's honestly pretty good
Since I live in the "center" region my "canja" often varies between rice and pasta, somedays with pasta
somedays with rice
Strange
Rice is the only way to eat "Canja". Eating it with pasta brings our country back to the middle ages
That's not possible
You have to choose one side
You can't live in a grey area
When the "Canjada: Portuguese civil war" begins, you have to choose one of parties
Norway, I would love to roadtrip from south to north so bad
Italy for sure
It just seems like such a rich country in terms of history, culture, and cuisine
The language itself is also very aesthetic, and I really appreciate the abundance of different regional dialects
And it looks beautiful, both in terms of natural landscapes as well as in architecture
Of course I know there's more to the country than that
I try not to see things from rose-tinted glasses, but despite that the country looks super appealing to me
I had the chance to visit Venice and Rome, but I would love to do a tour of the whole country
The Netherlands for me
I love the language, I find the people extremely beautiful and attractive, I love how direct they are, I love the landscape and the animals that origin from there, I like the food I've tried from there, tulips are my favourite flower, etc etc
I have no relations to anything or anyone there, I'm just in love with it
The United States, it's just a result of all the movies and tv shows that we see that take place there
I feel the same
I generally quite like the weather here, but sometimes I really want to be somewhere that's green and somewhat "gloomy".
Now I'm reminded of [this] lmao
We may be small but there is a great variety in culture and landscapes, allow me to recommend you the north of the country for your next visit
In Norway I would like to go to Bergen and the Lofoten Islands at least
National one
I am portuguese
And usually when travelling Portuguese is seen as a friendly, non threatening, non filthy-rich nationality and hardly anybody has a grudge against Portugal except Brazil and maybe North Korea
PELA (contraction of por+a) glória da união, fyi

But if we had it would go like this:
**Cabeça**, **Ombros**, **Joelhos** e **Dedos dos Pés** (x2)
E **Olhos** e **Orelhas** e **Boca** e **Nariz**
Cabeça, Ombros, Joelhos e Dedos dos Pés
We have it

We are lazy and prefer to sun bath because our parents pay us the bills until we're in our 30s.
Honestly, we don't have a lot of industries moving in and people creating decent well paying jobs
Lots of corruption as well which makes taxes go higher to be able to sustain public services and pay for the corruption and inefficient political decisions
Companies not paying enough for people to go to work and pay their bills (due to taxation, going to work barely makes any cash for you to pay your expenses of going to work and keep yourself fed for a month)
Nepotism, a lot of it
No advantages to actually work, if you do work you'll get incredibly taxed even if it's minimum wage, so people just work "under the table" or don't work at all and become immigrants
If you work a lot, depending on the company, you might be fired because you've finished your job way before the time the company was expecting it so you need to keep it going
There's a list of other issues, but from what I'm seeing on this thread, other people from the south seem to have pointed them out as well
To sum up: We're poor but we are beatiful and have sun
I agreed with everything except yout attack on independentists
It's your fault they exist
You handled them with arrogance because you promised to give them more autonomy and then never did so obviously they got upset
Also if you hadn't suppress their election with police force and arrested their leaders like they are some sort of criminals probably the issue would have been contained
I wasn't very favourable of the Catalunha cause until I saw you send armed police officers beat on unarmed innocent citizens who just wanted to vote
That turned me in favor of their cause
The only thing I don't understand is why they are still not like  basques and started bombing Spain after the humiliations they endured
They sure are a peaceful patient people
Minimum wage gets 11% taxes
The taxes become higher because of our progressive IRS taxing system
If big companies companies paid their fair share of taxes workers wouldn't have to pay as much
Go away Iniciativa Liberal guy
no dude
all the Mediterranean countries count, and portugal
Yes some of us go abroad to get better jobs
Others prefer to stay and suffer because our country is fucking amazing (asides from job conditions)
I consider going abroad but i hope I am not forced to stay more than 2-3 yrs away from my country
The ideal would be to get a remote job
I would like to travel a lot and know different realities but one thing is travelling and being able to come back whenever you get tired, other thing is being forced to live in a country with no sun
️ At least they have blondies in those countries and i like blondies and gingers
Lol
Thank you french person
I love your frontality
I am not a very patient person
If you know the law and know how to complain things get done
I don't like the inneficiency of public services (also private companies are inneficient as well sometimes) but it has been improving
I guess it is a price you pay for being able to have so much sun in a nice peaceful country
About languishing my life away, job wise I do get what you mean, that's why I intend to go abroad
But I think I will always come back to my country and if I buy a house it will be here not elsewhere
I never used any drugs
I have wiser ways to spend my money
And you think 11% on a wage below 800 is ok for alright, fair enough
The problem isent companies, you have small companies opening in Spain and working here because you get less taxation in some cases, charging even more doesn't make them come back
But, suit yourself
So the problem is the existence of countries who do fiscal dumping
With a unified european fiscal policy that wouldn't happen

Oh yeah, I forgot that little gem
I believe that a foreigner should vote for election's that directly involves him
For example in Portugal a foreign (independent of is country of origin) should be able to vote except for the president
A president in our Constitution has a representative role and not so much a politic role so he's there to represent the Portuguese people with born or acquired nationality
So he should be able to vote in general elections for the parliament
Yes, in here some foreign residents can vote, they must be registered to vote and belong to one of these countries: Brazil, Cape Verde, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Iceland, Norway,  New Zealand, Peru, Uruguay, Venezuela and, of course, all EU countries
Edit: sorry, that applies only to local elections, for the general and presidential ones, they aren’t allowed to vote, except Brazilians with residence in our country
If they are residents and Not from the USA why not
Has many people already pointed, it is unfair that a person (from the EU) living in a foreign country for decades cannot make their voice heard in the democratic process, while someone who's a national and had barely set foot in their home country, can
Some people are mentioning conscription as well
I think the only major requisite for obtaining voting rights is being fluent in the language of the country
People, national born or not, should make a language, history and political system test before being able to vote
If you're from another EU country and have been living in Portugal for several years, and pass this theoretical test, you should be able to vote, citizenship or not
Being born in a country should not automatically give you a special status nor should it bind you
If you love a country, its language, people and culture, then you're a citizen already
The rest is beaurocracy
A national of your country that lives and work in another country Vs a foreign that lives and work in your country
who do you think that have more commitment to your country
If you're a legit tax payer why should you be descriminated and have less rights than a person that don't pay taxes in your country

"Resvés campo de Ourique "
Almost hit campo de Ourique (it's an expression that comes from 1755 from the time of great Lisbon earthquake/fire/tsunami, a great portion of the city got completely obliterated and destruction just barely miss campo de Ourique
So it's basically a way of saying it was closed call)
I can sort of get by in Spain, but only by speaking a mixture of Portuguese and Spanish
I can understand around 70% when reading Spanish, but having a conversation is harder
Galicia is the easiest region for us Portuguese speakers, due to how closely related our languages are
When I went to Rome a few years ago I thought I wouldn't need to resort to English, but I grossly overestimated my communication skills
In my experience, it's tremendously easy to travel in spain, without using any english
Spanish is closest to Portuguese but I only got by in Galicia, with Spaniards from Madrid I was asked to speak in English
There's a big sign saying "Welcome to Spain" and under it someone scribbled "Galiza is not Spain" (I've only crossed it in the north) and that's it
[Completely painless] just like any other road
There are two nearby points where I can cross "officially" into Spain, both of them without any type of control whatsoever
You just go by a sign and puff, you're in Spain
Additionally, outside of the rainy season, when the small rivers and streams run again and can be difficult (or even impossible) to pass, there's plenty of points accessible by dirt roads where I could just drive (or even walk) into Spain without anyone even noticing (in fact, some of these points were used for contraband routes, during the dictatorship)
It's pretty painless, but there's this huge orange filter that overlays the landscape all of a sudden
Weird
I wouldn't notice any difference if it wasn't for the 'España' sign on the right side of the highway
It's a loooooong story
What is your wallpaper image (desktop, tablet, smartphone)
Just curious to know what people have as their wallpaper image
I'm mostly asking about what wallpaper you have on your computer, but tablet and smartphone wallpapers are also welcome
My current wallpaper is a [screenshot of a scene] from Studio Ghibli's [Porco Rosso] A lot of scenes in Ghibli films make for great wallpapers, but I chose this one in particular because it reminded of some old traditional cafés you can still find in some parts of Portugal, though the movie itself mostly takes place in Istria (between WWI and WWII iirc)
There's actually [another scene] I nearly chose to use as a wallpaper image, one that reminds me of some the beaches over here, but in the end I went with the former
Anime shit in all of them
I don't think I should share that, to be honest
I really like the laptop one as a wallpaper
Yeah I still have the default wallpaper on my Galaxy S8
When I first got it I tried a lot of different pics but didn't like any of them as a wallpaper and so I just left it as is
Been like that for 2 years now haha
Love the atmosphere of that painting
That train picture is amazing
Kamurocho <3
Princess Mononoke might be my favourite out of all the Ghibli films
I'm surprised I never knew about Erté before
Love his style
I've yet to watch Pom Poko
A few years back I decided to watch Kiki's Delivery Service one Christmas, and ever since then I've watched a Ghibli movie every Christmas
Last Christmas I watched Only Yesterday for the first time
I also have a theatrical poster of The Wind Rises framed on my wall, which I managed to get from the local cine-theatre a few years back

"My name is Yoshikage Kira
I'm 33 years old
My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married

I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink
I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what
After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning
Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning
I was told there were no issues at my last check-up
I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life
I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night
That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness
Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone

Seasonal jokes about the Portuguese immigrants in France
About how they dress, how they have weird stickers and stuff on the car, how stubborn they are about speaking in Portuguese when they can't speak it anymore
England, France and Spain, as in "An English, a French and Spaniard walk into a bar
" sort of jokes
Also North Americans and Brazilians, though those are rare nowadays
A Portuguese a Frenchman and a Brit enter a bar
We have some jokes on France and England
All of them start like this: Um português, um inglês e um francês (...)
There are also many jokes regarding Spain (of course)
I think France
Maybe (._. )
France and Spain mostly
Lots of jokes about ourselves, and about spain and france
It's alright
We have plenty of jokes about you guys too
and Spanish people don't forget the classics
[O EMIGRANTE] (I'd like some French reactions to this)
Always saw the French ones as the classics
People in Portugal never liked much the Spanish but I always heard more jokes about the avecs than anything else
I know one, but it might be a bit offensive:
In China were a Portuguese, an American and a Spaniard
They were having a drink in the main square, but they didn't know that in China this is forbidden and so they were caught in the act and arrested
The next day they were sent to the jailer to receive their sentence
The jailer told them that they would receive 30 lashes as punishment
Except, as China was in transition between the year of the dog and the year of the rat, so each prisoner would be entitled to one request, he says:
\- You American
What is your wish, provided it is not to escape punishment
The American answers:
\- I want a pillow tied to my back
\- So be it
And take the lashes with the pillow on your back
- Says the Chinese
By the fifteenth lash, the pillow gave way and the American took 15 lashes
Turning to Spaniard, he says:
\- It's your turn, Spaniard
What is your wish
The Spaniard answers:
\- Tie two pillows on my back
And so it was
By the twenty-fifth whipping, the pillows gave way and the Spaniard caught five of the 30 lashes
But he was happy because he outsmarted the American
It was the Portuguese's turn
Says the Chinese:
\- Well, well, you're Portuguese
Let's get this over with, what is your wish
And says the Portuguese:
\- Tie the Spaniard on my back
Haha xD
No heating in my house, because, you know, this is sunny Portugal and apparently people think it's normal to freeze in apartments during winter
Also, my apartment has low sun exposure and is set on a last floor
So, right now, we have a whopping 16 degrees Celsius and I am freezing to death
And yes, I have thermal underwear, also a merino jumper and a thick wool jacket and socks
But warming up is very tough for me, due to a medical condition, so here I am, frozen
And two hours ago the temp was at 15, so
Probably around 20C, probably less right now because I had the windows open a few minutes ago to air the room
I wear a sweater inside
I would say my house is slightly warmer than outside, like 14-15ºC, because we don't use heating inside
I guess is not a common practice here in Portugal given that we have 3-4 months of cold weather (around 10ºC)
For example, I had a polish exchange student in my classroom at university complaining about how cold ir was inside the room
Even in public spaces with heating the temperature normally isn't above 17-18ºC.
15C. It's way too cold but I guess it's normal around here
Heating is a luxury
This is one the portuguese issues that put us like a 3 world country, saldly
If the energy prices were adjusted to the purchase power, we wouldn't have this issue but yeah we have one of the most overpriced energy prices in Europe
It's surprising to me that in Northern Europe you have your houses so hot (23º)
But also have seen people from Northern Europe saying that 26-27º outside is really hot
That's so weird and I can't understand
In Portugal no one has a house that hot,16,5-20 should be the most common
Same
I can feel the pain
My experience is new construction is super efficient to react to lessons learned from inefficiency of older stock
For example many places we looked at were called ‘gemini-ed’, two houses with a common wall; lots of insulation; solar water heated systems
All places for sale seem to get energy rated, maybe it’s a rule (?)
Physicist spotted
Yeah I have no heating at home so it gets quite cold in winter
>In Portugal no one has a house that hot,16,5-20 should be the most common
&#x200B;
Look at the rich guy
Yes, it is known
Everybody from colder climates that arrive here in winter say the same thing
AC is also considered a luxury
To my Portuguese brain, I don't even know how you Canadian survive your winters, I personally have never experienced negative Celsius (I guess once I got to - 1) and, well, let's just say that that day wasn't a good day for me
TIL (and I kind of want one now)
I'm glad you are an optimistic person, unlike me
Things have improved, and yes, there is an energy rating that is required to sell houses
However, my cynical person thinks that constructors will cheat as much as they can
Oh the stories I have heard
I have a friend that is a civil engineer, and really, there are things that he told me that I wish I didn't know
We do have electric heaters, however, most people hardly use them, because our electric bills go through the roof
I think that at this point people are just so used to the cold, that they get home, and dress to stay in house, thick coat or robe, pijamas, a throw when you are on your coach
Showering: you just take a really hot shower and then when you finish reluctantly turn the tap off and dry yourself as fast as you can, and that's it (mind you that our winters aren't that cold, 10 degrees Celsius is considered very cold, around here)
Let me tell you, if drying fast could be a sport, we would be world champions
(I do own an electric heater on the bathroom, and it has saved my frozen life
There are stricter regulations than 50 years ago, but construction companies will try to circumvent those as much as possible, so in the end new buildings will still have crap insulation and mold issues
lol I was going to say 14-18 but the other Portuguese comment said 20, and I was like OK maybe people have house a lot hotter than I thought
Right now it's 16 in my room
That's exactly what happens here
If it gets colder just put another blanket and put up with it
No heating and isolation sucks
Yeah, even new house and flats don't have great isolation and old house are terrible for the most part
We are far behind most European countries
Summers without AC are tough, especially when 30 is considered a normal summer day
Well, 35 is a normal summer day,around here
Of course, it depends on where you live precisely in Portugal
Up north is colder
But let me tell you, 15 degrees in a home
Not comfortable
It's mild for the vast majority of the territory and the year, the logic here is that we have good weather so we don't need heating, truth is that when people from Nordic countries come here in the winter, they say they have never been colder indoors
I think new buildings are much more isolated tho
But many people live in older houses
yeah, it's 11 outside and no more than 15 In my house
I am changing windows soon but that's only part of the problem
This ️ I don't live in Portugal now but I was always freezing indoors even though the temperature wasn't that cold
Now I live in the UK and having heating and better insulation makes all the difference
Winter is must easier to deal with now
We don't really do that here
If anything we'd rather adopt a English loanwords instead
Pretty much
At most, we might adapt said loan word and apply Portuguese grammar/ortographic rules to it, namely when we need to use it as verbs ("postar", "tweetar", etc)
As always, direct translation in Portuguese: "vergonha alheia".
...that has been around since forever
And it has an equivalent in every language
Town of 150
Completely safe, on summer I'll walk the dog at 1am and I won't even see a single car
Lived in Lisbon for 6 years
I would go out for drinks with my friends and come back home at 4am with absolutely no problem
It was a 30 minute walk and I am a woman
Always felt extremely safe in Lisbon
Lisboa-I'm a womanand several times walk after work, around 23h/24h in the middle of the city never felt insecure
Portugal is a safe place
I live in Lisboa
I'm female, 54
I feel uneasy outside at night but, in all the years living in Lisboa, no stranger ever attacked me, except for some catcalling
yeah with 150 people even during the day it would be difficult to find anyone ;)
I actually found Edinburgh to be super safe at night
I'd walk most of the time and never felt particularly vulnerable, although the meadows did look a bit dodgy at times
Does your country have a "national" musical instrument
I put national in quotes because it doesn't necessarily need to be formally taken as "the national instrument". Maybe it's just an instrument that's deeply associated with a quintessential music genre from your country
If so, do you like how it sounds
What kind of music uses it
Care to share a nice song
For example, for Portugal it's the [Portuguese Guitar] If you ever been to Portugal, chances are you heard this sound, it's very omnipresent
Together with the vocals and the classic guitar, it forms the essence of our national music genre  [Fado]
I like the sound of the guitar, but I don't really like Fado
> I like the sound of the guitar, but I don't really like Fado
If it's the singing that puts you off, you can always check out Carlos Paredes (especially because he composed the piece you posted)
It's Coimbra fado, not Lisbon fado, and it's not sung, so it's less melodramatic, I find
Not just the portuguese guitar, I would argue the cavaquinho is also our national music instrument
And influential to other instruments elsewhere
An example
I am not sure if someone already made this comment, but we also have the [cavaquinho]
That one in the picture
It's a Portuguese guitar
There's a kind of pipe up north, it looks like a Scottish pipe
This actually sounds quite awesome
Now I get the Guinness symbol :)
Well, yes
When I hear accordion I usually think Amelie and crunchy, hot baguette
But accordion is actually Romanian, right
Isn't the band Wardruna from Norway
They made the soundtrack for the series Vikings
I think they sing old poems and such
They also use traditional instruments, no
They are the most awesome folk band I know
The Langspil sounds right for Iceland
I can feel the cold and the Viking through the sound of that thing
Yeah, I know Carlos Paredes
Only shared this video of a cover because the guitar is playing solo
I actually like Coimbra Fado
Saw it live once in Coimbra, one summer night
The students were playing on the streets
It was really awesome
Fado corrido is also great, because I usually burst laughing until my body hurts
When I think of German music, I think of big orchestras, and operas
I would never think of the accordion
Maybe it just be a matter of perception, but you seem to have your own signature of classic music
I know
My dad has one, and I've been trying to play it ever since I was a child
Never could
My dad can though
it's also on their Euro coins
Probably November 1st, 1755
All saints day, a holiday, there was a major earthquake far away in the Gorringe bank, where the european and north african plates crash, so earthquake, tsunami and a fire broke out and destroyed a lot of the city
For the memory the city at least that was the most relevant in recent-ish times, for relevance I think we had some revolutions and stuff around so maybe the 1974 revolution or the 1910 implantation of the republic (a lot of major stuff happens in or quite close to Terreiro do Paço or Rua do Arsenal)
It was in my city that the borders in continental Portugal finally came to be, in 1249, with the conquest of the city of Faro, and the moorish Kingdom of the Algarve, by portuguese king Afonso III
My region (the Algarve) was a de jure separate kingdom up until 1910, and a lot of our cultural traits can still be traced back to moroccan/moorish culture, as we were under their influence for a lot longer than the rest of the country
I have read a official Portuguese translation of Mein Kampf in the early 2000's. This doesn't seem very accurate
Constipation - Constipação (In English it means the opposite of a diarrhea but in portuguese it's just a flu)
Parentes - Parentes (In English it means mom and dad, but in portuguese it works for your whole family, the same as relative)
What you are saying is what we call "False Friends"
Pushar means Pull, and since Pushar is so close to Push doors are hard for me to understand
Not exactly an English word per se, but there's that relatively new car model named Kona, which in Portuguese (just change the k for a c) is slang for
lady bits
They had to change the name here to Kauai
Imagine my reaction when I saw the ad in English
"Puxe" sounds exactly like "push" but means "pull"
I've actually got into a cringey situation because of this
A little after the song "Ordinary Love" appeared, I searched what "Ordinary" meant
It meant "something normal". But what I didn't search, was the translation, and boy I should've
Because in Portuguese, ordinário, a rather similar word, means perv
So you can imagine the look on my friend when I told them I was a perv in the subway
We also use smoking
With makes no sense since it does not sound like a Portuguese word
The word "ordinário" can have the same meaning as the English word in Portuguese
You can use that word to refer to something that is usual
This word is the opposite of "extraordinário" (extraordinary in English), which means something unusual, uncommon
Most people use the word "ordinário" with the meaning of perv tho
Ohhhhhhhhhhhjhhh thank you
It's funny until a friend of mine, who bought a pack of mint scent Kleenex, scared an Erasmus student to death when he said that was the best for his constipation  still laugh until this day
The look on her face was incredible
I'm a Brit living in Portugal
I've been here a few years now and although I am conversational my grasp on the language is shaky at times and there's a lot of words I don't know
A lot of the time you can make an educated guess and get the right answer but sometimes that leads you astray
Not so long ago I was in the village cafe, as you do, to have a cafe
I was talking to one of the local lasses and when I asked her how she was (*tudo bem
*) she told me she had constipation
I was taken aback that she would share that with me and was lost for words
She just shrugged and walked off like it was nothing
I was so horrified I went straight home after my coffee and told my wife
We both had a good chuckle
Now it all makes sense
Edit: PS: Consumption was called consumption because of the weight loss associated with the disease
Tuberculosis literally consumed your body until you died
Respect
That's all you need
Have some social awareness
Look around and understand the environment
Europe is very diverse and you can find yourself in all kinds of situations
As long as you are open minded and respectful you won't annoy anyone
I understand European cities are cool and have a lot of history and things to see, but please don't occupy the whole sidewalk
Some of us have to get to work and it sucks already that we have narrow sidewalks
Have some self-awareness in cities please
Yes
Thank you, really
So many people dont understand that when visiting Portugal and think they are doing me a favour
They do ofc, but i mean, ive seen people act like they are the saviours of the country
Not against any tourist and we treat them well here, but dont act like your specific presence there is gonna do wonders for my country's economy
We are not that bad
She prefers sweet popcorn
I mean, I'm brazilian and I would definitely go crazy at them if they did it to me
Comi e queria não ter comido
I wouldn't say "hate" per se, but more like how, for a lot of non-Europeans, by "Europe" they only mean England/Germany/France/Italy/Amsterdam and think that what applies in those places applies everywhere else in the Old Continent
What do you mean by "Europeans don't use ice" and "You have to pay to pee all over Europe"?
That we're an homogenous bunch of white snobs
Sometimes you're overlooked even though you're at the very tip of western Europe
Neither do I. By that logic I'd think Americans are huge perverts and degenerates because of their porn industry, shows like Sex in the City and their scantily clothed female pop singers and rappers
I think that stereotype comes from France, i remember watching a documentary on the history Channel (during the morning) a few years ago an saw something about France at one point in history( sec
XIX XX id remember) being the capital of sex (parades, the upper-classes having parter switching has a common practice etc
Has a law student that stereotype annoys me a lot because it false, since a most (if not all) European countries that have a constitucion, have an article giving that right
For some people "European" is exclusively pale white people, apparentely Southern Europe doesn't exist/isn't white
I've only seen like two pay toilets in Portugal
Saw one last year when I went to Madeira which kinda took me aback
I mostly saw pay toilets in Germany, Switzerland and the Benelux countries
To be fair though, China's constitution claims to protect human rights so
I don't understand why American media finds gun violence OK but nudity a no-no
It's like they think that nudity = porn
Or you can just enter a café and ask for a glass of water
At least that's free here in Portugal
In the science of law there's a difference between a mere legality constituion from a State of legality and a true constitucion from a State of rule of law
The constitucion from the state of legality is not a true constitucion, it appears to be a normal constitucion but when you analyse its mechanics you compreende that it doesn't function like a constitucion (this the case with China and North Korea), for example if you read the Portugues constitution from 1933 you will see from a glance that the fundemental rights look almost the same has the current constitucion (1976) however if you look close enough to the 1933 constitucion you understand quickly that something is wrong because the constituion uses ambiguous terms that premite the state to have no limitations to restricte the rights of the citizens
In contrast a true constitucion from a State of rule of law limits the power of action of the state and gives a protection to the citizens that the state cannot break, (example :our current constitucion of 1976, and every other written constitucion of the EU members states and most if not all of the non EU members states that exist in Europe)
Edit i hope this explains, if you have a doubt or questions, i will try to answer it
Edit 2:
TLDR the Chinese constitucion is not a true constitucion because of technical reasons
The European countries constitucions are true constitucions because of technical reasons
But to everyone they're 4 eastern European member states
My cousins live in Sedan, their parents never taught them Portuguese, they pretend to be full blooded French, as if they're ashamed of their origins
When they visited, they never tried to get to know their family, instead they complained about everything, boasted how everything was so much better in France and ran off to the beach
After a while they stopped coming at all
To us, the younger cousins, we didn't care, we thought they were snobs, but it broke my grandmother's heart
Sure but that doesn't matter to how the country has historical and geopolitical baggage with the former USSR than West Germany
I understand that it must have been dificult for them
I heard from my aunt that they were bullied at school and we knew that their parents brought them to Portugal every summer against their will
They didn't feel connected to us or the country
Probably what they were bullied at home played a part in that
In the end, they didn't want to be part of our family and we all went our separate ways
They don't but they heavily matter even today
Why is that
Is it the way we look
How we talk
Do we behave strangely according to the French
I know however the past doesn't stop existing and there's plenty of baggage from the Communist era today
Of course there is
That's why Greece is grouped with Southern Europe (Italy, Spain and Portugal) than with the rest of the Balkans
Even though Portugal is the westermost country in Europe we don't have a complex about being "southern" or not being grouped with wealthy "western Europe".
In Portugal in not so big cities, You could buy a 200m2 house with 4 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms, pool, garden, garage
A really good house for you, sons and maybe grandsons
This is second house, but if you buy the land you probably can have something better, IMO pools are overrated in Portugal where 50% of the country is bathed by sea, which would make you have more space for divisions
You could easily buy a huge farm house with that money here, just a quick search and one of the first I got
86046,94 m2 of field and a house of 203,06 m2 with 3 rooms, but easily you could find better ones and there's loads that aren't even on the internet
In Portugal the tourist trap would be the Algarve
But I'm from the Algarve, so I'm going to tell you what to see there while avoiding the most touristic places
Avoid the main touristic areas
Albufeira, Vilamoura, Monte Gordo, Armação de Pêra and Portimão are cool if you wanna go to crowded beaches, drink booze until you fall over and feel like you are in England but with a hot climate
Any other place would be better to go to the beach
Eat local foods
Why would go to a McDonald's when you are in an entirely different country, with a different culture and food
Visit less known towns
In Silves, for example, the entire town is almost a museum
Castle, cathedral, churches, archeology and history are a must
The area around Sagres and the Vicentina coast are also a must
That area is full of castles and small fortifications to explore and discover, as well as gorgeous nature, small typical villages and the best spot to see the sunset
In Lagos, don't go only to the beach and bars
The city is super historical and there are churches and museums to visit
Same goes to Tavira, Faro and Olhão.
If you like nature or to visit small traditional villages, Monchique, Aljezur, Loulé and inland Tavira are perfect for you
The eastern part of the Algarve is also full of history, specially on the towns on the banks of the Guadiana River
Vila Real de Santo António, Castro Marim and Alcoutim are amazing
Faro also has a fantastic historical center, with the cathedral being the main monument
Scattered throughout the Algarve there are neolithic and classical monuments
In Silves there's the Menhir Route
Near Portimão you have the Necropolis of Alcalar
In Luz (near Lagos) there are Roman Ruins
There's also Roman Ruins in Estói (Estói also has an amazing XIX century palace)
I could keep going with Roman Ruins and neolithic monuments
All in all, the Algarve is an amazing place to discover and explore, with stunning nature, history and local culture
That last one happened to a friend on mine in krakow
He lost more than 1000€ and we were all very concerned because he didn't remember anything and he was alone
Pretty scary in ny opinion and to make things worse we were kn erasmus and didn't speak polish
When I was on Erasmus we had a whole presentation on how to spot an official taxi so we wouldn't be ripped off
Even then, their "night" prices were terrible, and they would still try to rip people off by saying they didn't have change and the money could be a tip
Uber was a godsend
My flatmate was robbed at the strip club exactly the same way you've described
He only remembers being told his payment didn't go through and they had to do it again
The amount of Harry Potter shilling in Edinburgh is insane

Ah yeah, for that steak, "bife da vazia" does literally translate into "steak of the empty one". "Vazia" is just the name of the cut though
As someone who has both lived in Padua and stayed in Lido do Venezia, I'm surprised to see you'd prefer Padua
Ladybug in portuguese is joaninha - little Joan
Tapeworm is "bicha solitária" lit
lonely she-bug
Nah, we are everywhere, we just write in English, unless for maybe subs about our own countries
There is no such thing as an automatic translation
This is the dumbest thing I've seen all year
English
Besides Portuguese subs, I'll write everything in English
And even in portuguese subs like r/portugal sometimes a tourist f.e. posts in english so "the hidden rule" we kinda use is answer in english to help (I mean, it would be rude not to, right
There is an extension of Google Translate to avoid that
Eh, I'd say part of why English is "easy" is because we're heavily exposed to it, learn it from a young age and have closer languages to it
Wouldn't be so easy for, say, a Chinese person to learn it
Yet English phonology is complex considering it's very inconsistent and doesn't have diacritics
Every language has a "hard" part
English is one of the easier languages to learn, but it doesn't come without its hurdles either
Don't forget /r/worldnews , which should be renamed to US foreign affairs news
It's rare to not see a post with Trump in the title there
Same in Portugal
You have "ground floor" (rés-do-chão) and then "first floor" (primeiro andar)
It depends on the noun:
rés-do-chão    --- primeiro **piso** \-- street level
primeiro **andar** \--- segundo **piso** \---
segundo **andar** \--- terceiro **piso** \---
This is the way

Scotland: The television
The history behind the invention of the television is complex, but Alexander Bain introduced the facsimile machine in 1843 to 1846, and in 1926 John Logie Baird was the first person in the world to demonstrate a working television system
The caravel very good ship
There is a village (aldeia) in my region that's literally called village (Aldeia)
No other distinguishing words, just «Aldeia».
Often referred as aldeia Aldeia «the village of Village».
I also believe there's a town on the border that is called border (fronteira)
Portugal has the Madeira island, Madeira means Wood
what do you think it has in abundance
(Clue: it wasn't a bird called Açor, leave that to the Azores )
and the Portuguese name for it is just new land which just as exciting
I wouldn't count that as boring, obvious or bland, though
What's obvious about Amadora being amateur
It's not like it's an amateur city, that's not why it was named Amadora

The European Shitstorm has just begun
Embrace yourselves
Hi pal, I am still proud to be European
This unity made travel around europe a lot less pain in the arse, more freedom in the market, free good exchange
A comon coin in most of the countries
A lot of development pushed forward, talking about my areas: we have EASA, EUROCAE, EUROCONTROL, Airbus itself, (ESA) which pushed europe as a whole to the top of the tops of the aviation industry
For example, people don't have a clue about how cool and advance our air traffic management system is, it can almost automatically coordinate flight departures based on the current weather and forcast, you can get an aircraft to get you of a stand at 11:50 and have on arrive at the same stand at 11:55 without any delay
EUROCONTROL every year sets new goals about hardware and software implementations and those goals are ALWAYS and I say again, always met
EUROCAE gives us the best and most reliable software certifications so passangers can travel safe
EASA push the most strict safety measures and rules of any other country out there
We are great and we work great as an union
You can find it maybe at American Pizzerias like Pizza Hut
But we don't eat pizza that much in Portugal comparing to other european countries so I'm not sure
Not a thing, and have some pity on the italians
Pros: fantastic weather, best food in Europe (you know its true, don't even try
/s), cheap alcohol (be it beer or wine), history, more or less more than stable political discourse in general (especially compared to other European nations)
One of the best roads in Europe
A very active night lifestyle
The view pretty much anywhere, the colours of the city, the way the light shines, the flavour of the coffee is better, a calm and friendly society in general especially to anyone
Pastéis de nata
The legendary portugues (PT, not BR) dragon ball z dub (
Cons: low wages, public transport is expensive especially considering that other countries with much higher cost of living and higher wages have a better service for much less, assholes drivers that think they are on a rally race track and basically are dick heads in general
Housing is impossible thanks to tourists, speaking of tourists because of the influx of people certain things got worse like overcrowding of certain areas and services, scammers in certain parts of the city claiming to "sell drugs" (spices) in a very annoying way
A bit expensive to drive in certain roads do to via verde
It’s basically the same for us
>politics are a joke, racism and blind nationalism
Oh no
Indeed
We have two: “abortadeira” and “desmanchadeira” – this last one comes from “desmancho”, which means to dismantle, undoing or cutting up
Edit: there’s a third and more obscure one, but I cannot remember it
We called it " Parteira" which is the exact same name given to a specialist nurse who does deliveries of babies
In some places they were named "comadres", which is the name given to the relationship between your mother and your partners mother ( co-mother)
Here posh families also used that expression
[Yma O Hyd] is pretty badass
And it's pretty cool how it reached the top of the iTunes chart
The Soviet anthem, is one of the most powerful songs I ever heard
[La Strasbourgeoise] and [Le Chant des Partisans]
I'm might be killed or even worse, prohibited from eating chouriço ever again, but I like the french national anthem
Sorry fellow caralhos
Because you have a lot of cool Marschmusik
That's the reason why the song was originally made, in that exact year,  and one of the reasons that made us eventually turn into a republic, as our king hurt our nacional pride by conceding so easily, making a lot of people resent him for it
1755, All saints day earthquake in Lisbon
Besides the thousands of deaths, either by crushing, fire or drowning due to the tsunami that followed,  this earthquake made quite a hit among the way faith was regarded in Europe, raising questions on how could god punish one of the most Catholic country in Europe on one of Catholicism holiest days
The 1755 Earthquake, occurred on November 1, 1755, resulting in the almost complete destruction of the city of Lisbon and still affecting much of the Algarve coast
and Setúbal
The earthquake was followed by a tidal wave - believed to have reached a height of 20 meters - and multiple fires, certainly causing more than 10,000 deaths (some point to many more)
It was one of the deadliest earthquakes in history, marking what some historians call the prehistory of Modern Europe
Seismologists estimate that the 1755 earthquake reached magnitudes between 8
7 to 9 on the Richter scale
The Lisbon earthquake had a huge political and socioeconomic impact on Portuguese society in the 18th century, giving rise to the first scientific studies of the effect of an earthquake in a wide area, thus marking the birth of modern seismology
The event was widely discussed by Enlightenment philosophers, such as Voltaire, inspiring significant developments in the field of theodicy and the philosophy of the sublime
[sauce]
85% of the buildings of one of the richest cities in the world were destroyed
I can't even imagine how much was lost, from libraries to museums
At least 46 palaces were pulverized
Do not forget about the massive fire afterwards that fully destroyed downtown capital
And the hundreds that died in the pillaging that followed
It was a disaster as we cannot even imagine
The azores are right in a three tectonic plate intersection, the American, Eurasian and African plates, so yeah, it can be unstable
There's basically several small earthquakes each year near the coast in Algarve and Lisbon
I'd say bacalhau
I mean we definitely eat it, but mostly on special occasions or when at a restaurant
It's not the type of thing I'd cook on any old day of the week
Spanish people order a lot of bacallao dorado, golden cod, which I did not know what it is, but from the other thread apparently is Bacalhau à brás. We eat it but do not call it that
I hear brazillians talk of something called Bacalhoada as a codfish dish, I do not know what it is either
We got a lot of cod recipes though
Nando's and periperi sauce - we eat a lot of frango de churrasco with piripiri (different spelling and also different sauce as far as I can tell) but nando's food is just different as far as I can tell
Maybe because souflés are always a bitch
Yeah definitely a dish for when you've got time to spend cooking
I usually only eat it at family meals or when having dinner with friends
That is kind of funny
I mean it is a bit of stereotype, which is why they most likely chose the name, but it's as random as calling it "Codfish" in English

Sorry, my brain wasn't getting there
we use notebooks but:
math-green
science-blue
portuguese-red
french-blue
physics-green
I feel you, I'm so confused by all this
My textbooks, all had a plain black or blue cover
I never had a folder with any colors as well
Just plain black notebooks
One for each course
I'm not sure if this is what the thread is about, but the only "customizable" thing we had were the notebooks, in which we took notes in class
Maybe that's what the OP means
Still, if it's that, I'm not sure we had the colors thing
At most, the notebooks had a strip of color at the end of each page and each notebook had like 4 of 5 different colors, you could assign to each subject
But I - and I think most people - did it randomly each year or every time they started a notebook
Otherwise, people just bought the notebooks they liked the best
In my later school years, the most common type of notebooks were [the small, cheap black ones] usually one of per subject
I think he might be talking about either that you were saying or those dossier separators, you know
Those were differently coloured (bad word) to each class
Oh, right, of course
Not many people used those, in my experience, as they're just not very practical
They're quite bulky to carry around and usually didn't last long, with the pages easily torning from revolving them too much
I think kids in early school years, with less subjects and less stuff to write down used them more
Still, is there a specific color coding for those, though
I think people just used to assign them randomly or at most, put the most common subjects like Portuguese or Math right at the beginning, regardless of the color, just because it's more practical to open the dossier and find those right away

Our winters, you are really really going to feel the cold
OTOH sun in December, it is awesome
Well, after reading your comment, I am not sure what I am supposed to say or even doing here
Yes, and things in Switzerland are twice as expensive
German wages comparing to expenses continue to be one of the best in Europe
In Portugal we get half of german wages and things are the same or more expensive
This show no understanding in the reality in the rest of Europe and the World
Pretty sure we're not much better either
Probably the Azores, the smaller islands
My bet would be on Algarve, everyone goes there on vacation and I never heard somebody say they hated Algarve
I would say either Lisbon or Coimbra and Porto they are generally regarded has the most popular
Porto and Lisbon are kinda rivals, they both have a great number of the population, although living in the actual city's are becoming increasingly impossible do to tourism ruining the housing market and increasing sound pollution, both this cities are beautiful, Lisbon is an ancient city with wonders everywhere too many to list, and Porto has a bit of 18/19 century charm with their bridge made by eiffel
Coimbra is the city of the higher education, its not has popular has the previous 2 but its generally liked by everyone
For cities I was thinking Coimbra or Leiria
I feel like no one dislikes either of those
I was thinking about it, and for living I would say Aveiro
I never met anyone who lived there and didn't like it
Cacia smell
Where you detect it depends from wind direction - and if the mill is running
It can be a bit sickening
Until some years ago, Lidl was cheap and low-quality products, and their stores didn't looked good, but then they improved a lot, although they're not considered the best or premium, their products are good or very good, their stores have a much better and more modern decoration and they sell good bread, which can be seen as a sign of not being a cheap supermarket
Lidl is still seen as a low price supermarket, but not so extreme as some years ago
Its good
It has those 1 or 2 things no other supermarket has
A few years ago it was the only one that had stuff like fresh bread every day, croissants, donuts, and some things that were like croissant dough and inside it could have like meat, chesse and ham, sausage ( here its called "folhado", dont know the english name)
Overall i dont have any specific complains and the quality is good
in Portugal there is Lidls but most people don't go them and its not too much popular
Lidl is seen as a kind of "limited" supermarket, they do not have a big selection and the stores look a bit basic, though they are attacking the portuguese market with more high end looking stores, and bakeries and in a few cases in store fresh fish shops
They often just carry their own brand of some items, which can seem a bit limiting
But I think particularly in Portugal, everybody cross shops, the poorer people often use more the supermarkets close to them but everybody might use whichever supermarket is closest
Lidl puts out this weekly newspaper which reaches lots of people
Aldi is also expanding in Portugal but keeping many very german things, and it has this very unexpected niche - the aisle of special things, some of which have a reputation for being very good (electronics, cookware, tools, cosmetics) and they have this big range of food for people with alternate dietary requirements (vegans, people on high protein diets, gluten free, lactose free and so on) which means they can catch a lot of very different people
Lupin vegan icecream, protein bars, lactose free cheese, stuff like that
It's great for those ridiculous promotions when it comes to appliances
My aunt, for instance, bought a super cheap sewing machine there during a promotion, and my mom has bought a toastie iron and other at much lower prices
For regular stuff, you go there for the convenience because it's close and small, but the quality isn't great and it's not that cheap compared to other places
It's considered a good supermarket, with the best bread you can find
Yeah
I'd say they've gone up in reputation, really: they're now kind of middle-grade, certainly over Minipreço and the like
I think you'd be surprised
I've been in a lot of Lidls (in fact, I go to one semi-regularly) and it certainly isn't deserted
Yea, my hometown lidl was also bulldozed and rebuild to a newer one
I'm surprised that they invest a lot on their appeal
That depends on the person
I don't have any real life friends, but I have some online ones and none of them are female
I just find it harder to relate to women, I guess
When I was a kid in the '90s, most little kids usually preferred to hang out with kids of the same age and gender when they're playing, since they had similar interests
Many adults and other kids do that teasing thing when they see a boy and a girl together: "Hey, is that your girlfriend/boyfriend
" which makes a kid terribly uncomfortable
With games like hide-and-seek or catch, you would see a mixed group of boys and girls, not so much when they were playing soccer, usually, only the girls who were talented at sports wanted to play
As teenagers and adults, that usually stops and you usually see a much of boys and girls hanging out together as a group of friends
When I was in college my class consisted of 110 female students and 20 male (medical school), there were a lot of female-only groups, but you usually had 1 or 2 boys in the group
My group of friends was 6 girls and one guy, who already had a girlfriend back home, and we hung out as friends
No one ever teased him of having a harem
Usually we say "Estou
" (or 'tou if you want to abbreviate) for some reason
I never really understood why, because it literally means "I am"
Informal calls are started normally by “‘Tou
”, but formal calls are started by “Estou sim
Daqui fala [name]”
We say "Estou" or "Tou", estou comes from the verb estar, which is basically the verb to be
(note: the verb to be has 2 variants in portuguese, the verb "estar" and the verb "ser")
Yeah it's a bit weird, because it is not an affirmation, it's a question
We actually ask "Am I?". It's very philosophical if you think about it
For the furniture and bulky, large appliances, the most usual method is to include delivery
Less common, but unheard of, is renting a Van
For drywall, I had to find a translation
Preplastered wall boards, usually gypsum plaster on wooden/cardboard support
I would think the same thing, although I have yet to see those systems in use on private homes, TBH
We usually plaster/render the bricks/blocks that are in the interior wall, and then paint them
Usually the place you buy the items from has a delivery service (sometimes free)
If that's not the case, you can always rent transport services or ask your friend or family member that has a van
I believe it goes both ways, quebecois also use english loanwords that french people, in turn, usually don't use, like «chum»
Not USA by the beach
I’ll grab the tremoços
Ditto with you and Swiss Germans/Austrians
You’re probably more likely to try to speak German if not speaking to a German
The only other term I know, besides babysitter, is "ama-seca" which is kind of old-timey and it means "dry nurse" as opposed to a "ama-de-leite" (wet nurse)
I think the most colloquial terms I've ever seen to refer to babysitting jobs have always used roundabout wording like "toma-se conta de crianças" = we watch over/take care of children
And they weren't exactly very common ads, as it were
I think people either use daycares or ask the grandparents for help, more often than not
To be fair here having someone not from the family or friends babysitting is very rare
From my experience (upper-middle class from Porto) it just isn't a paid job
Frequently my grandparents, aunts or family friends watched me over when needed
It's a very foreign concept here, I think it has to do with income inequality and how class functions in Brazil
I'm going to have to side with your portuguese friends, here, because I've also never heard that word before
Wait, schools taught you how to do stuff at home
I did not
Sometimes we didn't even have running water
Same thing here
> Each year parents have to sign you up for them, so you don't have to attend them if your parents don't want you to
So not mandatory ...
Personally I don’t like it, if people want citizenship the least they could do is learn the language
I was in Poland for just 6 months and I felt the need to at least know the basics of the language to help get around, I can’t comprehend that somebody asking for citizenship wouldn’t do the same
I mean learning Portuguese is extremely hard, even harder is the European version of portugueses do to the complex sounds variation etc
From my knowledge has law student, and i admit ignorance at this subject (if i make a mistake pls correct me in the comments i appreciate learning), there's 3 way of gaining citizenship:
* 1 either being born in Portuguese territory or in a Portuguese vessel like a plane or boat, or claiming citizenship from a being descendant of a Portuguese citizen
Exp you are in vacation and you came to Portugal and wife has kid in Portugal, he's a Portuguese, let's say that kid grows up in your original country of his parents, and his kid's that were born there can claim Portuguese citizenship from being descendant, although this goes until the 5 generation past that is no
* 2 is normal application for citizenship when the previous doesn't apply, that from what i understand is hard to get do to some Inefficiency and hard criterias
* 3 is buy investing in the country a certain amount of money, this is called vistos gold, i understand and compreende why they exist but at a fundamental level i cannot agree with their existence because its goes against any moral values because it discriminates base on income access to a right
What if everyone speaks English
I don’t think not speaking the local language means you can’t interact with locals
Well
have you actually tried it
Not being 100% comfortable with a language doesn’t mean that they don’t want to connect and make friendships
And that’s very good, learning languages is great
I just don’t think everyone needs to do that, that’s all
I'd argue accents are fine, as long as you're understood
Everyone has one
Agreed
I studied Communication Design in Portugal, and before that Architecture (until I decided it wasn't for me)
We pretty much had to pay for our own stuff
In Architecture you could make use of spare materials lying around, like card and k-line, but there was hardly any so we had to buy our own
There was a laser cutter, wood cutter, and 3D printer, but iirc it was hard to get permission to use them, so most people used services outside the university
In Communication Design we also had to buy our own materials outside of the campus, and although we had to pay the printers, we had a discount at least
In Architecture we had a free student license for Autodesk software, but in Communication Design not once did the lecturers talked about how to access Adobe software
I think the idea was that we'd ask for permission to access the school's iMac room, but everyone just illegally downloaded the software
I then did a master's in Scotland and it was more or less the same as in Portugal, except we could use laser cutters and 3D printers free of charge (among other things) so long as we signed our names beforehand and waited for our turn
We were also given very little direction on how to set up our exhibitions for the degree show, which was very stressful
As for projects done whilst studying at university, I don't believe they ever stated that said work belongs to them
As far as I know we could do freelance projects and not owe the university anything
And I don't think any projects done for university belonged to them either
Wait, but she gave you all of the money or a cut
If it is March 21st ( first day of spring varies and it was later before 2000 because February 29th 2000 was a reset which happens every 400 years in Gregorian calendars) no
In fact it is tree day here, for primary school and kindergarten students often activities are about trees and sometimes really nice
The last day of second period ( we have 3 school periods) the last day right before Easter holiday can be really quite crazy, and yeah skipping school or being very lazy day
Nah
Seems like a really random day for students to decide skipping school on

Portugal had a dead queen on the throne
Prince Pedro fell in love with his wife's handmaiden and had an affair with her, eventually marrying her in secret after his wife's death, but his father opposed and ordered her death
After Pedro became King, he exhumed her corpse, named her Queen and forced her killers to kiss her decomposing hand before ordering their deaths in front of him by ripping out their hearts, all the while he ate his lunch
William Shakespeare, eat your heart out
It's a shame the story of Pedro and Inês isn't more well known abroad, it's like a real life Romeo and Juliet but better
Don't mind me, I'm just here to take the Portugal Train
Game Of Thrones level of death
Thats why I have Slovenian decendents that emigrated to germany in the early 20th century
Crazy
You Poles sure are a contentious people
Well, you have to balance the Swede's right to life with the right to feel safe, not to mention national security concerns
Come on board
Thanks
Did you hear about it here on Reddit
I think that's just America
I doubt Portugal has a plan to invade Mongolia
If anything portugal has a plan to NOT invade anyone
No, I was talking about the Swede walking on ice water, that's very dangerous for Denmark
Our plan is to do whatever the British tell us to do, which is problematic, because the British plan is to do whatever the Americans tell them to do
That's why we got involved in Iraq
T. Alberto Barbosa
Men and women with moustache
Fado music is mostly a Lisbon and Coimbra thing
Bullfighting also isn't overwhelmingly popular
A lot of people dislike it or don't care about it at all
Plus, it's more popular in the Center/South and South parts of the country than in the North
In Portugal, bullfighting is actually seeing a rise
The last televised fight was seen by more than 15% of the population and the arenas are almost always full
I refuse to believe Russians don't ride bears to work
We have those in Portugal too
It isn't overwhelmingly popular but has seen a rise in recent times and a 25% increase in arena attendance
Isn't that a romance countries thing
Like in Portugal we also eat some dishes made with snails, and i think that also applies to Spain and other romance countries
But it exists here and a lot of people know it does and aren't aware that it's more of a regional thing and can be a controversial thing to talk about
Also, Catholicism
We're not a super religious nation like some foreigners assume we are
Our traditional bullfighting is with the horse, like the rejoneo, with spikes and blood and all of that
But we also have the forcados, like you showed that come after the horse
They are suposed to catch the bull
The biggest difference is that we dont kill the bull in the arena
If the bull is brave he goes to reproduction and if dont he is killed and eaten
British probably wouldn't drink tea if it weren't for the portuguese
When sailors were bored during the long voyages  during the Ages of Discoveries, some would catch a shark, place it in the ship and play touradas (bullfighting) with it
Portugal has basically a world wide monopoly on Cork wood applications, because the rest of the world only uses it has Cork for the wine bottles, we use to make wallets shoes helmet interiors instead of foam etc
Also we are the biggest producer of Cork wood so chances are that your bottle Cork wood is Portuguese
We're first (if u don't count the Viking) but Spain gets all the credit
Hey, we too
The expression "girls are made of spice and everything nice" came from the Portuguese Queen Catherine of Braganza who married the English King and brought both the habit of the 5 o'clock tea and spices with her dowry
Portugal also handed Bombay to Britain as a gift, it was called Boa Baía, which means "Good Harbour".
The British treated her like garbage because she was Catholic, tried to kill her for "treason" and her husband cheated on her repeatedly and even placed his mistress as her hand-maiden
When he died, Catherine finally came home to Portugal where she eventually died after serving as counselor to her nephew, the King

>modern Turkey has more skyscrapers than all Europe combined except Russia
Not surprising, most europeans think of skyscrapers as an eyesore
In almost every city the highest building is a church tower and people actively oppose building anything higher than what was already built
11:32 minutes
that didnt end in the [Treaty of Edinburgh] in 1560
They were bored, had scurvy and going insane with cabin fever, playing with sharks instead of killing each other was the better solution for the crew
Well, tbf, in most places of the world they are seen as a sign of progress, just not in Europe
For most of my life I thought every house/apartment had estores/persianas
Now I can't imagine moving anywhere but Spain because I literally couldn't live without them
Thing is, there's stuff with similar names in other countries but they're not the same thing, though they typically have a similar shape
Here in Portugal we have croquetes but they're made of mince meat
And I think in France a croquette is made of potatoes
The Netherlands is simply a depressing place gastronomically
No I don't think so although I did try a lot of the Dutch fried snacks
Pastel de nata
It's popularity overseas has been rising thru the roof and it's well worth it
[pastel de nata]
Thera are a lot of dessert, but my favorite is "Serradura"
I am not sure and definitely not a favorite of mine, but I would like to hear from other European countries if they have it or not: bread with marmalade and cheese
When I say bread, I mean regular bread, cut like a sandwich
not a cake
Edit: the most popular, because its cheap, its only with marmalade
Oh look, a mil-folhas
(thousand-sheets)
Funny, we have many of those, but slightly different and not as popular as they are there
Do you have the [churros with filling] Those with chocolate like Nutella
oh, boy
We also make this version called [fartura] It's hot and crunchy on the outside, and very soft (almost melts in your mouth when it's fresh) on the inside
Now I'm hungry
Pastéis de nata aren't dessert, they're more afternoon pastries than something in a real meal
pastéis de nata are not desserts
Best dessert ever
Love it
Bolo de bolacha, suponho
Bah, amateur
Ehehehe
You just can't stop, can you
The crispy crust, the sweet filling and that lovely powdered sugar and cinnamon just make it perfect
See what you did
Now I gotta get out to buy some
Very nice also and really easy to make at home
No one to try and step on the back of a Portuguese,  as another Portuguese
Here we see our lovely " crabs in a bucket" attitude
Well, I love to have an expresso and a pastel de nata at the end of my meals
Can I keep on doing it
Or can I commit the heresy of having a nata as breakfast
Regular bread, French type, not toasted
Not the best example, but like this [one]
Not a fan, as I said, an improbably combination, but it doesn’t taste that bad
Give it a try and let me know
Not a fan, also found it weird
We call those "russos" (it means russians, but that's a name we give things that are white washed-off, like old clothes or gray hair), mostly because we cover them with powdered sugar
I will because no one in this coutry does look at them as dessert
It's like saying you eat a croissant or a pain au chocolat in a big meal
you can also eat pizza for dessert, no one is stopping you
does that also make pizza a dessert
You are free to do it only societally it's not a thing in Portugal
Same as having antipasti or usually having a sandwich for lunch
That we got our independence from Spain, which we did not, since there was no Spain then
We became independent from the Kingdom of Léon around 1143 (definitions vary depending which treaty or papal bull you consider the official instrument of independence)
Actually, I think a bigger misconception about Portugal would be that it's a province of Spain or a former Brazillian colony
You has well ? :)
No, because that was not a political union, and it was not our independence
It was a personal union, not a political union, in that the same person was separetely king of both parts
But the army, courts, laws, the empire, was independent
>Portus Cale (the Duchy of Porto
You got a bunch of concepts confused up
Porto, Portus just means harbour, and the Cale part (Gaia now) would be even more the name
Nobody knows what that root means, but it is probably related to the Gal- in Galicia or Gaul
The condado portucalense, the portuguese county got its independence from the kingdom of Leon, but it was never a duchy (there were no dukes in Portugal till a royal bastard in the late 15th century), and its capital was not Porto, but Braga, with Guimarães being very important on its history also
There are two cities right accross each other, on the mouth of the river there
Porto is one, the other is Gaia, Vila Nova de Gaia
The name of Portugal probably comes from both of them, and the Gaia part is more important, unique, since Porto/Portus just means harbour
Harbour of Gaia, maybe
When the county existed the name applied to the whole region, and its capital was actually Braga
We don't have anything of the sort here in Portugal as far as my knowledge goes
Yeah
At least here, it is
We learn everything about it, the good and the bad, but somehow we always end up romanticising it all
Talking about how great we were at the sea and how much we conquered through it, that’s means of course that although we learn about the bad we tend to “forget” about it when speaking about how great our empire was
With this I don’t mean to say that everything about it was bad (especially) because I don’t believe it was but it does put my mind at ease when we talk about how we learn from our mistakes and that in time we ended up “correcting” them the best that we could
I can't talk for every Portuguese, obviously
But, before I started using Reddit and other forms of social media in English, I used to be rather critical and cynical about the romanticizing of the Portuguese empire, though it was over the top
However, after seeing the indifference and lack of knowledge that a lot of people seem to have about the Portuguese empire, I started to become more defensive about the subject lol
I agree though I might be a bit biased
Tokyo, nagoia, hiroshima and Nagasaki (because
You know), Osaka and that's about it

Tokyo, Osaka, Hiroshima, Nagazaki and i can't think of anything else, sorry
Definitely [José Hermano Saraiva] which over the years presented multiple shows about Portuguese history
I remember that show, it was great
And we surely miss him dearly
when I was a teenager I used to watch his shows over any cartoons or movies
I would say André Ventura
He Is the leader of CHEGA
(ENOUGH
) a new far right wing party
You know, that kinda of ultra nationalist party that the left loves to call fascists
He as been envolved in a lot of controversies since he was elected to parliament (and before that), especially for speaking against the gypsy community
Recently he propesed a "specific confinement for the gypsy community" and got a lot of hate for it
He was heavilly criticized by Ricardo Quaresma (a gyspsy football player) and is considered a racist by many people
André Ventura, he is the portuguese far-right party leader
This guy was a football commentator that supported Benfica, so he got a lot of traction because more than half of Portugal's population are also Benfica supporters
We have a rich left-wing history, so, so far he's not getting huge results, but the trend is changing, and I foresee him getting good results in a near future
I love you for that
But he should be in jail nonetheless
I would argue José Sócrates, for obvious reasons
Good question
USA is still world's biggest agent in geopolitical matters, and so far has been Europe's closest ally, as Huntington wrote we share the same ideologies and culture creating, therefore, the Western Civilization
So considering that Trump is making USA isolate from the long lasting ties with Europe, somehow it affects directly the influence of Europe's sphere
And this can be interpreted by Europeans in two ways
Either is time for Europe to create stronger bonds and give more power to the EU so we remain a key player in worlds geo politics, and I vibe with this since we've been the bastion of rich democracies
Or we go down in history and will be pushed around by authoritarian regimes like China, India and Russia
So back to your question
For now, europeans don't like Trump's ideals but not hate the person itself since it doesn't affect us yet
But only time and the New World Order will tell
He said right now, so I think André Ventura is a better answer (even though Sócrates is still hated by a lot of people)
It's a first name in Portugal too
I still hate Jose Sócrates and will be an hater forever
His actions were far more damaging to Portugal than anything that Ventura can do
I am no fortune teller
But Biden seems to have no chance
Sure, but he isn't really a thing anymore
I agree with you
It's just that Ventura is under the spot light right now and I think it is a better answer because of that
Usually no, our toasts are on a grill, except one famous notorious exception which is called the francesinha
Not sure I would call it fried, but it certainly goes into a frying pan
Yes we do
You can find it in every corner, they are called "Tosta mista" which include cheese+ham
Another thing i usually add is a mix of ketchup+mayo and those mini "fried stick chips" that i have no idea how to translate
Yeah i too use a toaster
Let's just say it's our little secret ok
Its not like the usual fried chips like mc donalds, they are like really thin and little
Search for batata palha (in portuguese)
Oh right, you guys use it a lot in street hot dogs right
We are a warm, cheap and safe country for the people from important european countries to spend their hollidays in
We also export our brightest minds to said important countries bc the smart people dont want to stay in this shithole country
They know they can make a lot more elsewhere in the EU
So there it is
Natural beauty and bright minds
Let British people retire in Algarve and mainly cooking cod in a thousand different ways

It has one of the lowest immigration rates in westerm Eu
So not really
Since after the roman empire you're full of excuses, stop it Italy
I cant remember anyone in Modern history
I would say the three mans that betrayed Viriato
Viriato was a lusitanian leader that fought very successfully against the Roman but was killed by three soldiers that were paid by the Romans
Cant remember his exact name (D.Pedro i think) but he basicaly escaped to Brasil and gave then the independence and alot of technological progress and almost didnt care about Portugal itself
>D.Pedro
I think you're skipping a big part of history there, man
D. Pedro IV of Portugal (and D. Pedro I of Brazil) did escape Portugal
as a child, with the rest of the royal family, during the French Invasions (also known as the Peninsular Wars)
He also did declare the independence of Brazil from Portugal, and it was exactly that that made him abdicate the Portuguese throne in benefit of his daughter, D. Maria II
His brother, D. Miguel, then tried to seize power and reestablish absolutism (which had just ended) , which made Pedro abdicate from his throne as Emperor of Brazil (in benefit of his son, also named Pedro) and return to Portugal to fight his brother to reestablish the short-lived constitutional monarchy (in the Liberal Wars), in which he was sucessful, and return Maria II to power
He was no traitor
Yeah those are the boring bits of history i forget
My bad and thanks
A homeless woman gave birth and immediately after put her, alive and breathing, baby in recycling bin, the baby was then found barely hanging to life by a couple of homeless people that were walking by that heard the baby barely crying
There's plenty of outrage, the defence of this women is or is going to claim insanity and metal health problems so that she's not punish with jail with attempted infanticide and abandoned of family, and instead be treated by a mental health facility
There's a few problems with that because there's some doubts about her mental health
The population hates this incident because of obvious reasons
A Homeless woman left a newborn baby in a trash bin in Lisbon
She Copulated for drug money, and the baby was an "woops".
Last week a homeless woman, 20 years old, left her newborn to die on a recycling bin, still with the umbilical cord attached to the baby
The baby was then found 15 hours later by a homeless man, the area around the bin is occupied by groups of homeless people, and sent to the hospital, where he is stable and healthy
This event created a big discussion on the news and social media about homelessness and the moral aspect of the crime
As for now the girl that threw the newborn away is on prison awaiting trial and has been reported that she refused help from the state before and during her pregnancy
Also, our public health system is "collapsing" and it seems that every other day there is some new hospital closing, during certain hours, due to the lack of specialized staff
Sometime after I moved to Lisbon I got sick
Went to a restaurant and ordered some chicken soup
It was made with rice
Why would someone do that
After that I asked around and learnt that in South Portugal they cook it like that
There are all sorts of difference between North/South Portugal because even though we're a small country until maybe the 80s people were born, lived and died in the same village
Chicken soup with rice is the original
It is calle canja from the chinese congee, which is made with rice
Pasta is not a crime, if you must, but it is people who make it with pasta which are deviating from tradition
People in the 16th or 17th century certainly were not buying small shape pasta to make canja
I'm from southern Portugal and we do chicken soup sometimes with rice and othertimes with pasta
I used to have with rice when I was sick
Chicken soup with rice is an outright culinary abomination
puta que pariu oh mano, sopa com arroz devia ser crime
If I showed my German father a Bayern-München jersey I would probably be kicked from house

I don't really like bacalhau
For some reason, people don't believe me or even take offence when I say I don't like codfish
Corruption
Not being able/willing to save money or manage money both private and public funds
I suck at football and I don't really like watching the games either
Codfish is not my favorite fish
I don't know what the bigger shame for a Fin is, you not liking Saunas or you actually being social
Next thing you're going to say you don't drink either
So you like to hang with dudes wirhout clothes
I don't like wine and love beer
Wanna switch places
You'd fit right in here
I was going to say the same xD
- For Englishman to see: refers to a half-assed gig that only looks good in the surface
"De Espanha nem bom vento nem bom casamento" (From Spain no good wind nor a good marriage, meaning nothing good comes from Spain )
"Deves ser espanhol tu a ver as coisas" (you must be Spanish for seeing stuff) it refers to someone that's seeing something while touching it a lot when they shouldn't or its not really appropriate
"ver-se Grego" or "isto para mim é Grego" (seeing ourselves Greek; this for me is Greek
the first means having a difficult time with something, the second means something too difficult for me to understand
In Portugal to kids, when they keep touching things at the store or smth we say "stop touching things you're not Spanish"
"À grande e à Francesa"- Big and french-like, roughly, meaning, doing something outlandish and expensive
Not really a saying, but we have ["Francesinha"] meaning little french girl which is quite possibly one of the best things in portuguese cuisine
It is basically a sandwich with tons of different meats, served with a somewhat spicy sauce and french fries (ironically, french fires in portuguese does not refer the french in any way)
"Isso é chinês para mim" or "Estás a falar em chinês", meaning That is chinese to me, or You're speaking in chinese, when someone says something you don't understand
And then "De Espanha nem bons ventos nem bons casamentos"- From Spain, no good winds nor good weedings
If we need to vomit we say "I will call the Greek" and the act of vomiting is: gregar (kind of "making the Greek") no idea why
"Devo estar a falar [Insert Foreign Language Here]" (I must be speaking [Insert Foreign Language Here]) It's used in Portugal when in an argument and someone doesn't understand or continuously ignores what you're saying
We use this especially with languages such as Chinese, Japanese, Russian, German, Mandarin, etc
you forgot "From Spain don't come good winds nor good marriages"
So the answer to my chronic underachieving is that I'm just Russian
Tenho a impressão que veio do Brasil até em relação com a não abolição da escravatura
That is not a nationality
It says that people from Spain aren't good partners what isn't a nationality
being spanish

> I was an exchange student in the UK I remember being shocked to find out we couldn't ask questions during a lecture
That's strange
Thought you could ask questions during a lecture everywhere
I think we need one of these for /r/Portuguese
English natives learning the language are constantly wondering there how this works and it doesn't help it's vastly different between Brazilian and European Portuguese
where are you from
grew up
you got no flair
Because if something looks racist or not, to a society, depends on its mores
Americans have a specific code for racism, they had minstrel shows, and they have this huge load of associations with minstrel shows, which were used to mock and put down african americans for centuries
But I have seen americans be completely full of shit seeing racism in things which are not (asking an african american if they want chicken, in Portugal, or some hype about colonel Sanders in a japanese summer promotion being tanned and eating watermelon)
I agree
It's so good for the mind too
Having a longer lunch hour, with good food and good company helps us keep our minds free from the stress of work, so when we get back in the afternoon, it feels like we're starting a fresh day
Not to mention when it turn them into full events, like those big lunches with family or friends that literally last the whole day
They're great
Well sounds like the UK is a good place for teachers with a huge ego who just want to hear themselves talk
You are american
You are offended by different things than others are
americans think it terribly racist if somebody is wearing facial paint for the epiphany cortege to play Balthazar
You are living in a foreign country, maybe it is time to think that different cultures got different contraints and cultural associations
Hard to do if you have a fixed schedule to keep to (like open hours to the public, for instance)
> The Conguitos mascot is a cartoon that intentionally parodies the physical appearance of black people
If you parody the physical appearance of people of other races, say dutch kids, or chinese kids, or dunno viking kids, or mayan kids, is it all racist
What do black spanish people think, compared to black foreigners
Is it parodying white people racist
I know
But let us get back to if parodying white people (say dutch kids, or viking kids or italian kids) is racist as well
clogs, snub noses, round faces, butter yellow hair
French guys with stripe shirts and a beret and a baguette
The french are certainly mocked a lot
And my point is, what is mocked, what is a sore point, it varies from culture to culture and it is a bit overwhelming of americans to assume all the rest of the world has the same history of minstrel shows and Jim Crow, and watermelon and chicken and whatever that I do not even understand
( it took me a long time to learn about the watermelon and the chicken I am not sure I even understand)
Bullfights
Just, WHY
Well in some areas up north have a celebration like carnival, people dress up with multiple colours suits with a paper like texture, and if my memory doesn't fail me, only the boys dress like that and they try to kiss the girls or at least be playful with them
Even higher north in trás dos montes there's a marcial art fighting style that involves only a stick, at least according to stories from my ancestors from there
They are unique and fun to watch
Yeah, probably what I hate the most about this country, fuck anyone who supports it
The forcados are the only good thing to ever come out of it
Except the Forcados
Catching a bull with your bare hands
Now that is awesome
It's a thing in Portugal, Spain, south of France and latin america (only in some ex spanish colonies, in Brazil it's unheard)
Its a very split thing and he also did alot of good things, some people say it was good he existed other people dissagre
But its Salazar, a dictactor but not as fascist as german and italy dictatorships
Where do I start
We once lost our country to Spanish rule
When D. Sebastião marched much of our country's nobility into Morroco in an attempt to lead a great crusade against the Moors
The dumbfuck decides to march into the middle of the desert and lead the army personally
That's alright
He died
That's alright, we get his son on the throne
He doesn't have a son, he's almost a child
Ok, get his brother on the throne
His dad died even before he was born, he didn't have a chance to make another kid
Alright, alright, think
Does he have any other relatives
Yes
Who
A 90 year old cardinal
For fuck's sake Sebastião!
And the French failed their invasion so hard they tried three times
And we did kind of play a huge role in the Atlantic slave trade
And the Methuen treaty
And the mess after the monarchy was abolished
More like, we were doing fine with no nobles and no church and then D. Manuel decided to give them back the power
*Then* we lost the country to Spain
We were basically asking for it by then
The irish font is beautiful
Aren't the conditions too harsh for major human settlements
I've thought that if Russia developed its easternmost coast there could be many major trade routes there and the world would change a bit, with the US on the other side and China, Japan and SK close
The okhotsk region seems to be a litlle forgotten by everyone (at least non Russians) but with its geography it could be a very interesting hub
Cheap but cool thrift shops
Cheerfulness and openness
Hmmm
for some reason I can relate to that
I'm with you
Then there are some cool thrift shops on Instagram but the prices are high you're better off buying something new
That is so true
If I didn’t have money with me a couple of times, I would be in troubles, because they didn’t accept card payment
Also I couldn’t redraw in a lot of ATMs
Somebody explained that Germany, or at least some areas, don’t adopt the most common payment system used in the rest of Europe
But I am not sure about that, but there must be a technical and bureaucratic explanation for it
I'll swap you that for central heating in the Winter (jk I can't afford air conditioning)
I agree
Visited your country many times, love it, but always ended up at Migros buying bread, cheese and cold cuts
You are not alone
Dresden was a miserable experience when comes to that
Tip: go to Santander and redraw cash in their ATM
Since I travel a lot and visit thrift shops everywhere, I agree with my Portuguese fellow redditors
The point is that in here a thrift shop with cool stuff would probably charge you 15 or 20, instead of 4
The problem is that we mostly have extremes: either they are super cheap, but lacking cool or neat stuff; or they have neat stuff, but are kind of expensive (at least considering what they are selling)
In other words, thrift shops in here take themselves too seriously, like they are selling antiques or vintage or whatever
For example, you want to buy a new jacket but the one you like costs 60€ so you decide to look for a similar one on an Instagram "cool" thrift shop
They, in fact have a jacket similar to the one you like
Cool, it must be really cheap compared to the brand new one since it's used and has probably 5 to 10 years
You check the price and it's 50€ plus shipping
I just draw a perfect recreation of the Z in the DBZ logo
In all seriousness I draw it sometimes with a middle stroke, sometimes without
Middle stroke when I want to reinforce the fact that it's a capital letter
Same here but that "3" z is common if you write in cursive
Yes, most people have them
Since there are so many people named Ana, Maria or José, they are usually called by their second name
50/50, and when it's used its barely used, if that makes sense
Yes they are extremely common but rarely used with a few exceptions, we also have 2 last name but those are always used
For example some girls are named Ana Rita some just perfer being called Ana other girls only perfer being called Rita other perfer the 2 when referring to them
yes, very
Yes I even got a da or (of) in my name make its full length 5  words
Like this: 1st name- second name- family name
Yeah they are very common but never spoken
And for those three names plus João as a first name, people often go by the combination of both names too
Pretty common for someone to be known as, say, Ana Filipa or João Paulo
>5-7 names
Bit of an exaggeration, I'd say 3-6 is the expected amount
And some people do use two surnames as the standard form of their name, somewhat common in politics and the media for instance
Wait you officially changed your name to have your boyfriend's?
Okay but you use your boyfriend's name
Why
Most of them do
That has warrent some situations such as once where my mother was stopped at the reception of a place because they couldn't understand she was my father plus one even if she didn't have any of his surnames
The gun/military fetish
Saying they're Irish, German or something else when they're actually American
Ok, I get it, you're referring to your ancestry
But if you just say "I'm Irish" I'm gonna assume you mean, you know, your nationality
So don't tell a European you're Irish or a Chinese that you're Korean because people are gonna assume you mean the nationality
Also, referring to speakers of languages as if they're some sort of ethnic group
French-Canadians, for example
Or calling Mexicans and Puerto Ricans Spanish
Or referring to Brazilian singers as Portuguese singers
I'm not sure if this is an American thing or an English-language thing
No one in Portugal would refer to a Mexican as Spanish or an American comedian as an "English comedian".
I've actually noticed that sometimes Americans here on Reddit give out people's names for no reason when telling anecdotes from their lives
It's exactly the same in Europe
Warmer/southern countries will usually wear shoes inside, while colder/northern countries will not
You still need to get it back

Some people like Nova business school as well but I find it pretty meh
On the whole Lisbon isn’t great for modern architecture imo
Only city in Europe I’ve ever visited where the city centre isn’t the most beautiful part of town

Never heard of it, I've heard a folk music about it tho, in Finnish, so I didn't get a word, but they were moving artillery and playing with guns and it was snowing, so I'll assume it was about it

Biggest one is foreigners, particularly americans think drugs are legal in Portugal, meaning they thinkit is legal to buy, sell, grow, they got this totally different notion (and many get scammed because they are that stupid)

> 4 years ago, that there was a coup in Portugal because the president invited the leader of the most voted party to be government
And then there was another coup because the 2nd most voted party formed the government

I honestly thought dual citizenship was commonplace in the EU, and I don't understand why anyone would be against such a thing
I have dual citizenship, Brazil and Portugal
It would be really messed up if I had to choose one over the other
Indeed we even have the minister of Justice with double nationality (Angolan), today's PSD candidate for Sintra's City Hall is also canadian, I think some of the president's grandchildren are also brazilian and so on
In that case yes, I can see it being a problem

In this type of posts no one usually mentions English but it's actually a very nice sounding language imo
English, with a Glaswegian accent
Not even joking
Italian a close second
Portuguese
Could you explain a little bit more
I don’t have a favorite, I do like some of the preciousness of Italian, and Spanish when spoke by Spanish women
Edit: I also like German, but don’t ask me why
i'm happy that your's is Portuguese
mine is Italian and right after Portuguese, Italian because i would love to be fluent in Italian, Portuguese because the language it's just beautiful, the hardest in the world to learn and i'm blessed that i was born speaking it
it's the other way around tho, Portuguese stands for perfection speaking and Spanish ( which in fluent too ) it's a little more '' drunk Portuguese ''.
I am not sure, I don’t found it particularly appealing, but at the same time there’s something fascinating in it
once I was watching a documentary and the voice-over was really breathtaking, I didn’t understand shit, but it was clearly beautiful (and looking at the subtitles, it was a really excellent text)
on the other way, we tend to be super expressive when we spoke (even if you don’t understand Spanish, Italian or Portuguese, just by the tone and facial expressions you kind of get what they are talking about), they aren’t so much, and that’s intriguing
No, but I get your point
I understand Italian, but I don’t speak very well, what I like about it its the use of expressions and words that are kind of “old school”, which give a certain refinement or elan to it
Is there a country, besides your own, that you don't like seeing insulted or ridiculed
Joking is alright, but some jokes are either tiresome or taken way too far
Personally, I don't like to hear any country being insulted, though ones I feel more strongly than others
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
Spain: don't mess with our hermanos, we're the only ones who get to make fun of them
Britain: it's insulted way too much and very unjustly in most cases
Brazil: Leave Brazil alone
France: the cowardice stereotype needs to die already
Germany: Enough with the Nazi-related stuff, they don't deserve this
Our fellow countries of Southern Europe - the PIGS jokes and "waste money on wine and women" mentally only shows how ignorant some people are
Spain
Basically grew up there
Or us, Spain, Italy and Greece
The PIGS jokes aren't fun anymore
I agree with Britain and Germany
Dude, no one cares anymore about all of that Nazi shit
Stop
And Britain, just, why
They're not more fancy or rich than any other country
People who joke about that just show ignorance and it pisses me off
Portugal
Even though I consider Portugal to be my country along with Brazil, I'm including it because Brazilians love to give the portuguese shit for no reason
Truth of the matter is, the portuguese people are some of the most lovely people I've ever met
Besides that, Germany and Russia
The Greek joke about the ruin economy has one of the most famous Greek ruins is getting really old
Although Its only funny if its in r/Polandball format
Not at all
Besides being a running gag from Monthy Python I don't get it either
I was in Poland for a year, thank god for Erasmus
Got to know their history, their cities, their people
I'm pretty defensive of them now
They're good people and honestly, seeing what we let happen in Poland during WW2, we're a bunch of freaking idiots
How do you feel about the Black Legend
Tell me about it, that's why I never read the comment section on any video about either country
It's really toxic
In real life though, Portuguese and Brazilians get on really well in here, at least from what I have seen
Please don't judge us from the idiots online
I live near Belmonte, and it's always so refreshing to see Brazilian visit the castle and looking so excited
The place is filled with Brazilian flags
I wish our two countries were as close as Britain and the USA
We may fight you but it's like brothers *pissing* on each other, if we see someone else insulting you we turn on our "dad" rage mode and start giving punches in all directions just to protect you
Same thing to all other former colonies
You're cool
Who's insulting Ireland
They're awesome
Aww
Thank you
We love you too :)
That one you can
They got our ships sunk along with theirs
I like german accents
They suck the hs in such a cute way
Reminds me of fish Klaus from American Dad
You can say that again
Hey, thank *you* for treating me so nicely over here
You guys are awesome
Cheers
I love monty python comedy
I wasn't aware of it until rather recently, and wow
That is so horrible and so untrue
I hate when people bring up how horrible the Spanish were, all colonizers were horrible at the time
Leave Spain alone, we're the only ones allowed to make fun of them
> I think he mean jokes in a bad way about the situation of the country
Yup
God, everyone said shit about us during the crisis
Even a couple of months ago had a tourist reminding me of the whole PIGS thing and I was ready to tell him to shove it where the sun doesn't shine
>however almost every time US has invaded a country they've been liberated from a certain totalitarian regime
You *do* know the US doesn't need to directly invade a country to be able to meddle in their politics, correct
Are you aware of how much shit they've done to Latin America, for example
De nada ;)
Americans are very stupid
Fortunately someone else pointed out they elected Trump and he stopped laughing
My father called me janico or janicó, when I was a kid (no idea what it means) and now just meu filho "my son"
I dont know about/cant remember about my parents
but mine is "Puto-Rocha" (literally translated is Rock-Dude") I think my father also has this name
My father treats me as "Cheio de sono" which roughly translates to "Full of sleep"
My mother used to call me "tentilhão" which means chaffinch, a cute small bird ressembling a sparrow which is often found here in Portugal
My grandpa used to call me "picanço", which means shrike and is also a bird but a not so cute one, they eat meat
No idea what my family's obsession with birds is, or how it relates to me, but I still found it cute
Well what about what we call our kids
I call my son many things, but chief among them are "Pirate", "Nocturnal Terror" and "Best thing in the world".
i think i solved that
As far as I know, you can only learn Brazilian Portuguese, which has quite some differences in grammar and vocabulary and a very different pronunciation
I see some "hate" towards Duolingo, but with all respect, I disagree
True, it lacks in some aspects (grammar could be explained better, we have to rely on the community discussions on the forums and other sources for that) but it is a really good app and a great way to get introduced to a language, for free
That being said, I don't think you can become fluent just from Duolingo, but is it helpful
Yes, a lot, specially if you use it properly (you need to build a habit, and don't rush through the lessons, learning a language takes time
Perhaps keeping a notebook of some kind as well)
Of course it's even better when you combine it with other sources of information
Also, the weird sentences you sometimes see are put there on purpose, it's supposed to help you memorise the vocabulary in a fun or different way
After all, learning a language is learning the vocabulary and the grammar rules, not predefined sentences
Some people don't like it, but I think it's good to have a few of those weird sentences alongside the useful ones, it works for me
With that out of the way, my native language is Portuguese, but Duolingo only has Brazilian Portuguese, which is quite different from the European one
Some words and grammar are different, but the biggest difference I'd say it's the pronunciation
I don't know much about the Duolingo course on it, but it seems to be as good as any other Duolingo course
it's teaching Brazilian portuguese and not Portugal Portuguese, although very similar they're quite different in pronnouciation (Brazilian is more sung, while Portugal's is like a Russian meeting a Spanish)
Awful
it will undo any grammatical knowledge you might have
It would be like if someone learnt AAVE posed as standard English
Duolingo in Portuguese is awful, exactly because it's Brazilian Portuguese
Verbal conjugations are impossible to learn correctly when they use third person for second person, frequently mismatch conjugations and ignore that plural you exists
PT-PT and PT-BR is much more different and diverse than British and American English are, in comparison
We, Portuguese, understand them very well because we are exposed to their culture (tv, music and a large immigrant community), but they struggle so much
Like imagine a American movie or series where a British character would speak in a fake British accent that is a mix of the two just so the American audience to understand
That happens quite a lot with Brazilian shows that feature Portuguese actors
It surely will, and I believe it's easier to learn than European Portuguese
You're right, when I said "as good as any other" I meant that it was probably your average Duolingo course, but there are certainly some better than others
I've done the Norwegian course on Duolingo, I can confirm that it is great, it's really well-structured like you said, I loved it
I'm in the middle of the Italian course now, it's not bad at all but feels like it needs an update
Those 2 are the only ones I've tried myself so I don't know what are the not so good courses
I've never done the Portuguese one, I've only seen little bits of it so I don't know for sure how good is it
And yes, I've always thought of Duolingo that way, it's a fun method to get started on a language or practice some vocabulary, it's not there to make you fluent
I certainly enjoy it
My thoughts exactly
> Verbal conjugations are impossible to learn correctly
PT-PT verbal conjugations
The app tells you upfront that it's PT-BR that you are learning
It's not ideally from our POV, but it's understandable from
For me it's worse when you are trying to learn a foreign language, being a PT-PT native, and sometimes you have mistakes in the exercises because you are not used to certain conjugations or expressions in PT-BR
it might have changed since the last time I used it, but it just said it was Portuguese, it did not announce itself as Brazilian Portuguese
also, verbal conjugations are the same in both Pt-Br and Pt-pt, but Duolingo tried to pass Pt-Br coloquial use as if it were the same as formal use, which did not happen in other languages it offers
-video games that have gambling mechanics that involve real world money either directly or indirectly should either be illegal to be sold to minors or at least implement methods that lock that feature out of minor range (if possible)
-although there are a few things that are already illegal here, in Portugal, that this thread mentions i would like to say its not enough making it illegal it needs to be in forced and be human resources capable of doing the inforcement of the law and some social public opinion agreement to work

Bullfighting
I'm not against cigarettes, but I find it odd that it is legal to smoke while driving, and that nobody talks about this
For me, smoking while driving can be as dangerous as talking on the phone while driving and I think it should also be illegal
Not to mention all the cancerous particles that get stuck inside the car
"fuga ao fisco"
Let's say a worker earns 4000€ a month,
he would have to pay the taxes someone who earns 4000€ usually pays
But something which is usually done is claiming you only earn for example 2000€, so he pays the taxes someone who earns 2000€ would pay
In my opinion this is wrong, but not everything is bad, since when that worker retires, his pension will not be the equivalent to a 4000€ wage, but a 2000€ wage
Lol reading this thread has been insane
I had no idea there was so much fantastical thought
I dont think in Portugal we have any, and if we ever did people stopped speaking about them
Not much fantastical lore here
The only one I can remember is we used to say there was a giant at the souther point of Africa and that's why you couldn't cross
But after it was crossed, giant was disproven, name of the place changed and that was that
>A lake monster, that hasnt been reported for over 125 years because it moved to another lake a few cities away
I guess it got tired of being reported to the authorities for existing lol
There are tales of a dragon or cockatrice called Coca that lived in the North of Portugal were is now the town of Monção.
Wait
Europeans hate ceiling fans
Most of the time it's fine, because there's a good correlation between the ending of a noun and its gender, but some common endings like -e, -ão and -r are ambiguous
Plus there's a relatively small amount of possible endings I guess, since you can't end a word on most consonants
It's mostly based on context
Which means the same word could have different articles (mostly on proper names)
For example, "procura no [motor] Google" (masculine) vs "trabalho na [empresa] Google" (feminine)
Yes, in Portuguese we usually know by the way the word ends which is the correct articles
The problems are with foreign words
Nowadays, the biggest problem we have is if we either use masculine or feminine to refer to covid
Most people say "O covid" but I think "A covid" makes more sense
It sounds worse though
It's a bit tricky
for words in Portuguese it's easy to know which article to use by the word ending
for foreign words, we go by the general vibe
Sometimes the same word has a different gender depending on the dialect of Portuguese
For example, sandwich is masculine in pt-br but feminine in all other variants of Portuguese
See in portuguese it easy, nutella ends with an 'a' therefore it is female
Other words might not be this easy
Yeah, you could think of "O vírus covid", but I could see arguments for "A pandemia covid", so I guess both work
Weirdos
Same with Portuguese
O Nutella just sounds weird
I've heard from a friend who is a biologist that if we say sars-covid it's male because that's the virus
If you want to say the disease, it's female because it's a disease
It makes some sense, but still
Specially because it ends with an a :)
*spelling
In Portugal that happens too but with brazilian shows and movies
It’s almost a meme here aswell
in here we have some spanish, french, dannish and german tv shows broadcasting through the public channels and cable
We also have a lot of French movies on our cinemas (and also on cable tv) and due to that I am huge fan of Omar Sy
we also tend to adapt some international tv shows like competitions and spannish tv shows
Here in Portugal it's all American and Brazilian and not much European besides some British, Spanish and French
The ones i hate the most: 1) people that think we are part of Spain or some rebel province that got independence
We are older than Spain, we are one of the oldest nations in Europe 1179, and we are one of the most consistent country in Europe
2) we are lazy and just want to drink alcohol and have spend money on working girls (this one was once said by very well known person about the southern European countries), we are not lazy we work really hard
The one i find amusing is: Portuguese people are everywhere around the world, this one is true (fun fact it's famously appears in the Comic Tintin where a Portuguese guy appears everywhere in even in the most uncommon and unexpected places)
Portuguese people are welcoming, absolutely true in general, (there's the occasional ass, but they are everywhere)
Hate: We're part of Spain, them lot didn't exist when we came into being (n they're a bit of a copy cat like with the whole empire ting n what not, not the other way around)
Amusing: we're lazy, I certainly am ngl but everyone else is very hardworking more so than most other people tbh
Hate: that we're all poor fisherman or some other low skill profession
Find amusing: that Portuguese women have an abnormal amount of facial hair in the area above the upper lip
não é 1179 é 1143 quem não sabe esta data não é bom português :p. O tratado de Zamora é que determinou a independência de Portugal, em 1179 foi só o reconhecimento do Papa, se não estou enganado
>Is it common for tourists to think you guys speak Spanish or as you say actually part of Spain
Not that common but not uncommon, and i mean both
>I've heard speaking Spanish as a tourist in Portugal is a big no no
True in general, let me give you a bit of context, it's because of those 2 things you said above that i quoted first, and because it's seen has a bit rude in the sense that you gives the impression that you think we speak Spanish (we naturally understand Spanish although the Spanish cannot understand Portuguese has we can understand them) and because in general portugues people in general speak very well English, and because it gives the impression that you didn't pay enough attention and try to learn a bit of Portuguese simple words even if badly spoken (we appreciate that a lot because it's a sign of respect for us)
But don't get the wrong idea because we don't really care, we just get a bit annoyed nothing more, if its just Spaniard then we don't really care if he speaks Spanish this is more towards people that aren't native Spanish speakers and know how speak English or French (or any other language) better than anything or Spanish
A friend of mine worked near an airport and once got some American lady be shocked that she wasn't in Spain, and was completely unaware that Portuguese was even a thing
Another friend of mine always purposely gives the wrong directions to tourists who ask him in Spanish or say "gracias" (unless they are native Spanish speakers speaking their native language, of course)
Sim, mas Internationalmente é só com o manifestis probatum que Portugal é reconhecido por toda a cristandade o que fez dele oficialmente um país independente ao olhos de toda a cristandade, não basta só um país a reconhecer para ser se país é preciso o reconhecimento de vários e com a manifestis probatum tem isso, é por isso que oficialmente é em 1179 e não em 1143
Apesar de 1143 ser bastante importante na nossa história não é oficialmente o nosso começo aos olhos da comunidade internacional da altura, isso é o mais importante porque assegura vários privilégios poderes de soberania completa e segurança/confiança.

But something here is that I am close to the Atlantic so it might be really hot at 2 pm, but it gets really windy and cool on late afternoon, so sometimes you just wear sleeves or something hotter
Also noticeable, in Lisbon we got lots of foreigners living there and you can see tribes
People from clearly cooler places, start wearing shorts and short sleeves much before locals
People from the tropics are wearing their padded coats in May and really wrapped up
around 10°C maybe
most people look a bit surprised though so uh idk maybe like 15-20° is more normal
I'm yet to wear short sleeves this year and I live in Portugal, so yeah
You get the point
Same, if there's Sun out 15ºC is more than enough for me
T-shirt and shorts weather definitely
If it's cloudy/windy I might push with a jacket though
I've never gotten dizzy because of heat
I've never gotten a heatstroke either
I worked a lot with furnaces and I had to be like 1-1
5m away from a fire that would go over 1000ºC sometimes
My resistance to temperature is really high on both ends of the spectrum
I would also finish the night shift at that place with furnaces and go home to take a cold shower at 5am no problem
My condolences for that heat wave
Gotta get some AC in there
And make sure the attic is insulated as well as having white blinds on the windows towards the sun
I started working in 2014 and it was a fucking circus
You didn't have the luxury of choice
Salaries hit rock bottom
You got out of university with a master's degree and were lucky if you got 700€/month
Today things are better, unemployment is the lowest in 17 years, you can negotiate salaries and if you have an IT degree or related you can get an initial offer around 1200€.
The downside is that real estate prices went through the roof
In Lisbon and Porto it's almost impossible to rent or buy if you're alone
Even for couples it's not easy
Winning the Euro 2016 and the Eurovision 2017
I can't really express how much these two events changed the morale around these parts
Also, we went from a right-wing government set on implementing austerity measures to
whatever thing we had the last 4 years
Also, we just had an election and finally a right-wing party made its way into the parliament (although it's a bit of a joke party, not at all what we see elsewhere in Europe)
Other than that, it's the same as always
I almost googled the date of the last UEFA Euro
Like isn't that always on even years
In my mind every EU member has the same currency, except UK
Who is considered a national hero in your country
Someone people in your country still look up to and admire for their deeds
We have:
Viriato - Lusitanian tribe leader who fought the Romans
Brites de Almeida, the baker of Aljubarrota  - after the battle of Aljubarrota, she killed several Castillian soldiers with a shovel
Might have been a myth, but people still admire her
King Afonso Henriques - gave the country indepence from Léon, absolute badass who counquered from the Minho to Lisbon
Vasco da Gama - sea explorer, found the sea route to India
Luís Vaz de Camões - poet, wrote the biggest Portuguese epic poem, the Lusiads
Studied both in Portugal and Brazil
Fernando Pessoa - poet, wrote our best poems in recent literature
Also studied in Brazil
The April Captains - overthrew a 60 year old dictatorship with no bloodshed
Aristides de Sousa Mendes - saved thousands of Jews from the Nazis by allowing them to flee to Portugal
Not to rain on your parade or anything like that but I think I should mention that the Aljubarrota baker’s name is actually Brites de Almeida and she was not a real person
Even though her story is retold lots of times she’s actually a myth
You said it all
OP, how could you forget Aristide de Sousa Mendes
Camões poet that wrote an epic, he save the epic from being destroyed by a shipwreck accident, he was also a soldier, and the day of the nation his also his
>-Vercingétorix: Celtic gaul leader who fought against Julius ceasar
Anyone who's read Astérix knows of him hehe
Also, I wouldn't consider her a national figure on the level of Vasco da Gama, but more of a fun legend
It's not like she had an actual influence on Portuguese history
Oh, right
I'll ad him to list
Terra da fraternidade
From what I read, Franco wanted to conquer Portugal but he didn't get the support from Hitler to do so, he even had a plan to do it in 24 hours
However, Portugal and Spain had the Iberian pact of non agression, and by staying neutral and later  offering support to Britain and the US, Portugal's role was to keep Spain neutral as well
Later, after the Carnation Revolution in 1974, Franco was furious and thought someone would try the same in Spain so he wanted to invaded Portugal again out of fear of the Red Menace
That's why he even tried to convince the United States to help (the CIA did some questionable things here in Portugal after the revolution to "save us" from comunism), but he died next year and then nothing became of it
Agreed
I think we like to tell that story because of our love hate relationship with the Spanish and the thought of a single Portuguese woman beating up seven Spanish guys and putting them in the oven to make pão com chouriço is pretty cool
We suck at land, but the sea was ours
Nowadays, we mostly fight Spanish fishermen though
I'm a bit late to this party but my grandfather was arrested during the revolution of 25th of April in Portugal because he blocked access to weaponry (guns, granades, vehicles, etc etc) from the revolutionaries
I sadly don't know more details because I never met the guy
Oh well
Well I don't think my country has declared itself a Roman empire successor but if I had to say I think the Roman empire had a lot of sucessors in a way
Bruv this is a russain byzantine Italian German thing
Drinking alcohol in the street being socially acceptable and understanding the difference between socialism and social democracy
No I'm speaking of drinking in the street, also there might be law or not depending on where you are and even then they exist they might not be in force because it's socially acceptable
I don't know about Lithuania but from what i heard countries of Latin roots and Germany it's generally acceptable to drink in public in the street
Well from what i know and heard Latin rooted countries and Germany it's socially acceptable to drink in public, so i would that's largely popular
He (like Mandrake and some others) was semi-popular here in Portugal back in the 60s-70s, but not nowadays
You see some English mixed with Portuguese endings
Like speedar (to speed) or speedado (being full of energy/on a rush)
Rapar (to rap, but it can also be read as shave)
Googlar, a Portuguese verb for "Google it
Smoking and lifting we use as well, but a footing is more of hygienic walk
Jogging we just call correr
We here call box to garages in buildings that are individually enclosed spaces (like a box), as opposed to building that have parking lot-type of garages
It's not weed or hash they're selling
It's laurel leaves and bouillon cubes
gas prices
Sometimes taxi cab drivers charge you much more than they should when you start speaking English
It's horrible
Good alternatives: Uber and Lyft
Shmucky restaurants and caffés with no fixed menu (on purpose) will also do that sometimes if you don't speak fluent Portuguese, although it's much less than taxis and getting rarer
Still, beware
Adding to this, sometimes even if you ask to smell it they will burn a tip of the corner that has a little amount of hash, the rest is still a bouillon cube
The German automotive industry still produces some of the best cars on the entire planet, if not the best (I'm not including sports brands like Ferrari, Lambhorghini, McLaren, etc
So people will still buy them
I have a Mercedes for example
It's obviously a urban myth but I don't know how people believe in it
that my first grade teacher would beat and bulli kids with learning problems, like me i have dyslexia, and got away scot free (the school fail doing anything so i would say the education system also fail because of this) (this was in 2005/6)
the stress cause by lack of time for learning everything in the programe
thankfully this problems don't exist in universtity at least not in law school
Schoolbooks are needlessly expensive and frequently changing
Religion is taught on schools
Physical Education teachers are generally awful
I seriously doubt both have much in common these days
Haggis in Ireland
It is delicious
I ate it at breakfast everyday
I feel the same way
Usually dislike cucumber in salads and sandwiches (I just don't like the taste and smell
) but tzatziki is awesome
I actually did, I did find any difference
they were both good ngl
Yes, in every hotel
My trip was Lisbon-Dublin-Liverpool-Manchester-the highlands- Edinburgh-Lisbon
Generally most if not all our flags that we had are liked but there are some people who like certain ones or certain elements, like colour scheme, better
Honestly, the House of Braganza colors really doesn't go with the stars and stripes
We call the palm slap game "sardine game", jogo da sardinha, don't ask me why, no, there's no fish involved, but there's lot of hand slappin'.
I've honestly never had someone ask me to do that
Literally the only phrase I know
We like to say we hate the Spanish, but it's more of a joke
Castile used to be our arch-enemy
Picture this scenario: Sweden conquers all of Scandinavia except Denmark
Then, it changes its name to "Scandinavia" and its Swedish language is now called "Scandinavian". That's what Castile did in Iberia
I can't see Portugal and Republican Spain being enemies at all, because this version of Spain recognizes its heterogenous nature
It's in fact a union of Iberian people
Spain - gieb Olivença back
Not a real issue or grievance but it's legally ours and it would make a hell of a boost in our relations
Brasil - Stop whining about the gold Portugal took while you were a colony and our crown was responsible for the mining operations and control of it
We spent it in church altars and luxury imports, setting our country in a spiral of hand-out culture that to this day still lingers on
It was worst for us than not having so much
Angola - We're tired of your inferiority complex
Everything wrong in your corrupt so called democracy is still our fault
After 45 years of independence
That's verrrry fanny, für a Gerrman
>but it's sometimes considered to be tiny and less important than Spain
If that helps you deal with the trauma of getting your ass kicked every single time you tried to mess with us
But really
Yeah, every single Spanish I met in person and the comments I've seen online, seem to like us
The Spanish are like "We love our Iberian hermanos
". And the Portuguese are like "We're gonna eat them all, caralho
“Tiny”
Bruh
that hurt
In 1940s the Portuguese population organized one of the biggest charity events to help struggling Finland
We gathered enormous amounts of food and clothing
Then, in the crisis of 2009 you shit on us and refused to help us and argued against anyone helping us
Just saying
We have the same problems with Brazil
They speak a very simplified and informal version of Portuguese
Yet, it's the most recognised version and people say it sounds better
I'm not Spanish and I have a problem with it
This is Iberia goddamn it
Wanna go for some Reconquista
I agree in what you say about the borders
Not our fault either
Portugal wasn't listened in the Vienna treaty and just accepted the borders established by it
And that's why I mention Angola and no other former colonies
There are a few ethnic problems in the country but no common hatred as in other African countries
But, Angola has oil, diamonds, gold and agricultural richnesses that other countries in Africa dream of but whenever something happens, there comes the hatred against the former coloniser
We gave them what was rightfully theirs 45 years ago
is it our fault they chose to create a cleptocracy instead of a country where all citizens can reap the richnesses of it
Obviously it is unfortunate
Worst than senile, those people who divided Africa had absolutely no respect for the people that occupied those lands
It's appalling the lack of notion they had that these were human beings, just like they were
Nowadays,  creating a nation for each of the people in Africa would mean creating more than 300 new countries, most of them not viable because they would have no resources, access to water, etc
There is no easy way to solve all the territorial issues in Africa
Let's hope they can work together to solve the problem we europeans left them with
Maybe Coimbra since it also lacks a big football team and it's very far away from the major tourist hotspots (Lisbon, Porto, Algarve)
In Portugal, many of the cities near Lisbon and Porto (as in, part of their metropolitan areas) get overshadowed by them, I guess
You won't hear a foreigner talking about Vila Nova de Gaia, Cascais e Loures, despite the fact that they are all in the top 6 biggest cities
Académica is a fairly big club, just going through a bad phase right now
Brazilians do recognize the name of Coimbra because of the university, I really wouldn't expect non-lusophone foreigners to know our cities names beyond Lisbon or Porto
Coimbra is famous
Braga or Setúbal are a better choice
Padua is know for its univeristy
and in Portugal, also because of St
Anthony
football fans might recognize the name of Maribor
Was going to say the same
Império Austro-Húngaro
Literally the same
We are poor
Although hardworking we are not well organized, I guess we rely too much on our ability to improvise and turn things around
That's common in all of Souther Europe
Portugal is the same
Is fucking annoying
Same in Portugal
I would kill for that over here
Everyone is always late and I cannot stand it
Not quite
There are Chico espertos in Portugal but nothing we love so much as to expose one for that and punish him/her
Italy is a bit different, IMO
It is a bit shocking in a way, literally no shame on some things
Give it a few years, you will one day be celebrating the day you surpass Portugal on the list
To change the constitution here, the law must have at least two thirds of approval on the parliament and the approval of the President
That's the current constitution, though
We've had constitutions for a while longer than the current one, since 1822 I believe
«Esquilo» =  (i)ʃˈkilu
I assume I was supposed to use IPA, otherwise, sounding it out in english, might make it more ambiguous
I'm not aware of foreigners struggling with pronouncing it, but I guess it might ultimately depend on what's their native language
I've never heard a foreigner use the word esquilo tbh
Squirrels aren't really a common subject of discussion here
'shkey-loo, more or less
You are right
Portugal doesn't have a lot of squirrels
They were actually considered extinct until the 1980's when reintroduction started
Still today you will only find them sporadically in some rural areas
For most of the population, dolphins and flamingos are a more common sight than squirrels
It blew my mind when I moved to Germany and there were squirrels living in the middle of cities
First time I saw squirrels was in London
I am from Porto and never saw a squirrel there
'Rata' (singular) is a slang for
huh
lady bits in Portuguese, so there's that
I'd say they're more for people who are having trouble keeping up with certain subjects
At leas that was the case for me
I had a maths tutor because I just so happened to miss the class where they taught us division and ever since I've been a bit behind
When it came to studying for the final exams some teachers had extra study sessions that were optional
I did a few Geometry ones for instance
We'd do exercices and ask the teacher for help if we needed any
Some do, but you can enter the degree you want by studying with relative ease, it's not that competitive
I would say that in Portugal is quite competitive to go to the uni
meh, maybe this year will be competitive, but unless for a few select courses you don't need to have near perfect grades
And in many countries the average dont even count at all
in other countries the selection is after the first year of university or through processes that favor the urban rich
ours is more objective
Our country has higher temperatures, so yes, we keep them in the fridge
Nah
They are good on room temperature, plus they get eaten in like max 3 weeks
Football
Beer
Super Bock (mostly North) vs
Sagres (mostly South)
Those guys in the south really love drinking piss
Is Napoletana the thin one
Aight, I'm a Romana fan I guess
I hate thick soggy pizza
Ao limite eu vou by Non-stop
always always comes up
In Portugal I think the most common one is Minha Casinha by Xutos e Pontapés. Also any fado song like Perfeito Coração by Amália Rodrigues, because we all know the lyrics
Maybe there’s songs from popular singers too like Toy, Marco Paulo, Tony Carreira, etc
But I only been to a karoke twice, so take it with a grain of salt
I've always known it as Dragostea din tei, I don't think anyone called it Numa Numa here
"O homem do leme" and "casinha" are always there 2
"Vaai quem já nada teme, vai o homemmm do leeeemeee eee". It's so ubiquitous that I can't even hear it in my head without it being severely out of tune and/or screamed
Normally 8h or 14h if night train
I do not feel like checking but I do not think Copenhagen-Zurich would fit my rules, but I can imagine doing it in vacation one way
It is not a complicated route
But continuing to Milan would be too long
I would need a break
I lived in Zurich for some time and I would travel to all its neighboring countries by train
Several times I did Zurich-Italian cities by train
Max till Naples
I compare the prices and time of travel to make a decision
So I can't give an fixed answer
Unless you concept of economic spectrum has swung incredibly to the right (common in the last decades) I wouldn't say so
The focus of christian-democracy is still a national organic polity, where the insurance based health care model or co-determination have a role within social concertation
Business leaders, right-wing parties and the right-wing faction of the social-democratic party managed to win the public conversation
By the way [ABBA manifested against it as well]
>When the Swedish Social Democrats proposed the same idea in 1982, the pop group behind “The Winner Takes It All” and “Money, Money, Money” helped lead opposition to the proposal, producing pamphlets and even hosting an open air gig to protest
In the end, ABBA saw off the socialist menace
The idea was watered down by the Swedish government, then scrapped in the 1990s.
I dunno
I can't recall ever seeing Portugal portrayed in a foreign movie
Apparently we're in South America
Russians in the new CoD are literally monsters, i wonder how russians feel about being portraid this way
Big oof
Oh God, that restaurant scene
It's like they placed every single Portuguese stereotype into one room
So true, its ridiculous, i mean, russians did invade afghanistan, but they didnt enslave them ffs, and russia already had women fighting in ww1
And its hillarious that part where a few female prisioners who some have never held weapons simply kill hundreds of trained russian soldiers as they escape
No I can't. Never learned how to
We apologise for the defective model
Please, send her back
We will deal with the problem immediately and send you a new one that can use bicycle
I learned to ride when I was 4-5 years old
Jokes apart,  I don't know if its cultural or just the people around me,  but most girls I know couldn't ride a bicycle to save their lives
I can't, it always surprises people when I tell them lol
well i am also from portugal and I learned at 4 years old
I live in Portugal and as much as I love the country, the use of public space just makes me sad
Every square centimeter is dedicated to cars, urban planning is non-existent and people either go to the gym or get fat at 30
A country where you can bike, run and swim (ocean is 15° in January
) all year, but nobody does
Such amazing nature everywhere and such callous care for it
Things are slowly changing, but it's still a 1970s mentality in many ways
I don't think I know anyone who doesn't know how to ride a bicycle
is not learning how to ride a bicycle a city thing or
Then the kid realizes it and immediately falls because he's looking backwards
> ocean is 15° in January
Dude, get out of here, that's cold as fuck
I'm 29 and don't hit the gym, but I'm still thin
I live in Lisboa
This is a city built on 7 hills
Not very suitable for biking
There were practically no bike lanes in the city until this decade
Nowadays there's some and you see some people biking
Maybe in flatter parts of the country people bike more, dunno
Running in a big city doesn't seem practical
Nobody swims
They do when it's hot
Or they just swim in indoor pools when it's colder
It's very rare to run into someone who can't swim here
I was born and raised in the capital
Lived in Lisboa all my life
I don't care much about nature
Looks pretty in pictures but that's it
> is not learning how to ride a bicycle a city thing or
It definitely factors into it
Not really needing it, because public transportation is good or the fact you live near "everything" and can walk everywhere, plus living in an apartment and not having the space to keep a bike
Add that to non-existent bycicle infrastructure (proper lanes, proper parking spaces and so on) plus Portuguese drivers and roads being a bit on the dangerous side and you have a ton of people who never really saw the benefit of learning how to bike
And then, this is cyclical
If your parents were not also never into biking, then they're not going to push you into it either
By the time you start considering being more mobile and needing to make bigger trips, you're probably nearing 18 and you'll go straight into applying for your driver's license
No idea
I've personally never had a bicycle or saw any desire or need to own one and learn how to ride it
> I'm 29 and don't hit the gym, but I'm still thin
You've got one year to join a gym my friend
> I live in Lisboa
This is a city built on 7 hills

Nowadays there's some and you see some people biking
Maybe in flatter parts of the country people bike more, dunno
I also live in Lisbon and I bike everywhere
> Running in a big city doesn't seem practical
People run everywhere, in particular in bigger cities
And Lisbon actually has great places to run (river bank, Monsanto, Bela Vista, ...), but almost nobody does
> Nobody swims
They do when it's hot
Or they just swim in indoor pools when it's colder
It's very rare to run into someone who can't swim here
People can swim, but there are very few actual swimmers
I swim all year round in the ocean (with a suit) and I only saw another person once
> I was born and raised in the capital
Loved in Lisboa all my life
I don't care much about nature
Looks pretty in pictures but that's it
I can respect that
I was mainly reacting to the OP, and I was not surprised to read that the girl in the story was Portuguese
It's an outdoor paradise for a people that could not care less about the outdoors
In the Netherlands, where I lived before, there is almost no nature to speak of really and people just make so much of what little they have, it's amazing
And you can really see the effect that has on their body and mind
>You've got one year to join a gym my friend
My brother is close to 40, doesn't exercise and is still thin
So what makes you think I'll get fat
>I also live in Lisbon and I bike everywhere
Good for you, I guess
>People run everywhere, in particular in bigger cities
But Lisbon actually has great places to run (river bank, Monsanto, Bela Vista, ...), but almost nobody does
So what
Let people do whatever they want
>People can swim, but there are very few actual swimmers
I swim all year round in the ocean (with a suit) and I only saw another person once
That type of swimmer you are that requires a suit probably requires you to be a better swimmer than average
Most people aren't gonna be into that
I assume surfers wear similar suits
>I can respect that

Paradise
Don't other European countries have that kind of stuff
Hey, half of what I wrote is tongue in cheek
People can run and not run, swim or not swim, but we're often discussing cultural differences on this sub
I don't know if you have every lived in other countries in Europe, but Portugal is a pretty special place
The diversity in nature is staggering and for someone like me, who grew up in a cold and dark place, the opportunities are endless
Swimming in the ocean all year round, it's too amazing to put into words
But yeah, I am often really surprised that people make so little use of the splendor they have been given and I do believe that they would lead happier lives if they'd go out a little more, learn how to bike and leave the car at home sometimes
>Hey, half of what I wrote is tongue in cheek
People can run and not run, swim or not swim, but we're often discussing cultural differences on this sub
I don't know if you have every lived in other countries in Europe, but Portugal is a pretty special place
No I haven't.
14th century discovery (Iberian peninsula)
*a game about the 1980s/90s during the Berlin Wall period, maybe about escaping or the perspective of people when the wall fell what was like
*a game about WW2 telling real stories of people who helped Jews or other minorities escape
*a game about ancient Greece, either a philosophy type strategy card game or about mythology
Sometimes we call Spain "nuestros hermanos" (our brothers)
same for portugal
We call Spaniards "Nuestros hermanos " or "cabroes". Depends on the mood
Started in 1939, ended in 1945
Germany lost
We were not in it, but many refugees fled through here
Lisbon was spy central
The goverment allowed the US and UK air force to land in the Azores
I'd say it's covered pretty extensively
Focuses a lot more on the European Theatre but it does touch on the Pacific Theatre a tad as well
I remember studying the reasons why Germany went to war (Versailles and 'living space' mostly), and how Hitler continuously overreached before the war (Austria and Czechoslovakia), so Poland was the last straw for the Allies
The map that most schools had didn't say "Portugal is the size of Europe" it usually said something along the lines of "Portugal isn't as small as it seems" or something close to that with a map of Europe with our ex-colonies over it, and don't forget the cross that was in most classrooms enforcing the whole supposed connection Portugal had with god that dates since the foundation of Portugal since our first king was carrying out the dream of his father who was a cruzado, if I remember correctly he came to help in the reconquista from france and our first flag comes from that
my dude there are even stories of portuguese kings who allowed muslims to stay even after their cities were conquered
there were no genocides there were only wars
You also said that there were plenty of genocidy stuff going on during the Reconquista which is a lie
Turkey is a bit less common than chicken but nonetheless pretty common
Most typically [with mushroom sauce] or [breaded] And a lot of families eat a whole roasted turkey on Christmas Day
Duck is also quite popular, but almost exclusively in the form of [duck rice]
Partridge, pigeon and quail are a thing, but not a thing most people have tried, especially in urban areas
I've never heard of eating goose here
In Portugal the two more common are duck (specially [on rice] and quail (I think grilled whole), as part of the traditional food
I think I've eaten pigeon, but only once and not in a restaurant, so am unsure if that's a thing
And there was a time in which ostrich farms could be found frequently in mainland Portugal, but it isn't part of traditional cuisine and I don't think it ever became mainstream
Besides Chicken, the most common you can find in Supermarkets/Butchers would be Turkey (very common, but less so than chicken), and then Duck
Quail and Partridge(Perdiz) are not unknown, but TBH I never saw them for sale
Duck rice,  is one of of our most popular traditional dishes
I think most supermarkets sell duck, and further some sell packages with the deboned duck in strips and a container of the duck broth so people can make their own homemade duck rice
Other than that in trendier, more modern restaurants, duck can be on other dishes like brás-style or duck magret or other duck dishes
Turkey is very very common, lots of school meals with it
Pigeon is relatively popular specially for pigeon canja (like congee) and sometimes can be found
Quail also
Goose is very rare
Partridge is a traditional gourmet food here, it is very rare to find it on supermarkets, might be found on some high end traditional restaurants occasionally (empada de perdiz, perdiz à convento de Alcântara)
Hunters might eat a few more birds, like pheasants or galinhola, wild duck, a few others
> ostrich
Man, I miss ostrich steaks
Those were so gooood
It's really good
Duck rice is that universal dish
If you don't know what  your guests like or what to serve, serve duck rice
Almost everyone likes duck rice
If you ask any Portuguese at random, a likely answer would be Barreiro
It's an industrial town and has some soviet architecture like buildings
It kinda looks like *those* places from eastern Europe
But, as it goes for most things in Portugal, the weather and the nature kind of makes it more tolerable
Here's a few pictures: [1] [2] [3]
I've seen videos and photographs of Norilisk, and while I'd never actually want to live there it looks fascinating
I would love to be able to visit it someday
Basically the entire Margem Sul (and I'm from there)
Not really, Barreiro is the worst
You have nice places by the beach
Also montijo is getting better
Cacém is also ugly as f... thousands getting away from war in Africa let's put them all in the same place
Yes, when you put it in perspective with other entries on this thread, it's not that bad indeed
It's still pretty bad for Portugal standards
There are many reasons for disliking living in Portugal
At least being an ugly place isn't one of them, I guess
This area was almost entirely built during the 70s, when there was a communist counter-revolution
This used to be an industrial area
Then they built a lot of these awful flats surrounding the now abandoned factories
A common sight in these areas are brick chimneys with nothing else
Ah Cacém... Cacém is Barreiro's brother
I find it even worst because it's claustrophobic -- too many people living in one place
I dread driving through Cacém.
There are some good places, but most of Almada and Seixal are very ugly, even though its getting better every year
Its all the same 70's buildings
I always say that Barreiro is the southern Cacém.
As things are going in terms of rents around Lisbon, I wouldn't mind ownig a flat in one of those 70's buildings in Seixal or Almada
I wouldn't mind at all
And now, with all the construction, Cascais is Cacém Maritima
I have quite a northern accent that most of the country really enjoys mocking
Besides people from Azores island, mine is probably the most funny
Also the frequency we use bad words like "foda-se" or "caralho" helps a lot
Yes because I have a strong accent from Algarve and sometimes I say an expression/word that it doesnt exist in the normal language like - mõh té diebbb; almareado; alcagoita; moçe....
Continental Portugal makes fun of accents from the islands of Madeira and azores
When they try to imitate the accent from Madeira, they unknowingly do the accent from azores which are totally different
Even in the tiny island of Madeira, there’s at least 3 micro accents
Not really
I do remember that when I worked as a waiter and would speak English that I'd tone down my accent and eventually just speak with a Portuguese one because I got tired of everyone asking about my life story
Ok só nessa frase meteste aí uns 3 dialetos diferentes do norte do país. Na zona de Viseu dizem "ejemplo", em trás os montes acentuam um bocado os "r" como em "rrresto" e o trocar v por b é comum no porto e Minho, como dizer "baca". Mas nós acentuamos mais as vogais que no sul do país, por isso "els falm" é algo que muito provavelmente não ouvirias no norte, seria mais algo do género "eles faloum".
Viseu não é norte
German people know how to pronounce *loch* correctly
Just a quick question is there some general anxiety in the Netherlands because of the way you have land
Or do most people don't really care about the possibility of the water rising
Há, meaning either "there is" or "ago", and à, roughly "to the".
besides the à/há, also insane when people use the grave diacritic on words other than à or its derivatives (àquela, às)
also hádes instead of hás-de
a common mistake in common language is to regularize Haver de into a single verb HADER  and say
"to the" is indeed what makes most sense as "à" means "a a" (which is contracted to "à"), where the first "a" means "to", and the second means "the".
Adding to this, people who say things like "fizes te" instead of "fizeste".
One typical of my neck of the woods: failing to adjust for number when using "a gente" (ex: using "a gente vamos" instead of "a gente vai")
For the not portuguese savvy: in the south of Portugal (and in Brazil too, I guess), it's common to use "a gente" (which roughly means "the people") where you would use "nós" ("we")
This makes the verb switch from its 1st person plural conjugation to its 3rd person singular form, but many people skip that part
Yeah, and thanks for clarifying that for other people reading, I said "roughly" because prepositions never really correspond one to one in different languages, e.g. "à tarde" isn't "to the afternoon" but "in the afternoon".
Speaking of which, people who say "fizestes" instead of "fizeste".
I'm from the Center and we use "a gente" sometimes as well
And it's different in European Portuguese actually, we use "Porque é que" for your "Por que" in questions for instance
I get the feeling PT-BR is more complicated there
Yeah, I didn't mean that it is unheard of further north: it's just that it's *way* more common in the south
And in Portugal as well, sadly
I was blown away
Even though I had seen NY in some many shows and movies and knew what to expect, actually being there was amazing
It really did feel like being in a concrete jungle
I only got to see Manhattan (and even then there was a lot I didn't explore), but loved it
It's definitely a place I'd like to go back to one day, and hopefully I'll get to explore the other boroughs too
The only thing that didn't impress me that much was the subway
Made me appreciate the metro in Lisbon a lot more
Didn't know Fallout 3 had such High Res RTX mods
Though breaks immersion for trying to hard to look derelict
Same in Portugal, idk the reason why
The reason is because she's from hawaii (havaí) so "haVaiana".
No, never
*knocks on wood*
Hopefully it will never happen
I was groped by a another classmate for several months when I was 14
I was told to just ignore it since we were both girls and she was just messing around, despite how many times I asked her to stop and explained that she was hurting me
One day I finally punched her in the face, that made her stop
My mom's car radio was stolen 4 times, and they also broke all her windows
I got in a fight in a club
My friends say it wasn't my fault, it was the other dude who hit me first for no reason
I was too drunk to remember
If that's true, it's technically violence
This is the maximum guilty pleasure
It's a kind of music made for older generations with funny lyrics
but it's so much guilty pleasure that's acceptable to play at any party
I strongly recommend that you translate de lyric
[Parte-me o Pescoço] by Agir
Agir is a really cringey rapper/singer, and is the son of a telenovela actress and Portuguese singer/composer
Most of his music seems designed to be catchy and radio friendly, and so it sounds very artificial and manufactured
But *Parte-me o Pescoço* is a legitimate bop
We used to play it ironically at our uni parties/dinners, but I genuinely think it's a fun track to listen to
The [lyrics are stupid but catchy] and I remember one time going to NOS Alive festival and he was the starting act on the main stage
He gave a good show and it was a fun time
Ah, Amy Leeanius, great Lithuanian singer
They exist, but they're not common in Portugal
Windows that open by sliding horizontally are the most common
oscilobatente
I don´t think they are super duper advanced windows, but they are the norm now for newly installed windows
The seal is a lot better which improves thermal and sound insulation
You may have those big tech companies, but we invest our money where it really matters
They exist, they're just more expensive than sliding windows, which are more common
Plus, they don't work when you want double windows (not double-pane), because we all have roller shutters here
> They exist, but they're not common in Portugal
Windows that open by sliding horizontally are the most common
Yeah, I think I only started seeing these here in Portugal about 10 years or so ago
They are becoming more common, though
Pretty much every new building or renovated house will have these nowadays
Portuguese YouTube is probably the worst of thing on the internet
I am from Portugal and there are lots of portuguese youtubers that I like, but for me these three are the best: RicFazeres, Tji, Morais
RicFazeres does gameplay and vlogging comedical videos
His videos are aimed at younger audiences, though I would say that even adults can enjoy his content
He is a very good youtuber and a good person
Here is his channel's link:
Tji does podcasts and storytimes, where he talks about his stories and experiences
His videos are aimed at older audiences, most precisely at young adults, I would say
He also does music too
Here is his channel's link:
Morais does podcasts, reacts and interviews and he is really funny
Morais usually doesn't really make YouTube videos, he does streams, but his streams are on youtube
His videos are aimed to late teenagers/young adults
Here is his channel's link:
For the life of me, I actually can't remember any Portuguese Youtuber that isn't utter trash
If anyone know any interesting one please say so, since from what I've seen Portugal has a definite lack of quality ahah
Dude u have pewds, wtf
Rui Unas
Well, we used to have people like Miguel Luz
Check out Bernardo Bacalhau, he's a refreshing travel filmmaker
Remedy e CCVilhena
I used to like Cager On Two Wheels back when he started the channel and was sharing his experience learning to ride and giving tips to new riders
As expected his growth as a rider stagnated as he learned most of what there's to learn and his content became a narrated streetview trip
Like a TV series that just keeps going when it should've ended 5 seasons ago
CarOnlineTV is another one that I think it's good but I've only seen a few videos since I'm not that much into the topic
I used to watch sexy funny kitchen, they were funny and did great recipes, but then they broke up it changed a bit and i don’t watch it anymore
I'm glad you remained sane
Well yeah, but YouTube is not his main source, he didn't started there u know
I remembered Diogo bataguas now, he's probably my favourite atm but I don't if he started with YouTube, probably not
True, he still does some interesting things like his podcast "janela aberta" but he also kinda abandoned YouTube
Will do
Deadd
I think basically the same, mostly aimed at lil kids but there's also some funny/good ones
They're s much bigger country with a consequent bigger influence so they have more Diversity ig
Who
Tens aqui um aviso /u/ForeverJamon, deixar ir o gato e lá se vai a tua fan-base
Ok, i guess he doesnt like pewds, thats weird, he's the best imo
I know what you mean
"Pure" YouTubers
If we think like that, there is really not much to go into
Not really, Remedy is doing livestreams consistently and uploading highlights on YouTube while uploading random videos every now and then
CCVilhena, while he hasn't posted un 2 months has finished his best ever series that made him triple his subs and really puy his name out there
Also there's RicFazeres, while for a more childish audience is still a youtuber that uploads regularly and it's good, you simply can't deny that from Riczão.
There's also Feromonas, while not consistent anymore I know he'll comeback to take his number 1 spot from that SirKazzio guy (well by that time either D4rk or Wuant will already be there I guess)
Exactly my point though, pure portuguese YouTube is shit (kazzio, numeiro, merdas assim)
All dead channels with no views whatsoever for some reason
CCVilhena has in his 5 previous videos, 1 above a million, 3 above 500k and 1 just reaching 500k. He hasn't posted in 2 months but that's because of the aftermath of his success documentary
RicFazeres on the other hand uploads 2/3 times a day, still gets from 15k to 80k views on a bad month for him since kids are restarting school again, for a country like ours even 50k should be considered a good number since we have old population
EDIT: Remedy still averages 10 to 30k and is uploading every week
Feromonas while not uploading for 2 months and averaging 15k views (sad noises) still has the power to make big comeback since he teasered a comeback of his best series (and best ever portuguese series in terms of Minecraft) and got 300k, for a "dead" youtuber on the other side of the world isn't bad huh
I honestly never heard of Vilhena but the other ones, man that's dead
The portuguese language on YouTube has a lot of viewers thanks to Brazil
15k views is not awful, at least they're still getting views and doing what they love, but that isn't a lot of views
Yes
It's the standard
We start doing that when we're kids/teens
It's common, but it's more common for men who already know each other to pair it with a back pat
Dogs definitely
I find cats incredibly boring
Nationally I think the sentiment is towards dogs as well, but I'm not sure how it is in big cities
Galician-Portuguese hasn't been a language for at least 700 years bro
In Portugal there is [Mirandese]
> The Mirandese language (...) is an Astur-Leonese language or language variety that is sparsely spoken in a small area of northeastern Portugal in the municipalities of Miranda do Douro, Mogadouro and Vimioso
> Mirandese is a descendant of the Astur-Leonese variety spoken in the Kingdom of León and has both archaisms and innovations that differentiate it from the modern varieties of Astur-Leonese spoken in Spain
In recognition of these differences, and due to its political isolation from the rest of the Astur-Leonese speaking territory, Mirandese has adopted a different written norm to the one used in Spain for Astur-Leonese
Lexically, it shares a lot of vocabulary with Portuguese
The most famous cultural thing about the people from the region where this language is spoken is the [Pauliteiros de Miranda]
There is only one other language in Portugal, it’s the only other official language and you’ve never heard of it:
Mirandés
It’s spoken in one village in the north, it’s a hybrid of old portuguese and old castillan, and sounds somewhere between spanish galician and portuguese (with a northern accent)
Well there's Mirandese which is spoken by like 15k people
Some corrections:
There are a couple other minority languages: Minderico and Barranqueno are/were spoken in Minde and Barrancos but are almost extinct
Portugal has three official languages: Portuguese, Mirandese and Portuguese Sign Language
Mirandese is spoken in a region, Miranda do Douro, not a village
It is not a hybrid of Portuguese and Old Castilian, but a descendent of a third Iberian branch of romance languages: Astur-Leonese, that somewhat formed a continuum between Galician-Portuguese and Castilian
It does sounds like what you described, but then again, so does Galician and Leonese (albeit with different ratios of "Portuguese" and "Castillian")
>All these languages developed due to the isolation during the moorish conquer and later Reconquista of the Peninsula in the middle ages
Well, except Basque, which, as you correctly pointed out, is an pre-indoeuropean language, so it had to already exist in some form way before the Islamic period
No prob, they're still extremely similar to this day
Sometimes is easier to understand Galicians than to understand Brazilians
But it all comes to being acquainted more to one or the other
[Amorim]
World largest producer of cork products
Household name here in Portugal, mostly unknown outside
If you have something, whatever, made from cork, there a 80% chance that it came from Portugal
From wine stoppers to spacecraft insulation,  Amorim makes it all
Yes because bus schedules are incompatible with the hours i need to be in university and after a certain hour the bus ceases to perform the route that i need
On a positive note i only drive until the metro station (still far, its in the next town, but at least i don't have to endure the nightmare that's entering Lisbon with a car also more environmental friendly)
Its shame because if the schedule at uni was the same has last year i could have only use the bus and metro to move
Other than getting to Lisbon i depend on car
It's pretty much impossible to move around without a car here where I live
I live in the outskirts of Porto, and here I live there's only 2 bus lines that service my small town with buses every half an hour, and it only goes to Porto, and only covers the main road in my town so you have to have a car, if not you can't even go to a supermarket
Well, yes
Everyday I go to work, if it's not misty or super cloudy, I get to see the Palace of Sintra and the castle of Lisbon from the bridge I cross
Also the ruins of Carmo, from the 18th century earthquake are very visible, because they're on a hill
There are also centuries hold restaurants, stores, etc
It's not very unusual
I have a childhood memory of always passing through a 18th century aqueduct when going to the beach, the aqueduto das águas livres, in Lisbon
Oh that and the fact that my city's local park used to be a royal palace, I think, some sort of solar
Plus in most major cities there is the historical castle, which many times has become some sort of museum like the castle of Gimarães, where the first king of Portugal was born, and can have something like a café.
But it's not like there are artifacts in my backyard, I live in a rather recent part of my city, and tbh I don't have a backyard
But yes, if you do at least a bit of travel across the country you'll find relics of the past, good thing covid hit the tourist business(if we ignore it is a major part of Portugal's revenue), I fear the violation of many city's scenery just to build buildings for touristic leasure, like hotels
My town of Mértola (in Southern Portugal) is pretty much the poster-town for this kind of thing, and archeology is kind of a big thing here
I didn't find anything digging in my backyard, but there's a real possibility that I would, if I did
You pretty much find something of historical value every time that you dig a hole here
Just last year, some Iron Age artifacts (mainly burial urns, but also jewelry, if I'm not mistaken) were unburied 50m or so from my door (there's a small video about it [here] but I can remember such things as a [6th century mausoleum being found beneath our main street while changing pipes] [roman statues being found while renovating an house] (there's also a Roman museum underneath the Town Hall, built around the ruins of a Roman house that were found there) or a skeleton being found in my high school during a routine pipe replacement (not as much of a surprise when you know that my school had an actual Roman burial ground smack in the middle of it, unburied and musealized)
And all the archeological findings started, fittingly enough for this thread, with the person who would become the founder of our Archeological Camp realizing that there were fragments of Islamic-era pottery amongst the rubble stored in some grounds near the castle
Those grounds would later prove to be on top of an entire Islamic neighbourhood, various roman ruins (including a cryptoportico and reasonably well preserved mosaics) and not one, but two early christian baptisteriums
So, yeah, some places (like my town) are really kind of crazy in that regard
Ah yes, the ancient *Via Subterranea*.
Almost nothing, really
I had thought about this and I find it very concerning
I don't know how it is for other countries, but in Portugal, more than 90% of adopted legislation comes from the EU
Yet, almost no-one votes for EU parliament
I think for most people the EU is where the "orders" come from and where "money comes and goes".  Not much else
It's very concerning for me that people are mildly aware that the EU has the "last word" in many important matters and yet they don't know that it's actually democratic and quite transparent, nor do they care
I think a extensive program to inform EU citizens and incentivise their participation in EU matters is as important, if not more, than the development of the institutions
We have a paragraph on our history books that mentions it after the second world war chapter so yeah
I don't know if this an age thing or a different teachers thing or something else
But when I finished secondary school in 2011
I had learned quite a lot about the EU in school
Mostly Geography and History classes  but also Law classes (year 12)
I remember learning about the European parliament and how the EU was structured and organised and different treaties (like Maastricht) and so on
At University, the majority of information was regarding Erasmus+ study and internship programme
I ended up doing an Erasmus+ Internship in the UK myself
I seem to remember that lots of the conference and seminars related to University research projects was also funded by EU projects
So I think I might be more informed than most on that front but I do agree with what you said about general public perception in Portugal
I'll be talking about the Porto area, I don't know if things down south differ that much
For buses you usually pay with cash and the subways you buy the ticket in the stations with either cash or card
Right now I have a card for which I pay 16 euros monthly, that allows me to go anywhere in the greater Porto area how many times I want
The card is valid for the subway and a few bus companies
The card is actually 40 euros/month (still not a lot) but it's cheaper for students that applied for a scholarship
I pay monthly cuz I go to school everyday, and I pay like 60-70€ cuz I live 50km from school (1h and 30 min), and like, I prefer paying monthly cuz if I paid everyday I would be paying per month around 285,2€
In Portugal I've heard "banana" and "whisky" mostly
Some photographers sometimes say sth like "look at the little bird
" when taking a photo
It's funny
I don't think there's a standard phrase that's widely used by everyone, some people I know say "batata frita" (french fry), for instance
Many people don't use any go-to phrase at all
Sometimes we just flat out say it as in english (cheese), sometimes we also say banana or something similar
My dad used to say “fromage” just for fun xd
In Portugal we have a similar one "olha o passarinho" = "look, the birdie"
Some people say “Olhó passarinho
”, but nowadays I guess its not that common
Some people simply say "sorri
" (smile
Do they say "cheese" in English, or do they say "fromage"?
Yeah, where I live “sorri
” is the most used one
Here's what I've had happening to me: a nice couple helped me find my hotel in English, and then asked me where I was from
I said Portugal
And then, they started to talk about when they visited Portugal and so on, all in Spanish
A tour guide was fallowing me and trying to sell me a tour
He was going like "Bon giorno
Italian
French
Spanish
Como estás?" At this point I was like "Hell no
". "Then what
Portuguese
Ronaldo, Ronaldo
" He was fallowing me in the streets of Vienna screaming Ronaldo
This is actually quite common
Many people seem to think that saying "Ronaldo" to a Portuguese is like saying "psss psss" to a cat
I relate with this statement on a spiritual level
" Ah
Portugal
South of Spain
Very nice
Happened to me in London
The Ronaldo crap happens all over the world but Turkey and Tunisia was the worst
Argh
The "Ronaldo
" when they discover you're Portuguese is so true it hurts
I had the "pssss psss" in USA
A security in the UN
I told him how could he
His boss should be his Portuguese reference
A long time ago, before Ronaldo in Tunisia they told me Madjer, eh, Madjer
Same here, "Elisabete II, Rainha de Inglaterra".
Wrong, he meant the Oktoberfest
Nice, but r/giraffesdontexist
Portugal is the #1 producer and exporter of bicycles in Europe
7 million bikes in 2019 :)
We have the oldest active navy in the world, founded in 1317
We sailed to India and China on small sized vessels through unchartered regions of the planet about 500 years ago, so we didn’t have to deal with them pesky middle eastern islamic empires when traveling on the road
Never heard of ;)
At least you are not alone
I sure loved Vienna when I was there, and I miss it a lot
Care to explain the "most drunk man ever"? Like highest level of alchool in blood before dying
Most beers/alchoolic beverage drank in a certain time
Holland and Denmark don't make their own bikes
You did
Probably overseas territories
Bring on the rice and pasta
We would cook rice
In Portugal, other than football and it's variants (futsal, beach football), only handball and roller hockey have a national impact
However, it's rare that they go violent outside the field
Here in Portugal there have been a couple of small isolated violent incidents related to basketball games and rink hockey (or roller hockey) games
But the thing is, those incidents are also mostly due to soccer rivalries, because here in Portugal the organization of sport entities is a bit different than it is in the United States for example, so while for example in the US you might have an American Football Team and a NBA team in the same town but they have nothing to do with each other on the organization level, here in Portugal the most common organization structure is that you will have a Sports Club in a town, and then that Sports Club has a soccer team, and a basketball team, and a rink hockey team, and so on, and all those teams are identified by the name of the club
So you can have two clubs that are soccer rivals and that rivalry carries over to all the other sports, and sometimes people will show up for games of those other sports even if they don´t care that much about them just because their club is playing
Call it soccer again and you will see me turn violent
Rugby is also quite popular, at least in Lisbon
I'm from the North and whilst I regularly watch rugby matches, there is only a few others that watch
Portugal, Spain, France and Italy would be in charge of the food and wouldn't let anyone else get near it
Especially the British
Portugal probably eating and sharing cooked sardines and bacalhau to everyone, sharing its porto and green wine, having a conversation (fun and friendly with a lot swear words) with the other romance countries and then having a nice chat with England about the good old times of kicking Spain and France
During a scientific discussion Portugal would try to demonstrate the many ways that Cork wood can be used and the benefits (we produce Cork wood wallets, motor bike helmets with Cork wood, Cork wood shoes etc
At the end Portugal would have drank more wine than any other country and would only be a little bit drunk (happy drunk)
we would arrive one hour late
We whould try and get something while no one is watching because there is another discussion
The Swiss are absolute mad lads, they eat dinner at 18
As it is supposed to be
At least we'll eat something more than Apéros
I Europe yes, but not at home
Oh, of course, there'd be huge discussions amongst ourselves, especially when trying to decide whose bottle of wine to open
Fair enough, they can join us
Between those 4 countries, there'd be enough shouting in kitchen as it is
Don't put juice in the oven
At what time do you have lunch
And what is considered to be a regular work schedule (like 9-18)
Mad lads
In Portugal, dinner is typically at 20 or 21
Looks like someone needs help
Sadly this time its not with the french so syke
Nah, we would never waste wine
We'd save it and give it to someone else in the next party
I learned that the portuguese were the first christians to reach Japan and to get kicked out of it, and nowadays in Nagasaki ( I think) they celebrate our short presence there
I also learned that the fried shrimp that you find in almost every japanese restaurant in europe was originally a portuguese recipe that was made with a vegetable
Interesante
Breaking Bad
Margem Sul and Alentejo would be the perfect spots
Also, House of Cards would be really cool, considering the amount of corruption our government has
Going more to the comedy side, a show like the Office but Portuguese would be incredible comedic material
ahah I like this, and might add a game of thrones like show about the age of discovery showing the sailors and their interaction with natives around the world
The Belgian government coalition deals are enough for a complete series with movies, spin-offs, prequels,  sequels, you name it
Drugs are legal here
(They're decriminalized)
Portuguese borders are the oldest in the world
(Last changed 20 years ago)
Portuguese police is incompetent and corrupt
(Brought whenever the Madeline McCann case is discussed, truth is it could have been handled better but it's far from being an inept force)
Pastel de Belém is not a Pastel de Nata (Simply wrong, just look and taste them)
Several
The most popular in some circles is that Portugal legalized all drugs, or that real drugs are easy to obtain (condiments are) and that is a proof of something and legalize all drugs and so on
Foreigners really have a difficult time grasping that depenalizing drug consumption was not meant to make it easier for consumers to consume and that everything else, including buying, selling and producing is ilegal and a crime
It probably ruins their agenda anyway
The no net neutrality in Portugal
Ffs
smaller, but Portugal really is not on the mediterranean and is not actually much of a mediterranean country
Food and weather maybe (but not quite
foreigners do not expect the wind or cold water)
You would think this would be trivial, but I just bet in 10 minutes of me posting this, somebody foreigner is going to post "but actually"....
Cute fact of the week
>Pastel de Belém is not a Pastel de Nata
Não queres dizer ao contrário
A minha ideia é que o pastel de Belém é um tipo de pastel de nata (específico de Belém)
“Only” 5k lol that’s still a ridiculous amount to pay
"But have you seen Portugal ISP's packages
The ones that were declared illegal by ANACOM
(Portuguese FCC)
I'm not finding a lot about a border change 20 years ago (maybe someone else can also clarify me on that)
But basically, we have a very old border with Spain (the treaty that officially established our borders was signed in 1297)
However, there have been a number of minor border changes between the two countries throughout the 7 following centuries
For example, Olivença/Olivenza was illegally anexed by Spain in 1801
Note that the border changes are all very minor
It's not entirely correct to stay it's the oldest non-changed border in the world, but it's not entirely dishonest either
Probably Macau being handed over back to China in 1999
I scared them off by telling them I awaited them but they could not resist, they are out now
I think they were trying to answer to [this] post by OP
Right
At some point one might consider dying, it should be cheaper
>Not for an American
Nah mate, no matter where you are if you have to pay 5k to get yourself healthy/fixed it’s a ridiculous amount
Even the fact that someone is charged with that value is ridiculous
But to able not to pay for the medical bills you have to go through applications to see if you’re in fact eligible and after that if you still don’t pay the bills it can eventually go to debt collection and affect your credit
That doesn’t seem that simple
Why are you advocating for it then
Because with that answer it doesn’t make any sense for to say “it’s simple if you can’t afford don’t pay it”
I do understand the cost of things thank you very much, and getting charged 5k is ridiculous
Everywhere else in the EU I can have a medical treatment and not pay those kind of figures
Not to mention OP did say something about the original bill being 100k and that is beyond ridiculous that’s just ludicrous
Care to elaborate then
Why is it that I can go to the hospital for all sorts of things and come back with a bill that’s not even close to 5k? Or why is it that I can call for an ambulance and not pay 1k for it
Are we all wrong about the cost of things and only the all mighty USA is right
Or are you so deeply misinformed that you actually believe the crap you say
Yes you can do that with insurance
Without insurance the medical bills are so high people actually get a big debt, that requires them to fill up forms after forms just to be eligible not to pay
And as I’ve said if it turns out that they’re not eligible to pay, the bills eventually go into debt collection
Well not every injury happens when people are at work right
So that’s a special case, an exception if you may
I’ve been to the hospital a few times unfortunately, due to sports injuries and I never payed even close to 400€, so even that it’s a big amount to pay
Here if I go into the hospital let’s say with an appendicitis I will pay 80€ max
>Got an EKG and some other tests and it was 400$ total
Now am I imagining things or did your actually write this
You were charged with it, if you’re insured you probably won’t pay but everyone else that isn’t will eventually have to
Is that so hard to understand
Either you really are misinformed or all of [these] are wrong
There’s even a [study] on medical bills and how they affect people, if you don’t have the patience to read you can always read [this] that says that someone who is uninsured and has medical bills doubles his chances of filing for bankruptcy over the next four years
Or even [this] describing in detail how to figure out how to pay for said medical bills
>How are you this confused
Really
Well let’s see because up until now I have provided you with articles, studies and general knowledge about the subject while you failed to provide a single argument good enough to prove me wrong
Even a fellow American citizen u/100dylan99 (sorry to bring you into this mate) has confirmed about his family going bankrupt over medical bills
Yet all you have to answer is “no”, “you’re wrong” and “you don’t understand the cost of things” while failing to provide something that would confirm it
It’s like taking to a broken record that has nothing else to say except all of those things

~~EDIT: Portugal btw, I haven't set up my flag yet
Hmm
maybe he was the most famous person but the best story imo is the myth Tomás Taveira
When I was little my siblings loved Eminem and my favorite song of his was "Stan". I'm not really I to hip-hop so I did hear the song for a long time, and when I did I was shocked with what be said
Also [Shaggy - It wasn't me]
It’s not a tradition but it exists
I’ve been to summer camps when I was younger
My lil cousin is in one now
I don't believe so
At least I've never been sent to one
Seems like an American thing
Usually every 6 months to a year, depends on the teeth and the teeth doctor, I go in once a year, my brother twice, that is recommended but last year I didn't go and this year I might go
In Portugal oral health, in general, is not covered by national health system
And not everyone have a private dental health plan
I visit the dentist 2 times a year, conscious that this type of profilatic care, is much more cheap that the potencial treatments if I neglect my oral health
That is not very comom, most people go to the dentist once a year, or only if they have problems
Mostly for budget reasons
I go very rarely, I've gone to the dentist for 5 years, now I go from year to year, but I'm careful
I brush my teeth every day and floss, mouthwash, etc
I was surprised that most of our most famous battles against Castille aren't taught in Spain, like the battle of Aljubarrota
Also the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance, through the Treaty of Windsor, it's ramifications and the fact that it's still active
This one I'm not sure if it is taught outside Portugal and, possibly, the UK
What about France's history
Did you focus more on them
Abolished for political crimes: 1852
Abolished for civil crimes, except treason during wars: 1867
Abolished for all crimes: 1911
Allowed again for treason during wars against another country if committed in the theater of war: 1917
Abolished for all crimes again: 1976
Capital punishment in Portugal was first abolished in 1867 for civil crimes
Portugal was the first country in the world to begin the process to abolish death penalty
It was carried out in stages: for political crimes in 1852, for all crimes (except military) in 1867, and for all crimes in 1911
However, in 1916, death penalty was reinstated only for military crimes committed in the theatre of war against another country
This was abolished again in 1976
Despite military death penalty being legal from 1911 to 1976 for military crimes, only one soldier was executed (in 1917), although the reason for it is unknown
The last civil execution in Portugal took place in Lagos in 1846
In Portugal the death penalty was abolished in 1867 for non military crimes except treason, following the Grand Duchy of Toscana
There was a movement that thought that the abolishing the death penalty would give a great civilizational advantage to the Kingdom
I'm with them
It was a long time ago, it is not really in our consciousness any more
About a reversal being talked, just the most populist right wing politician who tries every hot topic they (his puppet string pullers) can think of, to see what sticks
It has no pull, it is very ludicrous to even think of it, of justice officials duly picking up somebody and taking them somewhere to be officially killed by somebody else
And yeah, somebody gets paid to kill somebody officially
It is unimaginable
I remember, after the Portuguese revolution, in 1975 the execution of Garmendia and Otaegui
I was 9 years old and was completely horrified
In Portugal as soon as they try to socialize and be polite to the natives they will be well treated, there is always some exceptions sometimes but large majority of portuguese people are tolerant to foreigners, no matter where they came from
The ones that try to impose their own traditions,  look to make friendship just with people from the same country or religion or get esely offended will not have the same luck
Don't tell me that you're still mad about the siege of Vienna
Well I didn't notice that much racism and I know a lot of people from Angola or Guinea, at least in the North of Portugal, maybe in places where African community's are bigger things are different but like I said before people here don't deal that well when people try to integrate themselves just with people with the same origin, race or religion
I just can tell you about the places I know better, in my city the black people, at least the ones I know seem well integrated in society, or course there is always some idiots with racist thoughts but is bit rare and usually people are against these thoughts
I didn't know that
I assumed it was the Spanish who did that
Since your Austria and Spain were best friends in those centuries
Our holidays always stay on their dates, regardless
*looks at where I am right now*
No :(
1st May is a day off but this year it was on saturday :/
Yeah and we just had two holidays fall on two weekends in a row
*Sad bacalhau noises* :'(
what you mean 1st May is not a day off
What kind of country is that
1st May is a day off everywhere in the civilized world that respects labour rights
Shit
I shower every single day unless I'm sick or if it's a really cold winter weekend where I don't need to go outside
I usually shower around 5-6 times a week
Taking 3 showers a day is understandable in hot and humid climates but in here in Europe it just sounds like a waste of water to me
Shower everyday most of the year
In summer, more often and I have had 3 showers a day days - I feel a bit guilty about water usage and they are much short showers, almost no soap
But if it it's really hot and muggy and I got to change clothes, just a 2/3 minute shower and maybe more than once a day
In winter it is totally different
In Portugal we shower once a day
I have heard that brazilians say we don't shower, is that true
In Brazil people shower more frequently because of the climate I think
It's that hot and humid weather, which makes you sweat more
We sometimes have that in Portugal during Autumn and Spring
In my region, we call it "Tempo Esquisito".
I do it too, my partner found it so weird that they gave me a pizza cutter for my b-day as a joke
However, I have asked an Italian friend and he said he does it sometimes as well
You can relax knowing that some Italians do it too
Different empire
The sick leaves were kinda permanent, if you get the gist
There are many jokes regarding Alentejanos (people from Alentejo) as lazy people
People also joke about the Azorean (São Miguel island) accent
As to look down, people from Lisbon are regarded as cold/unfriendly (schoking to tourists) by people from other regions
Some people will say Lisbons people feel morally superior to others
The elitism and crentalism of the city kinda makes it happen
Definitely Alentejo
Alenjanos (Alentejo's people) have the stereotype of being really lazy and sleeping all day in the shade  because Alentejo is really hot in the summer
They also have a specific accent
The state of Acre, in Brazil: it doesn't exist
If it does, all you'll find there are dinosaurs and UFOs
In Portugal, people will joke about the region of Alentejo, saying it's a rural wasteland with only ond people and heat
Here in São Miguel we also joke with our accent, specially with people from the town of Rabo de Peixe because they have a very strong accent, even for island standards
"Portugal é Lisboa e o resto é paisagem" já dizia o Eça
This is my favourite sentence about portugal because it is so true
I don't believe that every person in lisbon is rude or whatever but the superiority they feel like they have above the rest of the country is infuriating sometimes
Lisbon is to Portugal as America is to the world ahahah
(((Would still love to live in Lisbon though
Amazing city
)))
Lisbon (2M+) > Oporto (1M+) > Braga (~200k)
Lisbon is the big capital, with the self centered stereotype, rent prices that cost an arm and a leg, and lots of immigrants, specially from Portuguese speaking African countries
It's laid on the river Tagus estuary
Oporto is the North Portugal city of reference, with a lot of regional pride
Its streets are a bit of more grey tone compared with Lisbon, and it's rainier and foggier
It sits where river Douro meets the Atlantic ocean
Braga is the regional capital of Minho, close to Oporto, being significantly smaller than the big 2 Portuguese cities
It has stereotype of being very religious, very rainy (the last one is actually true)
It has a significant population of Brazilians
It doesn't sit close to any significant body of water, as the Este is nothing more than a creek
it's kind of dumb to compare city sizes by using municipal limits
Oporto safely beats Paris and Toronto
but Toronto might be the biggest Azorean city
I'm Portugal vaccines aren't exactly mandatory, but schools won't allow kids to enroll if they don't have their vaccinations checked up
I think the same applies to workplaces
For the ones that have translation yes, like Queen Elizabeth II = Isabel II, however we don’t change the names of Harry or William
I have to say, Kosovo
In Portugal, when there's a really bad situation/happening, people have this saying "It's worse than Kosovo
" or "Looks like Kosovo
" (Idk if anyone says this in other countries in Europe, never heard it)
After visiting Kosovo, I can say that Kosovo is actually pretty nice, and definitely not the worst of the Balkans
My cousin is spending her holidays there right as we speak, says she loves the architecture
Oh beer, how I miss the Netherlands
While working there we had once a month bitterballen and cocktails and every Friday they had Heineken on the fridge of every floor for people to have after lunch
Don’t know if it is normal as it was an IT company and sometimes there is some different cultures between it companies even
Oh I’m not saying this because of the alcohol part itself the point was to be able to pause and grab something and have a conversation with colleagues that normally we would not stop to chat in the busy normal days
From my work experience most companies would do in non-work days events for this and that is something I’m totally against so I miss that other way
P.S. never seen people drunk even with this alcohol available at working hours
Edit: to add the p.s.
Xutos & Pontapés - Contentores -
It's probably the most successful rock band in Portugal and this song it's one of the most popular
It's about drugs and overcoming dependency, but done in a non so evident way
Don't know if you're into doom metal but [Sinistro] is a great portuguese band and it has the twist of having a sweet female voice in this particular song
Here are some recommendations of some rock and metal bands from my country:
Moonspell;
Xutos e Pontapés;
GNR;
(maybe)Capitão Fausto (their hits are leaned more towards pop but they made some rock songs too)
You should also check out Spotify's official playlist of portuguese rock (called "Rock Português)
This song  "Homem do Leme" by Xutos & Pontapés is very beautiful and the opening instrumental sounds like a Portuguese guitar
A Portuguese guitar sounds like this
[A minha casinha] by Xutos & Pontapés
Portugal has some heavy metal culture, mostly on the black metal scene
[Moonspell - Todos os Santos] \- a song about the 1755 earthquake, I mean all this album "1755" is about the earthquake
[Sinistro - Partida]  \- recent doom metal project signed to season of mist, it is really powerfull and groovy
[Bizarra Locomotiva - Mortuário] \- extreme industrial metal band with some really groovy songs, this is their live performance of "Mortuário"
My opinion on some of the worst ones:
**António de Oliveira Salazar** ^((obvs)^)
A fascist dictator that ruled my country with an Iron Fist, limitating freedom of expression and sending thousands upon thousands of young men to Africa to fight in the Colonial War
*Reason of Insanity:* Being obssessed with the overseas territorries and doing ANYTHING to keep them, regardless of the number of Portuguese lives lost
**D. João V**
An absolute monarch who thought he was Louis XIV
Spent almost all the gold from Brazil in parties, wigs and palaces
*Reason of Insanity:* Being crazy and obssessed with imitating The Sun-King and occasionally fucking nuns
How is Salvini so influential
I'm Portuguese, and I don't even know who your PM is
"Casa Pia" case in Portugal
A child sexual abuse scandal that involved many famous people
The sentence came in 2010 and resulted in some arrests of prominent figures
But this story is so complicated and has so many holes that some people still have doubts about whether some people were really involved in it
It is said that the kids were getting paid to accuse specific people in order to end some careers
The abuses were real, but some of the names involved were innocent (some people belive it, others don't)
There's that corruption case involving our ex Prime Minister, José Sócrates
There's the Casa Pia case that was particularly awful
Some men in power abused kids that were in the care of the Casa Pia de Lisboa
There's some corruption situations regarding futebol
There's a taxes corruption case after the Pedrogão wild fires
That deserves a novel
What a story
Dangerous people, I remember the Red Army
In Portugal we had a similar case many years ago, the Revolutionary Brigades that bombed and killed several people
It's an unusual situation in Portugal, big time Portuguese criminals are mostly white collar
Any idea of where someone can watch it with english subtitles
What does being able to mean
A certain amount of income
Debts covered
Above poverty line
3 countries with the biggest stick up their asses in Europe
Always condescending towards the rest of the EU
Not really, we do however say it “differently” depending on the gender
So if you’re a woman you say Obrigada and if you’re a man you say Obrigado
Just to add an explanation on why it happens, "obrigado" (masculine) or "obrigada" (feminine) literally translates into English as "obliged", as in "I'm obliged to you". So, it's a past participle, and in Portuguese, past participles work the same away as adjectives, which vary in gender (meaning, word suffixes differ depending on the gender of the person or object it's referring to)
"Obrigados" does exist
You don't hear it that often but I've heard it several times
Living in Portugal for half a decade and still don't know if I am saying it wrong or not
Thanks for the input
I actually thought about that when commenting but decided not to add it just because our most used word for thank you is obrigado(a), but you’re absolutely correct
Nah, it’s literally “thank you”
It can be both
It can mean obligated or thank you
We have a few words like that, same writing, same pronunciation and different meaning
Yes
I don't know why it became the most common way to thank people in Portuguese, but the way we say "thank you" is pretty much saying we're in debt of that person (sort of "I am *obliged* to repay this favor to you")
The literal translation of "thank you" in Portuguese would be "agradeço-te", which while perfectly correct, would sound "off", as it's just not common to use
I think you meant to answer another Redditor as I didn’t partake in that discussion
obrigada
No, I really meant to reply to you, when you said "not really" :)
Oh sorry, I’m on mobile and it became a little difficult to keep up with the comment thread
I get it now and your absolutely right I stand corrected
I wasn't aware
Fernando Pessoa, Saramago, Camões, Sophia de Mello Breyner and some other portuguese writers
I can only think of Anne Frank's Diary as a book that was not written by a Portuguese
In high-school if you choose literature you probably read more books from other countries but I don't really know
I don't remember reading Sophia, nor Anne Frank
I read "Os Maias", Eça de Queirós.
"Sermão de Sto
António aos Peixes".
"Os Lusíadas", Luís de Camões
That Saramago book about the Mafra monestary, I don't remember the title, because I hated it
"O livro verde de Cesário Verde"
"Felizmente há Luar", don't remember the author
A whole bunch of stuff from Fernando Pessoa and his multiple personalities, except for the most awesome one -- Livro do Desassossego (Book of Disquiet)
I don't think we ever talked about books not written in Portuguese
1) Cash
2) Ibuprofen
3) Gun
4) Weed
5) Motorcycle
6) Pastéis de nata
7) Cozido
8) Jewllery
9) Clothes
10) Dog
Just for living, since I don't exactly bring a lot of stuff with me when travelling
Smartphone
Nintendo Switch
Nintendo 3DS
GameCube
Headphones
Wii
SEGA Saturn
Csn only think of 7
Can't think of any
Bunker
I don't think any have made into the portuguese language
Unless you mean Poltergeist or Zeitgeist, but I don't remember the last time I've used such words in my life
Not exactly commonly used words
The only one I can think of is chiça, which is of celtic origin and shares a common cognate with the german word Scheiß
Although, it's not exactly a germanism strictly speaking, it does have german roots
Bunker
How often do you use such word on a daily basis
I never use it
That's not a germanism
That's the name of the pastry: Berlin Ball
That'd be akin to saying that French fries is a franconism
Sometimes I do, but not on a daily basis I guess
That
Is exactly my point
The pastry is called [*bolas de berlim*] literally Berlin balls, because they are pretty much [berliners] (but much better =)) . Its not a germanism
Rare ish but perfectly accepted provided it looks minimally clean and doesn't smell
Years of growing in a military base have conditioned me to not like long hair and facial hair
I had long hair and ponytail up until university
It would be frowned upon while looking for a job/ working so I cut it and never grew it back since
My first manager used to comment frequently if I didn't shave for one day or even didn't bring a belt (I was a consultant)
People in Portugal can still be quite conservative and shallow
In portuguese it's "Louva-a-deus", meaning "worship god" or "worshiper of god"
louva-a-deus, it kinda translates to
god praiser
That's exactly the same in Portuguese, wth
Louva-a-Deus
In Portuguese we call it louva-a-deus so not in all Romance languages
I mean the theme is similar but it's not exactly the same
Similar here
We call it "louva-a-deus" which means literally "praises-god".
Always one need to be the odd one out
Romania it's usually the one, but in this case they follow the norm so we were compelled to breach it
The gipsy king arent spanish
We speak Spanish or we are a province of Spain
That its spain, not portugal, and our spanish accent is realy good
Also brazil
Most people think portuguese comes from brazil, and cant distinguish Portugal and Brazil
#overall, learn basic geography
SpAiN 2
Mexico is also stereotyped in a similar way and they kinda like it
Why donyt you like it
France is actually one of the countries with the best military record, isn't it
Cheese eating surrender monkey*
Portuguese people that live in Porto call moors to the people living in Lisbon
I meant what offends us, not the reality
Not sure if cooler means happy drunk people or military :D
C'est pas possible
>Portuguese people that live in Porto call moors to the people living in areas south from Porto, but with a special hatred for Lisbon
Fix it
Øslo is from Bulgaria though
Half truth then
Just to deep into detail, do you mean south of Porto city or south of the metropolitan area
Just don't make it 8 years
>south of the metropolitan area
No idea
Then there is that thing abroad where they call "castles" (schloss, chateau) to things which to me clearly aren't
Castles in every town churches in every corner looks like
I've lost count
Uh thats a palace not a castle

Damn I wanna move to Sweden
That would be Gouveia, a city in Portugal
These are also valid:

Ofcourse, went to an edm festival here in portugal, and the people in the bus all started to sing the national hymn and and other portuguese shit, the foreigns were all cringing because they didnt understand shit, no one was even drunk, except for one guy who was screaming "E OS ESPANHOIS, VAO PO CARALHO" (fuck the spanish) by himself
Our drunks sing on the bus, on the street, the park, water fountains, at home at 4 in morning waking everyone in the building
That is glorious
Brazilian Portuguese seems to have more slightly different grammar and they also use a lot of incomprehensible slang and word things in a really strange way that Portuguese people don't. So it can happen, yes
Brazilian Portuguese is very easy to understand despite the pronounciation being quite different
Tbh it's harder to understand some versions that exist here in Portugal like the Azores and Madeira accents
Yes
Grammar differences and accents
Well nah, but of course there are 1 or 2 words that we dont get
While in there, there are some very thick accents that are barely comprehensible
I think it depends a lot on the specific Brazilian accent
If it's one of the more known ones you see in Brazilian soap operas and other media, it's easy to understand
If it's from up north or somewhere else where the accents get weird (from our perspective), then it can sometimes to very hard to follow
Also, it depends a lot on the context
Watching a [random internet video] will make it more difficult to understand than if I was having a conversation with someone I know about the weather, for example
You definitely havent met a Northern Portuguese
That's nothing
Northern Portugal is infamous for their profanity, some people can't say a phrase without one
You often see men greet each other by calling each other "meu caralho" (my dick) in an affectinate way
I'm from Northern Portugal btw
No idea
I'm not knowledgeable of the variety of Brazilian accents nor do I consume any Brazilian media
Which is a bit ironic considering we're more religious up here
Reaching India by sea
Like, by far
It was the culmination of 73 years of investment and blood poured into it, in attempts to legitimising Portugal as a country and a major global power for a good while
Especially when contrapuncted with Spain trying the same and failing (upwards, since they got to America, but still)
Conquering Ceuta, since it was the first step in the whole thing, discovering Brazil, or passing the various African capes and Gulfs (particularly the Torments cape) all definitely contribute to the image of the sailors and explorers that went against nature/monster/gods depending on the narrator, but it was all in hopes of reaching India to begin with
You can see it in our architecture, our music, our anthem, our national symbols, our linguistic expressions, our cuisine and everything else
It's like having won the biggest competition at the time whilst being the biggest underdogs
Idk about the most defining, another pt guy already posted a much more wholesone post full of positive things, but
There is still some resentment about one "portuguese" king (he was spanish) fucking up our whole armada trying to attack England (our oldest allie)
So, basically, the spanish fucked up our beautiful fleet, like, 300 or 400 years ago, and it was only downhill from there
Of course there is also the 16 year old king before that, that decided to kill himself without having childern in northern Africa
A good old prick that should return any day now in the fog
any day now
so that's how we got to have the same king as spain iirc
Anyways, fun fact, Brazil never became independent from Portugal
Our king just moved there in the napoleonic invasions and the country became independent from Brazil
We kept the other colonies, though
So all the other former colonies kind of became independent from Brazil, in a way, which for a short time had the capital of Portugal
I d say there are plenty
Probably the moment d Sebastião died which lead an iberian union and eventually to the fall of the portuguese empire
Also definitely the Implementation of the Republic and D. João Mestre de Avis being named king after we finally ended Spain's domain over us
Edit: Unfortunately, in terms of consequences, D. Sebastião's disappearance was what caused many of the events in the following centuries, so in a sense it also fits this question
In terms of national identity I think it's also worth mentioning the [Portuguese Restoration War] a 28 year long war that ended the Iberian Union and reinforced the idea of us being separate from the rest of the Iberian Kingdoms .
> More importantly, after 1668, Portugal, determined to differentiate itself from Spain, turned to Western Europe, particularly France and England, for new ideas and skills
This was part of a gradual "de-Iberianization", as Portugal consolidated its cultural and political independence from Spain
Portuguese nationalism, aroused by success on the battlefield, produced hostile reactions to Spain and to Spanish things and persons
We had so many wars against Spain that I don't think any one of them can be said to be the "defining one". Maybe Aljubarrota is the most famous, and 1762 was the definitive one
It certainly contributes to the national identity a ton, though
I hate oysters
In Portugal they're eaten alive with lemon juice
The problem for me is  not that they're alive, it is the taste
My family loves oyster but I can't stand them
I hate [Feijoada] but everyone here loves it
I'd rather eat rabbit kidneys, pig's ear or snails
At least they taste good
"Bacalhau á Brás"
It's basically fish and chips, but much worse
I dislike many popular portuguese foods
Probably the one I hate the most is the *Cozido à Portuguesa*, which basically a huge pot with all kinds of weird cuts of pork and beef, along with vegetables I also don't like
There's also *Caldo Verde*, which is a soup with these fine leaf strips that cling to the back of your throat when swallowing and it's frankly disgusting
Shellfish, especially prawns/shrimp are pretty popular here, and it's not that I hate it but I tend to find it a bit meh most of the time
Portuguese people are pretty keen on fruit in my experience, which isn't something I usually eat out of my own initiative, other than the occasional apple or pear
And there's lots of fruits I can't stand, including some popular ones like peach and pineapple
And Portuguese people also tend to love freshly squeezed orange juice, which I'm also not fond of
And there's also presunto (cured ham), which to me often tastes a bit too fatty and salty and has a kind of off-putting consistency, it's often greasy and really hard to chew, and then you sometimes swallow some of it which you think you chewed properly but it's still connected to a bit that's still in your mouth and now you've got a kind of unchewed bit in your mouth and a bit in your throat connected by a string and trying to chew and swallow triggers a gag reflex and it's also really hard to bring the other bit back up and it's 30 seconds of absolute torture, especially if there isn't a glass of water at hand
I do like it in thin slices with bread and/or cheese, especially if it's not too fatty
Edit: Caldo verde, aka "Portuguese kale soup". I'm pretty fond of soup in general, but I don't really like caldo verde
Whereas the opposite is actually kind of common: people who don't normally eat soup but get excited about caldo verde
We eat live stuff
Are oysters that popular in Portugal
I don't think I've ever even seen anyone eat oysters
I won't judge you because I don't like codfish of any kind
Feijoada is not my favorite but I don't hate it, what I really don't go along with is cozido à portuguesa and (sorry everyone) arroz doce I can't I just can't.
I'd like to contribute with Bifana
Not that I "hate" it, but foreigners and tourist always go crazy for this thing that's essentially bachelor's food
It's just some shit you eat when you need something fast and don't want to bother
That, sir, broke my heart
Yes
OYSTERS
I don't, but a lot of people do
It seems like it is more common in the Algarve
That you be considered almost a crime in Portugal LOL
The most cooking acceptable is vaporizing, and even already raises some eyebrows hahah
Never seen anyone eat oysters (ostras)
Are you sure you are Portuguese
In tha Algarve you see people eating them everywhere
In Lisbon it is not so common, but you can see it too
I don't understand how someone doesn't like codfish, my brother and sister both hate it but I love it no matter the recipe I just don't get it it's so good
Guys can we revoke this guy nationality
I also dislike Arroz Doce
I learned that Cozido à Portuguesa really depends on the cook
I both loved and hated it at times
Aletria I can stand
Arroz doce makes me want to throw up in my mouth
That is because you don't know about Silas in Benfica do Ribatejo
I don't know why don't expand their business
Best bifanas I know
Bifanas with a cold beer and a football game is all I need on a lazy summer evening
I mean it's happened to me a few times, I'm not sure if this happens to other people or if I'm just shite at chewing
The thought of it makes me really wary of eating presunto
I suppose kind of like those people who've had a fishbone incident as children and are really picky with fish
I'm from Porto, maybe it's more popular in some regions than others
it tastes like piss, only good cod is bacalhau à brás
Yeah I'm from Porto too and can confirm that oysters aren't popular here
Not so common, but you still see that today: people, mostly man, spitting in the floor
I think that's a thing everywhere
I can't remember a Christmas where I haven't watched both of them
That and the Monte Carlo circus, it's a staple of Christmas
I would say it is
They prefer triangles, sometimes – in very special occasions – squares
They kind of slightly touch but not full on kiss
Since both people are doing it at the same time on different angles your lips mostly just sort of graze the cheek
Hahah that happen to me when I moved to London to study, everytime someone introduced me i would lean for a kiss and then remember they don't kiss they give handshakes a see the face of confusion from the other person
r/breadbros
Street
Not sure, but I would say primarily old school adults in here
That’s another level
Well, you can always use paper tissues for that if needed
Edit: I misunderstood the beginning of your comment
Not as prevalent as McDonald's or Burger King, but they exist in Portugal
Generally you can find them in the food courts at malls, but a KFC on its own is quite rare I think
You can find separate McDonald's buildings with drive-thrus in cities, sometimes Burger King as well, but not really KFC or any other fast food chains
It's actually been quite a while since I've been to one
I like fried battered chicken, but not when it has bones or is greasy, so whenever I used to go to KFC I'd get a type of chicken steak that was really good, but then they took it out the menu
The chicken popcorn was also delicious, but I don't think they do that anymore over here
Not very
I mean it exists, like dunno pizza hut
Mcdonalds and burger king and some local chains are far more usual
Checking their site they might have 33 "restaurants" on the whole country
I checked and there are 179 McDonalds
We eat a lot of chicken, but that is awfully industrial looking
We probably got 30000 churrascarias selling frango de churrasco, though
19 outlets in June 2017 according to Wikipedia but you can find 30+ on their website
They been expanding well this last couple of years it seems
Edit: Vs 176 McDonald's and 101* Burger Kings (2019*)
I think that after hitting 18 you should be able to cook at least some meals (unless you have a disability or condition that prevents you to do so)
I didn't really cook much before going to university, and even then I made some very poor decisions regarding my meals during my first year
But once I moved into a house with friends I started to learn more as we all taught each other and shared tips
My friends and I have a lot of lunches and dinners at each other's' houses and so we all cook a lot
I mean, how else are you gonna feed yourself if you live alone
Maybe if you're a really young adult, as in 18-19, people won't think less of you if can't cook, but if you're 30
They probably will think that's odd
Really
Interesting
It's not part of the curriculum here
At least it wasn't when I was a kid
No idea of that has changed ever since but education in Portugal always seemed to fail when it came to teach practical stuff that could be useful to you on a daily basis
Yeah the kitchen used to be our main hub
Miss the talks we used to have there
This is a quite depressing thread to read as a Portuguese man
Damnit, we might as well be an island in the middle of the Atlantic
None
The question doesn't make much sense tbh
We're basically a continental island
We're by ourselves :(
Why
I enjoy being alone
Great that you mentioned your (world's) oldest alliance m8
Omg I'm gonna tear up
Portugal
It's quite different
Maybe not so much from Faro or Porto area
But in relation to the interior, it's really different
People from the interior and the Islands live simpler lives, many of them don't even own a computer or know much about the Internet
Not that they are poor, they just don't give much importance to that
Life in those places is very self centered
Kind of like those American small towns from the movies and series
The majority of people in Portugal live by the sea, especially in Lisbon or Porto
In Lisbon is 1/3 of the whole population
In the interior and islands people usually work in the primary sector or simple businesses
I honestly envy the people who live outside of Lisbon and the other big cities
I don’t know about the Azores but Madeira has about the same offer of commodities that Lisbon offers and has way nicer weather than anywhere in mainland Portugal
And people in Madeira don’t live a “simpler life” as you said, it’s kind of the same life as people from Lisbon but on a smaller scale
Lisbon has 1 million out of 11 hardly one third
People in the interior have less access to things, less stores so less competitive prices and are poorer on average because there's a lot of industry but they pay you minimum wage and often force you to work extra hours
Also s big part of the interior doesn't have água canalizada
Let alone gas, and kind of still live in last century
I grew up half there and half in London and a bit in Braga, boy where the cities really different to the interior it's shocking seeing how little access to things people have
>Lisbon has 1 million out of 11 hardly one third
Wrong
Lisbon metropolitan area has [nearly 3 million] And the population of Portugal is closer to 10 million than 11 million, more concretely [10 117 809]
And maybe that's your experience, and that's OK
But I own a house in a village in the district of Évora and it's nothing like that
Not saying that doesn't happen
edit: maybe that happened back when you lived there
In my village the government even pays subsidies for couples who go to live there and have a child
Many parts of the interior are now much better because there are policies in place to incentivise people to go live there
The problem has to do with job opportunities, as you pointed out
That's why I'm stuck in Lisbon
But it seems you have spoken about industries, so you are likely speaking about the North region, while I was thinking about Center and South, which is more focused on primary sector
I'm in Italy now and even though in the north people mainly work in industry they have money and are paid good salaries normally
In Portugal up north specially Felgueiras you'll have bosses with Porsche/Mercedez/jaguar and paying minimum wage and coercing workers into unpaid overtime
It's really sad and helps explain the inequality that subsists up north in those areas
I was thinking of city
You're right the metropolitan area is huge
North and South are quiet different, the north is statistically poorer than the South far poorer so that might skew my views, but the interior North and center is definitely poor
Yes and I grew up in "Celorico de basto"which is consistently the poorest area of the country every year
It's weird how such a small country is so different North/centre/south (and islands too)
We have something called Lotaria de Natal which i guess is similar but to be honest i have no idea how popular it is but it's definitely not an every family tradition like in Spain
I find it very funny how they sing the numbers
You guys are all rich af holy shit
Probably the most well known is Franklim Lobo, considered a “drug baron” (ie drug lord) and the biggest Portuguese dealer ever by our authorities
AFAIK he run drug trade not only in here, but also in Brazil, Spain and Morocco – with the help of someone from inside the police, who bragged of catching him twice
Edit: couldn’t found relevant or in-depth articles in English, but here’s [one] that will help
There's lots of drugs apprehension and, small and big time smugglers caught
I can't think of any one in particular
There's that humongous Atlantic coast with pleasant seas, and that great tradition of smuggling and off the books trading
Things kind of calmed down after the 90s. We used to have Europe’s largest heroin market smack bang in the middle of Lisbon
1% of the population was hooked on the drug at one point
Then decriminalisation happened etc
and you know the story
Now I think the most high profile kingpin is Benfica’s current president
Everybody knows he’s involved and a significant amount of cocaine mysteriously appeared in his car at one point but he’s untouchable atm
People all over Europe claim they possess the biggest entry point of drugs into Europe (Spain, France, Italy all have people claiming it) and this is also done with Portugal, but I’m not aware of any more famous or significant drug dealers
Maybe they’re good at what they do
Didn't know that
Most arrests that we know of don't have names that we can recognize
I mean, this time they caught some guys, that time they caught, those other guys
Right, it seems that most of them are minor characters and don’t have exactly an interesting story behind them – like this one
Or at least, they don’t have enough appeal to the press
That might explain, partially, what you are pointing out
I honestly can't see any part seceding, I think our country has been notoriously absent that type of drama (compared to some others that is)
The most likely to secede would be the autonomous regions, the Madeira and Azores archipelagos
Portugal doesn't have any seceding movements
There was a small one during the 70s in Madeira, but nothing too big
I would say the islands are the most probable
The Algarve, historically, would also be a good candidate
Sometimes there's a northerner or two that like to boast about being so different from the rest of the country, but it's just talk
The most likely would be the Algarve because it’s often forgotten by the government and it’s a region that could sustain it self, althought, it’s pretty unlikely
There’s a general sense of pride of being Portuguese so I don’t think it would ever happen
Fun fact: When our commies reinstalled democracy, Madeira had a secession movement, not a strong one
It only lasted a few months as there was another revolution that was more right wing
There were Azorean and Madeiran independence movements (I think some were straight up paramilitaries) after the 25th of April, but they were more politically motivated and mostly died when the islands were given autonomy
Northern Portuguese people tend to go chest-bumping about their identity a lot
Still far from seceding but still
Galicians have made some protests in Lisbon, as if trying to incite the Portuguese government to do something, not sure what
But I think Luso- reintegrationism is more about preserving culture, language and national identity than it is about seceding, no
The Azores had a secession movement too
I did not know about that
Yeah
I know quite a few northerns that would be perfectly happy with joining Galicia and leaving the south
I think more often stray animals have problems with people than the other way around
Yes there has been a few cases of people getting mauled by dogs lately
I think there is actually a lack of dogs in the Netherlands
Many portuguese stray dogs are sent to the netherlands to be adopted
I assume from other countries too
You should speak to the pack of stray dogs that roamed around my university campus around 2000
On a more serious note
It used to be worst in terms of dogs, but nowadays is more or less controlled
Can't say the same for cats which are everywhere, as they don't pose such a high risk for public safety
Let me guess: Universidade Nova FCT
Por acaso não. Pólo 2 Coimbra
Blue is the standard here
Black is also normal, but less common
Well, around here, whatever you do, don't use red ink
Not on paper, not on e-mails
It's rude
The myth is that when you use red ink you are telling the recipient of your text to f* off
Only people allowed to use red ink are teachers, for grading papers, and that's it
Blue or black
I'm a teacher
I've observed that,  while my kids are younger, they prefer blue, but as they grow older some prefer black
I usually use a black pen to wite and a pink pen to grade the work of the younger ones
As they grow older I use a red grading pen
its the opposite here
Blue ink on everything "important" or official
And red is an insult to the reader, supposedly
Definitely
Fun fact my teacher suggested that we should all use black ink back in highschool (because of photocopying) and now I use black for any oficial papers
The thing about red ink is silly, in my opinion
I grade my students work with pink or red pens
I don't know what's insulting about that
Isn't it what grades all are about
Teachers get a free pass for writing in red
I wish my teachers used pink to grade my papers
So cute
Also, I do think it's a myth, but just in case, I avoid writing in red
I think that the insult is the presumption that you'd outrank them
Teachers outrank students, so it's appropriate
I think it's just an urban meme, to try and force people to write in colours that are actually readable
It's a myth
Teachers grade the students work in a different colour because the student and the parents need to see where the mistakes are
I use pink or read but other teachers use green, or other colours
Yeah that's always been my interpretation of it
It's like you're presenting yourself as an authority figure
But only imagine if the person on the other side believes in the myth
That's my "just in case"....
I'd explain why I use my red pen
If the belief was too deep I'd use another colour
Deep beliefs are out of my job description
Edited a typo
I remember both back when I was a kid, though it was more common for the children to outnumber the adults
My cousins' birthday parties were pretty much excuses for my aunt and uncle to have an adults party as well though
Not common here either
You just drop off your little gremlins and have an afternoon free
God bless birthdays and sleepovers
But that’s more of a family party too not a typical party with school friends
In portugal we always have to study the variants of portuguese (miraandese, brazilian, african, asian)
And the variants through time
Since Galician and Portuguese are related and share the same medieval origin and even some people consider them dialects of the same language, do you study anything about Portuguese
In Portugal, we only study some medieval poems in galego-portuguese but nothing about the modern language of galician
We also don't study anything about regional accents or dialects spoken in other Portuguese-speaking countries
we don't study about how they are different, but we do study works from different dialects of Portuguese
don´t you study any portuguese poets, d dinis for example
ai flores do verde pinho
We study some galician poets, I think the first poem on my portuguese literature textbook was by Martin Codax, ai ondas do mar de vigo
Gotta love bifanas my man
Well, since I speak some German, this is an interesting thread
My gut instinct says Germany since Standard German is more commonly spoken there than it is in Switzerland or Austria
But I have a feeling I'd assimilate more easily in Austria
It's a small country like mine and seems cosier, dunno
Can't imagine myself living in Switzerland, tbh
Germany
People seem more open and welcoming too, which on top of what you mentioned would make me go for Germany 100%.
Sure, but that's not an important factor to me
Well Porto Lisboa is cheap compared to Lisboa Faro which is 3 times that
the only thing outside Lisbon is the Portguese Navy and it's just across Lisbon, on the other side of the river
Not very common in Portugal
Very centralized in Lisbon
Only now with this new government they established some secretaries of state in the interior regions
Yes and some institutions/organizations may have their "HQ" in Porto but is just on paper, they still use the Lisbon offices as their main one (ex: AICEP)
Portugal is very centralized unfortunately
Which books from your country's required reading program did you struggle with the most
I'm a bookworm, I love books and reading, but even I had problems finishing some books for our Portuguese classes
Most notably:
* *Os Maias* (The Maias) by Eça de Queirós: super, super descriptive, the author could easily cut pages of unnecessary descriptions that add nothing to the plot
Plus, it criticizes Portuguese culture to a point of considering it worthless in comparison to British culture, who the author places on a pedestal
Then, there's that ending
Yikes
* *O Memorial do Convento* (Baltasar and Blimunda in the translated version) by José Saramago: I couldn't get behind the writing style with no punctuation
What about you
Though you weren't required to read it, " O livro do desassossego" (book of disquiet) really fucked up my grades
*Os Maias* it's awful
Couldn't finish it, even the professor hated the book and wanted us to read *A Cidade e as Serras* instead
I think it was the only book that we had to read that I genuinely didn't like
There are 16 pages describing what a house looks like
O Memorial do Convento may be my favourite book we read in school
I love Saramago, once I got behind the style with no punctuation I found his storytelling masterfull
*As Intermitências da Morte* it's my favourite book ever
MFW i didn't read either of the ones OP said and passed the exams and tests about them
The ammount of resumes and movies you can find about major reading program books is uncanny
( I know i somewhat am not adding anything new to the thread since it's the same as OP, but if you're currently going through a "reading program" it's likely you can find resumes of it on the web
I have nothing against José Saramago, but the fact that he writes the way he does it just makes it harder for me to enjoy his books
I once tried to read Memorial do Convento and I dropped it after the first 2 pages
Read it through some classmates notes to study for a test and never touched it again
And Maias
My god
That 80 something pages where he describes the house
It made me rip my hairs, it's awful
But I really enjoyed reading Fernando Pessoa and his heteronyms
Man, you're lucky you didn't have to read "O ano da morte de Ricardo Reis" it's so fucking boring I remember reading 10 pages and not a remembering a single thing of what I'd just read
Plus yeah yeah Saramagos writing style is shit
I did like "Os Maias" though, probably my favourite book I ever had to read for school
I never read it, but I saw [this really funny summary] of it on Youtube
I had no idea it was Cervantes's response/rant towards the old chivalry and knights' books
It's so petty and I love it
Same here
From my experience most non-humanities people either love *Os Maias* and hate *O Memorial do Convento* or vice-versa
Very few have actually read both, and I'm in the same camp as you
The sad thing is, without having delved further, I've been told that Eça de Queiroz has much more interesting books than that particular one, but I'm really not that interested in going further because of that bore
I enjoyed "Felizmente há Luar" and "O Auto da Barca do Inferno". Too bad our school didn't let us go to watch the play because of the profanity
This is curious, because all the people I know that were in the social sciences group ("Humanidades") really enjoyed "Os Maias" and I think all the people I know that went into other areas ended up hating it
I think the book taps a lot into one's taste for language and reading, so those who are not so much into that won't appreciate it as much
It could also have to do with the way the book is approached in classes
In my day, the Portuguese subject for the human sciences students was very different from the Portuguese classes that were taught for science/economics/arts students - they were even called different names ("Português A" and "Português B")
That could have played a major role in how people enjoyed the book
I wasn't counting the plays since those were already in the textbook and were pretty short but yeah a barca do inferno was pretty cool and we did see the play which to me made the story much better, but in terms of plays "Um auto de Gil Vicente" and "Frei Luis de Sousa" are much more interesting, and I just really like Almeida Garret's work in general
"Felizmente há Luar" wasn't in the program anymore so I never got to read it
That's weird
I actually remember watching both of those plays
"O Auto da Barca do Inferno" was really funny
I would also add "Frei Luís de Sousa" to your list
I hated having to read that
Even though it was a bit better than the other two
>"Felizmente há Luar" wasn't in the program anymore so I never got to read it
It's good, makes you understand better why Beresford got sent packing back to England by the rebels
> "Frei Luis de Sousa"
This is so ironically good
"Romeiro, romeiro
Quem és tu
" is bloody iconic
Older Portuguese stuff like Camões has the original text with only updated orthographic rules, I believe
For more modern stuff, it's not really an issue, as the language has kept stable-ish for the last 400 years or so
To add a Portuguese perspective to u/Marianations topic about *"Don Quijote"* being old Spanish, in Portugal *"Os Lusíadas"* by Luis de Camões is studied in its original version with old Portuguese
Which kinda makes it a drag to read but since it's poetry, it would lose all rhymes if it was translated to modern Portuguese
> as the language has kept stable-ish for the last 400 years or so
Not really, there have been plenty of ortographic changes, it's just that in more "modern works", it's not that much of a hassle nor does it affect the work when it's adapted into the current Portuguese spelling
"Os Lusíadas" is a special case because it's poetry and it has to obey rhyme and metric rules, so it's a lot trickier to adapt into modern writing
Most versions have updated orthography of the old words whenever it doesn't affect the metric
Just like you don't write Luiz de Camoens
Dama (dame/lady) is coming back into use in slang
It's being brought back from immigrants from the PALOPs and it's already part of the hiphop jargon
I hope you are joking I have been living here for 2 years now and food is terrible
I have a theory that the further south you go, the more of an extrovert you are
Brazilians complain that we are too serious and uptight, but then again people call us the Mediterranean Nordics, so what do I know
\*shrug\*
I never understood the siesta
How do you do it
Do you stop working and take a nap
Where do you sleep if you're not at home
Does everyone sleep or do you take turns
Thanks for explaining
Switzs don't have a sick society with a lot of poverty and social inequality, corruption, greed and drugs
So yeah, if you add guns to social inequalities, poverty, greed, corruption and drugs, you have mass shootings
Mass shooting and gun crimes in the US happen either because you have disturbed individuals or in situations like gang fights
Gang violence is clearly associated with a climate of poverty
When you grow up in a society that tells you that if you don't go to the best school, the best college, buy the finest clothes, a new iPhone every year, have a lot of sex and girls you are a loser and if you are a loser you deserve to end up being poor and homeless, I assume it's natural that you grow up being mentally disturbed and want to shoot people
You can ban guns in the US, they will still find a way to kill people, maybe not as effectively, but it won't cure the disease
I don't see Switzs looking down or treating badly the less fortunate of society, they take care of them
I don't see the Switzs denying medical healthcare to people if they can't afford it (they have private health care but it's heavily financed by the government and they help people who can't afford it), you don't see Switzs allowing companies to poison their natural resources and their people just for profit, you don't see Switzs sending their youngester to die in a far away land so that some companies can profit from a multibillion dollar war industry, you don't see Switzs allowing Big Pharma to pressure doctors to prescribe opiates to everyone leading to widespread opioid epidemic
I can go on
Former gun-owning American here
I've never heard anyone in my shooting circle cite Switzerland as the shining example of positive gun ownership given that the circumstances of ownership, social environment, and general culture are completely different
More or less, the reason we have/had a gun was simply because we could
Mass shootings make up a fraction of gun deaths in the US, and most lethal gun violence is committed with illegally obtained weapons anyway
Should there be more checks against people who want to buy weapons
Sure absolutely
The government cannot simply say "no more weapons" as it's unconstitutional
The challenge of whether weapons were intended for personal use was already decided by SCOTUS in 2008
In NJ where I'm from, the state can make it extremely difficult to get the permits and purchase docs ready, which isn't the case somewhere like Texas or Georgia
It's a complex issue that I don't expect non-Americans to understand, and here in Australia I constantly get people asking like "hurr durr why cant they just remove guns" - Viewing the violence issue back home in such a reductionist fashion is honestly just goofy as fuck
The culture around mass shootings is one that is regrettable, and sure banning guns might stop it but imho thats just a band-aid to the actual problem; what makes people want to do this to begin with
Maybe I'm an idealist, but theres a much deeper root to the problem simply than being able to buy an AR15
I'd argue their gun culture in general is a much bigger issue than gun laws
If I wanted to, yes
I live with my parents, I have no debt and I don't have hight monthly fixed costs
But I am trying to save up, so, no, I don't right now
And I believe I will never have enough disposable income if I keep living in Portugal for now ;\_\_ ;
Happens all the time
I hate it
Not really, but I often don't know how to translate certain English words to Portuguese
Holy crap, you guys exist on reddit
RTP1, it's owned by the State but I'm pretty sure they have freedom of speech there, I mean a comedy group had a show in that channel where they made fun of our prime minister for being a corrupt dumbass so it's not a "state propaganda channel" I guess
Now if you're talking about the number 1 most viewed channel, it's gotta be either SIC or TVI, they're not owned by the State, and they both share the title of the most viewed channel basically
SIC is the most watched, or at least it was in 2020
It's a general channel, with news, soaps, and daytime TV
It was also the first non-state broadcaster in Portugal, so that's nice
As for which channel is first on the programming grid, it's RTP1, which is the state broadcaster's original channel
RTP 1, the Portuguese Public Broadcasting Company, was the first TV channel to air in Portugal in the '50s. It broadcasts the most diverse content to please all types of people, but it isn't the most popular TV channel (from far), mainly because it doesn't broadcast typical Portuguese soap operas and reality shows like private channels do (Channel 3 - SIC and Channel 4 - TVI) in prime time (all of these are open-to-air)
CMTV for the most popular
Lol
I haven't seen much political satire in our State owned channel(s), but they haven't done as many comedy shows as they did back then, and that comedy group disbanded, while I'm pretty sure they made fun of other parties, they mostly made fun of our ex PM as I mentioned, simply because he's one of the main reasons portugal suffered so much during the euro crisis
Fun fact: said channel is funded by a special "audiovisual" tax on the electricity bill, even if you don't own a TV
Ah yes known for such hits as "Velório em direto"
Some years ago we had some changes in the way we actually write words, and since it's still really recent a lot of people still write some words the old way and are against it
We call it "novo acordo ortográfico" and it was created so that Brazilians and Portuguese could have a more cohesive way of writing things
Some examples:
Then: acção | vêem | recepção
Now: ação | veem | receção
And there's a lot more than this
It makes everything kind of confusing and actually not cohesive at all since some people (mostly 40+ yo) refuse to use it because it was not the way they learned things
With some words it actually makes sense removing certain letters as they're not really pronounced, but then theres words liked "Egipto" (Egypt) becoming "Egito", this despite the fact that everyone here pronounces the "p" and "Egípcio" (Egyptian) still retains it
E porque na sua base está mal feito, eu escrevo no novo acordo exceto para as palavras para/pára e em fato/facto
It doesn't work in Romance languages either and it usually does turn into incomprehensible gibberish if you try it, or at least it changes the intended meaning
And like u/Mahwan, I've also always been a bit jealous of that "trick" you can do in Germanic languages
At least in Portuguese, you use prepositions (usually "de" meaning "of") or turn one of the nouns into an adjective
For instance, tennis ball is literally ball of tennis and science fiction is literally scientific fiction
The last time that happened it lasted 60 years
If it were to happen again, I hope we'd be able to break the speed record
That would not last
to be sincere it would be beneficial for us economically but national pride would never allow that
Didn't go well for us the first time
BOIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII

If a country merges with another one that has 5 times more people, the interests of the bigger one will prevail because it has a lot more voters

But if the economy is destroyed, there will be nothing worth pillaging

I don't have anything against Spain
Everything I said here applies to any country merging with a significantly bigger country
I don’t have a clue
Yeah, what's up with that
I mean, you're not required to answer them
Neither do I.
I don't know why you use then
Since you are Romanian it's obvious you would say that
Romania has a very nationalistic identity and people from there usually don't like others commenting on their country
This is mainly due to the 1986 revolution and the political movements that came from that
Although a large portion of the population will say most were against the creation of the new parties, it could be argued that what really gave them strength to get going was the huge anti-fascist social movements that emerged from the aftermath of the crisis, that's pretty much explains why the country is the way it currently is and also why Romania sucks at football
(I'm sorry)
many traits of the Spanish Black Legend
Spain was not a specially evil empire
Plenty of other countries did as much of awful things as them
Well, Portugal turned out to be quite the Vietnam whenever someone tried to invade us so it's only half wrong
Probably Belém Tower, but we have a lot of other important monuments
Random fact: the Vietnamese language uses the Latin alphabet because Portuguese priests introduced it there
If you think our beer is bad, you clearly haven't tasted spanish beer
If we only count the mainland, France, under Napoleon tried three times and failed three times
Both are wrong actually
The first invasion was successful, and the french occupied Portugal
General Junot invaded through the Tagus Valley
This proved to be an awful decision, due to the difficult terrain and lack of infrastructure
Out of the 25000 men that crossed the portuguese border, only 10000 made it to Lisbon, and all cannons except for 4 were lost on the way
They reached Lisbon on the 30 of November 1807, entering Lisbon with only 1500 men, but there was no opposition, as the portuguese army was incredibly small and outdated, and composed mainly of popular militias
France held Portugal for around a year
Popular revolts, french lack of manpower (due to the Tagus Valley) and the help of the UK made it possible to expell the french
The battle of Vimeiro (the portuguese and british troops commanded by General Freire and General Wellesley) and the Convention of Sintra ended french occupation of Portugal
The second invasion wasn't as successful as the first one
The french plan, under General Soult, had the objective of conquering Porto first, and then Lisbon
They first tried to invade through the Minho River, but the only way to cross it was using fishing boats
Only 300 men could cross the river at the same time, and portuguese militias stationed on the other side made it impossible to cross
They then tried to invade through Chaves
This proved successful, and the french occupied Porto
The city was incredibly well defended, but the low quality of the portuguese army proved fatal
However, portuguese and british troops, under General Wellesley, General Beresford and Brigadier Silveira managed to take strategic positions around the city and further south (on the way to Lisbon), surrounding the french
Soult was forced to retreat north, leaving everything behind, except for food and ammo
The third invasion was headed by General Massena
Between the Second and Third invasions, the portuguese army was restructured and modernised, under the rule of General Wellesley
Wellesley had been given full control of portuguese troops, merging the portuguese and british armies
This new force was the Anglo-Portuguese Army
Lisbon's defense systems were also updated
Since the city is located on a peninsula, it can only be invaded by the north
There, a new line of defense infrastructure (named the Line of Torres Vedras) was built
Massena invaded through the Beiras region, with 65000 men
Upon reaching Torres Vedras, he realised he couldn't invade Lisbon
He held his position nearby for 4 weeks
Meanwhile, the portuguese troops were recieving more training, and were getting better and better (until then the portuguese army was incredibly outdated)
After those 4 weeks, he retreated to Santarém, to obtain food and other resources
But pressure from the anglo-portuguese army and local militias forced him to retreat north, to get more resources
The battles of Redinha and Sabugal and the Siege of Almeida put an end to this invasion
Everybody seats at the same table
From the baby to the 90 year old great-grandma
As far as I'm concerned, here in Portugal we're not used to do that
If they are 1-3 yo babies we have [this chairs] so they can be at our height
I'm the youngest member of my family and I'm 30 years old
When I was a kid, I was the only one
So I didn't need my own table
Not afaik
I've been doing it countless times, throughout my life
Not rude, though now that I think of it, it's not very common to see it happen
People just prefer to stop somewhere and eat, rather than eat while moving
Probably a cultural thing, given our relationship with food in general
Eating smelly, messy foods on small enclosed spaces like public transportation *is* frowned upon though and it's likely even not allowed
Rude
Thst sounds weird
Why would it offend people
Me too
But it can be rude to bring food into places or eating while interacting with other people
“The portuguese will not govern themselves and they won’t let anyone else govern them either”
Originally, it was supposedly said by julius caesar about the people that was here at the time
Julius Ceaser:
"At the ends of the Iberian Peninsula there's a people that doesn't govern itself nor does it let itself be governed
Portugueses courts are divided in 4 halls (called jurisdictions):
- Courts of Justice: headed by the Supreme Court of Justice, with 60 civilian judges and 4 military judges
- Administrative Courts: headed by the Supreme Court of Administration, with 26 judges
- Court of Auditors: with 19 judges
- Constitucional Court: with 13 judges
Then there are some special courts:
Peace Courts
Arbitral Tribunals
Ecclesiastic Tribunal
Pretty much the same as in English
But the pronunciation of 1 is a bit hard for foreigners
Structurally it's quite similar to English I guess:
* You read the numbers (> 20) in the order they're written, affected by their place in the overall number (i.e. no German switching around thing)
* Numbers 0-10 have very unique names, 11-19 have names clearly related to 1-9, and so do the multiples of 10 and multiples of 100 (i.e. no French "quatre-vingts" madness)
* Unlike English but like most other European languages I think, we separate the decimal part using a comma and pronounce it comma ("vírgula") as well, even though point ("ponto") is sometimes used as well
I'll try to focus on some differences and quirks:
* You always say "e" (and) between numbers, except between thousands and hundreds, e.g. 43 is quarenta e três, literally "forty and three". 29578 would be literally "twenty and nine thousand five hundred and seventy and eight".
* For some reason, the "e" is written, but never actually pronounced, at least in my experience, in the numbers 25, 26, 27 and for some people 28
* The number 100 itself is "cem" but in numbers from 101-199 you read the 1 as "cento" instead
* Like I said before, the numbers 200, 300, ..., 900 actually have their own names, even though they follow a general pattern
* Thousands are very similar to English: 3 is três, 1000 is mil, 3000 is três mil
The only difference is that we don't say the "one" in "one thousand".
* Millions are always plural, except for 1 million of course
And if there's nothing else after the million we add "de" (of)
So where in English you'd say "5 million people", we literally say "5 millions of people". Billions, trillions, etc
work the same way
* We use the long scale billion but we don't have unique words like "milliard" for 10\^9 and so on
We just say "a thousand millions" for instance
* Some numbers are conjugated according to gender - 1, 2 and all the multiples of 100 except 100 itself
You conjugate any instance of these numbers appearing in the middle of the number, e.g. the "1" in "51246". Digits that are above the million are always masculine though, because they apply to "millions" and not the thing the whole number applies to
* For ordinals, we make every component of the number into an ordinal
So "145th" is not "a hundred and forty fifth" but "hundredth fortieth fifth". This even applies to numbers like 12 with unique names - we don't have a unique word for "twelfth", we say "tenth second". The need for unique words for all of these means a lot of the higher ones aren't actually everyday words
I just realised I'm not actually sure how you say "200th" in Portuguese
same, but in Portuguese
With a small difference in that we separate the numerical parts (see 127, we say "cento e vinte e sete")
Unless in Spanish it is just a matter of preference and they do it both ways
I don't know much about Spanish
Latin speakers unite
if you are an English native, try to speak in English first and if it not works try to speak whatever gets you understood
Speaking Spanish in the first place would be seen as ignorance of your part in assuming Spanish is spoken in Portugal
If you are a Spanish native speaker, speak Spanish, Portuguese or English, no problem
Sorry France, you're too anglo saxon for us
But we'll let you sit at our table and share a beer (or wine)
French language has celtic and frankish (germanic) influences, although it's mostly vulgar latin (contrary to classical latin)
Some they will keep using
Because it is theirs and has been theirs for a very long time
In Lisbon I am thinking of the Navy dock which is still theirs to use on the same place since we have had a navy so 800+ish years or their arsenal installations (in arsenal street obviously) which has their arsenal since at least the 1500s. It is used formally even if not of practical use
Some military installations if less noble are being decommissioned - an old military factory complex is becoming this hipster business/arts centre, some old military hospitals or headquarters might become hotels (what else
maybe the pandemic will put a damper on it)
But a lot of things, if not totally impractical, it is still theirs
GNR still is headquartered in Quartel do Carmo and next to Belém Palace and a few other things
The [Beja Airbase]  was built in the 60's, established under a bilateral agreement with West Germany to be used the German Air-force for training purposes
After the German unification, it was no longer needed by Germany, so the Portuguese Air-force over all the installations
In 2009 a commercial terminal was established there
The project was a complete failure, jokingly people here in Portugal say that more probes have landed on Mars than commercial flights in Beja
Not sure whether or not I answered the survey
Surprised about the amount of Americans
I was thinking that the number was based on the amount of Americans asking questions over here, but they had to have filled out the survey correct
Thanks
Also sorry if what I wrote sounded harsh
Most of the American flags I see are usually from users asking questions here, whereas most of the American users residing in Europe (or Europeans residing in America) who I notice responding and participating in discussions have an American flag alongside another, hence my question
That's not to say they aren't part of the community though
Moonspell is probably our most famous band despite being a bit niche
Since Eurovision 3 years ago, Salvador Sobral might actually be the more famous
Moonspell and Madredeus would be the two Portuguese bands to reach some kind of international success
Both are rather niche bands and not exactly household names
Big metalheads generally know of Moonspell, but if you're not into metal then it's very unlikely that you've heard of them
As for individual singers, that would be Amália Rodrigues
She's the one to thank for Fado music being somewhat known outside of Portugal and eventually becoming UNESCO World Cultural Heritage
Amália Rodrigues
Salvador Sobral for about
2 months
Amália Rodrigues, Nelly Furtado, Shawn Mendes (only the father is portuguese, but still)
If we can count with Portuguese descendants, I’d say: Nelly Furtado, Shawn Mendes, Katy Perry, Sean Paul, Phil Demmel (Machine Head’s guitar player), Jay Kay (Jamiroquai’s vocalist), David Lee Roth (Van Halen’s vocalist), Joe Perry (Aerosmith’s guitar player), Steve Perry (Journey’s vocalist) and Sky Ferreira
guano apes
yanni
is he well known in greece too
I think that Marina Diamandis can also be included in that group since her father is Greek and she spent a good amount of her teenage years with him in Greece before moving to the UK in order to start her musical career
> Loïc Nottet deserves way more recognition imo
The guy is a legend when it comes to music
This
I think dEUS are have been quite popular around europe, if you're into that genre
eu tinha a ideia que a Aurea também tinha algun sucesso internacional mas posso tar enganado
mal a conheço fora de quando via casualmente o the voice
I think because of "more than words" bettencourt is probably the most successful portuguese musician, although no one knows/cares that he's portuguese
Generally you greet drivers, people working in shops and restaurants, at the front desk, etc
basically aknowledging their existance verbally
Also not uncommon to greet your neighbors and people you come across when on a walk, though the latter is more common if there aren't that many people where you are
You don't need to say anything to the bus driver in Portugal unless you're buying a ticket
If you have a pass you just swipe it on the machine
As a portuguese, I would never do that
Unless the bus was empty and I knew the bus driver
In a big city, when there's a lot of people wanting to go on the bus, I never greet the bus driver - most people, in my experience, never do it as well
If the bus is empty and i'm the only one getting in, I might say good morning or nod, but that's it really
Shit, I thought germans were a lot different from us but it looks like you are describing the portuguese people in the supermarket
Exiting the lift only to be greeted by someone standing in front of it waiting to get
Don't forget to apologize
I witnessed that so often when I was studying in Scotland
That's happened a few times to me in Portugal, but yes it's more likely people laugh about it in the UK
I both like and feel confused by it
I appreciate the politeness, but also feel like there's unnecessary ant excesive apologizing going on
I think "desculpe" is perfectly acceptable in those situations
It's pretty synonymous with "com licença" in that context
I guess I didn't really think of "sorry" as being the same thing as "excuse me". I genuinely thought people were apologizing when there was no need
Nutri Ventures, the cartoon was fun and the theme song was a bop
Yes, and after that Plague Dogs, which as you may have already guessed is about doggies
In Portugal’s Portuguese, “rapariga” just means girl
In Brazil’s Portuguese it sort of means prostitute
So saying like “I’m talking/seeing this “rapariga” “will have a very different meaning in each country
It's not the same language, but in Spanish, "pila" means battery, and in Portuguese means dick
Also, in Spanish "me **meo**" means 'to piss myself', but in Portugal, [MEO] is a big telecommunications brand
In Portuguese from Portugal "rapariga" its girl but in Portuguese from Brazil "rapariga" its bitch
In European Portuguese "rapariga" means girl, so saying "olha ali aquela rapariga" (look at that girl over there) is pretty common
In Brazilian portuguese "rapariga" actually means whore, so saying the exact same thing "olha ali aquela rapariga" actually means "look at that whore over there".
Some Brazilian friends mocked me for a while because of this
Also in Portugal the word "pau" is fairly common and means stick/wood (and can also be used as slang for Euros), but in Brazil they often use it as slang for "dick".
"Sen hora" is not as similar to the Portuguese "senhora" as it seems
That Portuguese word breaks into syllables in this way: se-nho-ra
Bicha is a word with a double meaning though
It means both queue (in some parts of the country) but it also means faggot
Everything else is absolutely on point
You're not a true Portuguese if you don't have a beard
The popularity drops in part because of white/gray hair, as soon as grey starts showing in the beard most man decide to start shaving
You're not a true Portuguese if you don't have a ~~beard~~  mustache
Moustache is a requirement
Beard is optional
There was a time when a friend of mine was like, what do you think about the photo on my profile
I told him, looks good, you look exactly like the stereotypical portuguese with that mustache
He was like, dude I was talking about the banner
Sadly my mustache only looks good with a beard accompanying it :/
Honestly I'm confident
We aren't playing well but we didn't won the cup playing a brilliant football
We have a good mix of youth and experience and amazing players for most of positions
And most important, we play as a team were they seem to be playing together for a long time
So yeah, let's go Portugal
Oh, yeah, do pretty bad in the group stage but scrape by because we can end third on the group and pass
It is an interesting group though : world champions, european champions, the host country of that group (or tournament) which is Hungary and then Germany
I think this is memorable as a likely "group of death".
We will give it a try
I am not sure if we have finished trolling football fans
edit - if you want a specific scenario, a hunch that it is going to look like the third best of our group will not qualify and we are on real danger of crashing out and then somehow we end up SECOND in group and third place does not qualify
With that group stage and how meh we're doing at the WC qualifying right now i'm not sure but i do think we got a good team and if we won the euros with a much inferior team i believe there's an even bigger chance to win it this time again
Lmao we, the french and the german are talking shit about ourselves  and the hungarys are chilling like it as a normal group
Well considering that Portugal is in the group of death
I'm not really sure
Portugal has a great pool of players who are in form but cannot seem to gel together when playing on field
Whoever gets out of that group alive surely will reach the final
You calm down now, Éder will not be called for the euros
Considering that the four best third placed teams will also pass the group stage, I think that Portugal, Germany and France will all advance to the round of 16
I think the group will be France first, Portugal second, Germany third, Hungary last
We will beat the record and win euro2021 only with draws
Probably the most talented set of players in our history trained by an old men who knows shit about football
"We play as a team" oh boy you must have missed some of our games hmm
Nandinho Santos would love this
He's more than an idol, he's like a god hahaha
Sincerely now, he has become the simbol of that tournament, when you talk about Éder, you remember euro2016
He is not an idol exactly, because he has a very quiet life
He is very nice, and had this very hard childhood, so he would be liked even if he did not score that goal, but now he has godhood-meme status
Difficult to describe
Hope he has a good life
He might be paid lots of coffees and meals by strangers for the rest of his life though
I wouldn't mind it either
God bless Lord Éder
German
I really don't understand why so many people dislike German
Not only i think it sounds beautiful, but in my mind is th inly proper language for poetry
Russian, it just sounds great
I really like Japanese, since I'm a weeb and I'm quite used to the language by now
It has some familiar sounds and some quite unfamiliar ones too
Some words are really strange, while others sound super nice
European, I'd say Greek
For some reason it has this rythm and tine that I really like
The funniest part is that in the middle of gibberish, sometimes a word I know pops up (like "democracy")
That's always hilarious to me
Is there an historic figure that is considered a villain in your country but a hero in another
Napoleon is viewed positively in several countries, but is considered a tyrant in Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom, responsible for many deaths, rapes and looting
Similarly, William Beresford was choosen by the British goverment to organize the Portuguese army after the King fled to Brazil, but he began to demand more and more power, even sentencing to death a group of rebels who were trying to get the King to return, and made no secret that he thought the British were superior to the Portuguese
This lead to him being kicked out of the country and return to the UK were we mas named Master General of Ordnance
Are there similar cases in your country
EDIT: Oh my God
I wasn't expecting so many responses
Thank you so much
All Philips were hated in Portugal, but specially the Filipe III
I get the men, but what did Catherine do Poland
What is the British opinion of him
Neutral
We have the Duke of Wellington in high regard, but not Beresford
Trafalgar is not a person though
Frederick and Catherine were the monarchs behind the partition of Poland
We almost lost Brazil to the Dutch because of him
He raised the taxes extremely high, threatened to close the ports, and all that money went to Madrid
No wonder people were pissed
I'm talking about your Filipe IV, which was our Filipe III
Fawkes or V?
Olivares was his most trusted advisor so I would put the blame on both of them
The funny thing is, the previous Filipes left Portugal rather autonomous, if Filipe number III/IV hadn't gotten greedy they probably wouldn't revolt
until much later
English is useful as a language almost everyone can speak a little
Our language is the way we speak at home, with your family
Thanks to Brazil, I think my language is here to stay for a while
But with the widespread of social media, I can see European Portuguese disappear in favour of Brazilian Portuguese
So if you think about it a sentence here and there could have way more impact than you believe
I mean in just a couple of years we started to use english expressions/words a lot more often
In another couple of years more and more english words will be used
So perhaps in the future our languages won't be so far apart as we may think no
Another comment in this thread by a dutch:
>"There was [an article] two weeks ago about how Dutch children are increasingly spelling words the English way
For example, they are spelling *koffiee* as "coffee", and *familie* as "family", *koelkast* as "coolkast".
>There are also other regular articles about [*verengelsing*] For example, [in universities] In [Amsterdam] it's got to the point where sales and wait staff speak mostly English
Amsterdam is rapidly becoming an English-language city, I would say
It's not unusual for Dutch speakers working in Amsterdam to stay in English even when dealing with other Dutch people
So, yes, some people are worried about this
The language is strong, but English is a threat
Interesting fact:  When the Netherlands was invaded by the French around 1800, French became the official language for a few years
I witnessed it in Wandavision when Wanda was talking to young pietro in english which really annoyed me
It might, around the world
There's so many Brazilians and they move around so much
In Portugal, I don't believe that the European Portuguese would be replaced
We have so many Brazilian friends, we see so many Brazilian telenovelas and we still speak European Portuguese
That's really interesting
I felt the same when going to algarve
It was sad
But for you it's worse since it's your own capital that's being affected
2009, when Bitcoin was dirt cheap
At the time I was a child so I didn't know about it and didn't have any money to invest in it
If I didn't take Bitcoin into consideration I would say the best times in Portugal were the early 2000's. Since 2009/2010 Portugal has been a completely unstable place when it comes to politics and economics

The dragon ball dub is a pretty famous one
It's full of jokes about famous people or weird events related to Portugal
Some say it's the best dub in the world but I think it's most due to nostalgic memories since it first premiered in 1995
For me it's awful, the dub it's mostly improvised dialogs, they just ignore the actual thing that's being said that is important to the story to make a joke
Our Dragon Ball dub is something unbeliavable
Brazilians thought it was a parody when they watch it
Names were changed, accents were added, jokes no one outside Portugal would understand
It's insane and we love it
We got ours from France
Picollo was translated to Coraçãozinho de Satã (little heart of Satan)
Pretty unique, wouldn't you say
Portugal has 4
Lisbon, Porto, Braga and Loulé.
There's 5 IKEA in Portugal
Don't know the exact number but we have some here in Portugal
Low quality stuff but you always find something when u get there
It's not in Porto btw, it's in Matosinhos
I was bored and went to their website, we have 5 Ikea stores
Well, in that case there aren't any in Lisbon also
There's one in Alfragide and one in Loures
There's one right here in Alverca where I live haha
Thought we had more though
I'm wrong after all, we have an AKI and not an IKEA here
Yeah, you just made me visit the website again to check that ahahaha the closest Ikea from you is in Loures
I knew northern europe tended to be racist but I never thought it would be that bad, especially in Sweden and Finland
There's racism here too but not to that extent, except towards romani, /r/portugal is a big racist circlejerk against romani, besides this we tend to be very acceptive
I think Portugal is one of the least racist european countries along with Spain
I usually don't defend Portugal but this is one of the few things  I really love about my country
>except towards romani
It's not toward romani, it's toward ciganos (romani are just lumped in it too since some came in the very last years from central and eastern Europe because "Heh, both are gypsies anyway lel")
But yeah, racism is real against gypsies in Portugal and it's shockingly spread as if it was normal or something
Southern Europe
And western Europe since just about everything is east of us
Mediterranean even though we are not in the Mediterranean, it's mostly because of the lifestyle and dietary
Portugal is southern European and the most western too
I'm Azorean so I'm even more western
I see Portugal as Western Europe, Southern is mostly Mediterranean oriented
Iberians would be one which everyone agrees is right
This is wrong
We never identify with Mediterranean
In our foreign policy the debate is European VS Atlantic
In the sense, should we prioritize Brazil, Angola, etc, the Portuguese speaking world (Community of Portuguese Speaking Nations), and UK (traditional ally)
or Europe and the EU
This is  the real thing that actually exists and it's debated officially
Also, because the Mediterranean trade routes (and Mediterranean people's expansion efforts) did reach our country
There's obviously a very strong Mediterranean cultural element, especially in the South
>Mediterranean even though we are not in the Mediterranean, i
not most people
We are southern europe maybe and western europe maybe, but the mediterranean thing is so stupid
And often people who overstate the similarities really are not very aware of a lot of very specific dissimilarities
Not the only one
Some tourists get surprised every year by that, so,e even die over it by seriously having no ocean sense at all
I should be mad but that's so accurate I can't disagree
If you mean ultramarine territories, not sure they count as EUROPE to be a region of Europe
Also Iceland is not further west than Portugal, sorry
Its westernmost point is east of the Azores and they are all islands anyway
You might want to look at a map mate
[This] informative video might blow your mind then
I get what you're saying, but the Mediterranean influence on Portugal goes quite a bit further
It has been visited and/or settled by numerous Mediterranean civilizations (the Phoenician, Carthaginians , people from North Africa, Romans, and so on)
Mediterranean trade routes by sea reached all the way into Portugal (my hometown was important because it was the last stop on multiple Mediterranean trade routes, as it was the northernmost navigable settlement on the Guadiana River)
Our climate is mostly Mediterranean, and thus we share most of our fauna and flora with the Mediterranean countries
The Algarve has reasonably warm waters, due to Mediterranean influence
Are we geographically in the Mediterranean
Certainly not, but I think there's a good case to affirm that we're more of a Mediterranean people than anything else
The mediterranean has hardly any tides - idiots trying to lay their towel by the waterline and come back a few hours later will be in for a surprise
The mediterranean also has hardly any waves - not such a big deal in summer or in a more sheltered beach but foreigners might have no clue some waves which come really will be bigger than all the others
Tides and waves make for currents
Riptides are particularly dangerous and they might have absolutely no clue what that is
I remember a redditor from IIRC Croatia saying as long as you swam well, you would be fine which is an extremely silly way to think
Then there are people who can look at the damp waterline and walk into caves or other beaches and then be very surprised if the tide is coming in
Our tidal variations is usually on the 2-5 meters depending obviously time of the year and phase of the moon
(On the mainland, it is milder on the islands)
But a lot of foreigners just have no clue at all even about a weak 2 meter tide
You said Iceland
The azores are precisely the same europe as Iceland- peaks of the mid Atlantic ridge peaking out of the ocean, part on the European tectonic plate, part on the North American one, and spreading out apart a few cm a year
If you say Iceland is more western than Portugal, no, because if Iceland counts so do the azores
If islands do not count, we win as well
Nor have I ever been asked to or been with guests that wanted to do so in my house
Hey I may as well ask it here: so there's countries were people take their shoes off, right
What happens when a contractor or a cleaning lady or whoever needs to do a job at your home gets there
Does he take his shoes off too
Here, from my experience and I think everyone I know, it's normal to wear your shoes inside, and it is even considered rude to take them off at someone else's place
Personally I love walking around barefoot, but I know a lot of people who actually hate it
I walk into my room or wherever I've left my slippers and then change, sure
Sweaty feet, down here usually the weather's in the 25-40º range and feet might not smell like roses after a day of walking around in shoes, plus in a dry climate shoes aren't really that dirty aside from dust unless you're wandering around in mud or something
Not really
Maybe in humid climates, but no one likes stinky feet after being in your shoes in 30º+ weather
And shoes generally aren't that dirty unless you've been prancing around in the mud, plus that's why you have a doormat
Because of hot weather
I'm not sure if you realize what 30ºC temperatures are to be saying that
Pretty damn sure your feet have germs too after walking around all day
I don't think it's a good idea to take off my shoes in public, hey
Maybe that's a thing in Iceland, I wouldn't know
Because socks would get dusty
I don't think taking off your shoes when you go to someone's house is what would make a difference in how your feet smell then
Francesinha is the best "poor people food" in my country
[The macdonalds Imperial in Porto] fames itself with being one of the nicest looking macdonalds buildings out there
[The interior] is also kind of fancy
The building used to be an iconic café from the 1930s, that got turned into a macdonalds in 1995
[Here's an article] about the whole thing
It used to be
The [Imperial McDonald's in Porto] is well known for being particularly [beautiful/fancy] On top of that, it's also [located] in the most important avenue of the city (Avenida dos Aliados)
McDonald's being smart by getting a fancy building in each country as a way to attract tourists and get free publicity
well, i haven't seen any portuguese answers yes sooo
im sure every portuguese agrees that pimba basically defines us besides fado
so with that im mind, "Peitos da Cabritinha" - Quim Barreiros
Sorry but my vote goes to "A minha casinha" by Xutos e Pontapés. But I respect your choice XD
Yes it is fairly normal
Duck and rabbits are commonly used in our food, not the most common but still common, they are normally served with rice
Duck, rabbit, normal
Deers
Never heard of
Wild boars
Some people in fact hunt them, but because of diseases and such its rarely eaten
All those kinds of meat are eaten here in Portugal
The most common of the three is duck, as duck rice is a fairly popular dish, but both rabbit and deer are available in supermarkets, and are often a fixture in more rural restaurants in areas known for hunting (like my own), where those meats are locally available
Yes
I was very surprised when I found it is not in other countries
I remember mentioning this to a friend from Brazil and she reacted as if I had eaten a cat and I just thought she was joking
Yeah, it is pretty normal to eat rabbits here
But fish and chips are sort of frowned upon here, people just don't think they mix well
Yes
We have rabbit in almost all supermarkets
Snails, squids and octopus
All that things that makes some outsiders go crazy
I love it all
[Yes and it can be amazing when done properly]
I looove Duck with rice
That's literally the F*CKING BEST
What do you think about Portugal
Do you like living here
Not OP of the comment, but
I love it
Portugal is amazing, the portuguese are amazing
I've been so well received by you guys here
It's been pretty great
Glad you like mate
Cheers mate hope things keep going well for you
I’d say generally speaking you can count on the countries who are historical rivals to be be quite similar to one another
For example, Spain and Portugal
I agree, quite similar
And you are right, most Turks and Greeks don’t accept or even acknowledge that
I guess in the North, in both sides, that’s more accepted
You want to angry every portuguese person on this sub, why
Someone call Padeira de Aljubarrota now
>Spain and Portugal
Portugal and galicia yes, the rest of Spain no
I disagree deeply, and hope wholeheartedly for the Iberian union to never happen again, as it was - indisputably - the worst 60 years in our history by every possible prism imaginable
Death is preferable to be under Spanish rule or any Iberian union
Some might, I am not saying the opposite
I have good Greek friends and only when I place them between a rock and a hard place they will admit it
Spain has a terrible historical rapsheet of not having its' region's best interest at heart, when it comes to decision-making
I have no reasons what-so-ever to believe it would be any different if Portugal were one of those regions
Spain has serious separatist movements with expressive political presence, Portugal doesn't.
Wait a minute
Roberto Begnini is in this movie
I'm in
Their relationship with alcohol is seriously disturbing for something from a southern european country
They are not alone on it, russians as well, and british people all can be very different, but there is this specific moroseness, alcohol on fridays has this specific important place, that it can be really alienating
The danes maybe a little less on this
This is so odd for me
My father saw his parents three/four times a week, minimum
He would either dine or have lunch with them, and on saturdays he would occasionally take them out to the countryside with his brothers for some solo family time
Furthermore we would have a full family meeting every sunday, with all the aunts, uncles, cousins and even family friends
This continued until both of them passed away, I'm happy they never felt lonely
Not really, thankfully there's the etymology of every element's name on the back of my textbook so it's not that bad
Are the regional languages in your country commonly spoken or not
Does the youth speak them
The title says it all really, but I feel I can't leave this part unwritten so here it is
A meaningless text that you wasted time reading
Quite bad
There is only sushi, chinese food, maybe some african and indian food and Italian restaurants are not very common
In Portugal we really like our cuisine, so like 90% of our restaurants serve Portugue food
In Portugal we have it all, kebab shops, Brazilian BBQ, Chinese, Japanese, a few African restaurants like Angola and Cape verde food
This is mostly in Lisbon due to the large amount of foreigners and immigrants, for the rest of the country is mainly traditional portuguese restaurants with some Italians here and there
I'm from Lisbon and there's loads of options for almost every kind of foreign food except African food for some reason
There's a couple places with food from former Portuguese colonies but no Eritrean, Ethipian food which I miss from when I lived in London
Other than that, just where I live I have access (in a 10 minute walk) to Italian, Chinese, Japanese and Mexican food
In bigger cities you get the common ethnic food - chinese, sushi, italian, indian and in Lisbon you have lots of african food shops
In smaller towns, you get the obligatory chinese and that's that
Piri piri is hot spicy used in cousin of  all the PALOP ( português spiking country) .

True, when you start winning we will switch ronaldo for our lord and savior *ÉDER*, and them we will draw that shit
LONG LIVE ÉDER
Exacly, thats why we also need payet to *accidentaly* injure him, its all part of the plan, just like the entirety of 2016 euro was
People usually call it "e comercial", literally "commercial and".
I just call it the "and". I mean, I barely call it anything since I barely see it, I mostly see it on company names and stuff like that
Well I've always heard it pronounced like "e", not like "e" :p
To be fair, Ireland, the island, is *veeery* far way from Britain, so it doesn't really matter much
At least that's what I learnt from this 18th century colonial map
Though I'm supposed to talk about Portugal (since it's the European country I'm from), I *need* to talk about what irks me in Brazilian culture
And that is: the need to be an extrovert and smile all the time
I'm as introverted as someone can get and if there's one thing I hate, is fake smiles and fakeness in social settings in general
I'm more on the side of the Russians on this regard; I value emotional honesty quite a bit
This means that sure, you won't see me smiling and laughing a lot, but when I do, you know I mean it
Same thing with complimenting someone and stuff like that
Bullfights (touradas) it's a medieval disgusting "tradition", it's just stupid that it still exists
Bullfighting
Those weren't drugs
Same here, I think it's very common in all Southern European cultures
Came here to write this
The amount of people in Portugal supporting bullfights is still high, and it makes me embarrassed of being portuguese
I think the numbers are actually decreasing but yes, it's still very high, unfortunately
Too many agro-betos ahhaha
Never happened to me or to anyone I know for that matter
Not at a kebab place (which aren't that common, anyway), but I remember a "witty waiter" telling me something like
> "Oh, you're not meeting your sweetheart today, huh
when I ordered my salad with extra onions, when I was like 15 or 16
I don't think there is a specific reason for being the capital but a combination of many reasons first was an important city in the Roman and Arabian rule of the peninsula
Lisbon is in the centre of the country, it's in the river mouth of the biggest river in Portugal and the hole Iberian Peninsula and it's an estuary so a natural safe harbour
The river is easily navigable and the tejo valley is a very fertile region
This was very important in the pre Industrial Revolution times
I would say it's almost a perfect location if not perfect for a capital city
It was safe for the king to return from Rio de Janeiro, and Lisbon was the biggest city in Portugal and the capital before it was in Rio, so it was an obvious choice
Portugal doesn't actually have a formal capital
Although it has been traditionally Lisbon . It was initially as a way to protect sovereignty in case of invasion
The capital would be wherever the King was
It was rio de janeiro (Brazil) during the French invasion for example
After it was simply never formalized and it became sort of a tradition for it to be this way
I'm Glad you asked: "Estou-me a cagar" lit
I am shitting myself; "Estou-me nas tintas" lit
I am in the paint; "Estou-me a borrifar" Really hard to translate, something like I am sprinkling water on myself; "Estou a marimbar" I am playing a marimba (african musical instrument)
We had some sort of a colony from 1415 to 1999 making us the longest colonial "power" in Europe
Edit: oopsie doopsie I get information from the wrong sources, consider the dates as 1415 to 1975 then
The popular food chain "Nando's" is not Portuguese, the owner is from South Africa
If you wanna eat good chicken in Portugal, try one of the traditional churrasqueiras
No one was calling Macau a colony in the 1990's, it was just an enclave- same as Hong Kong was for Britain
By that token, France would still be a colonial power nowadays due to the french Guyana or Spain due to Melilla or England due to the Falklands
funny language and grandayy
I went there last year, but as a tourist my views are probably skewed
Overall I really liked it
People were friendly and it was easy to communicate because everyone spoke English
The public transportation was also quite good, we never had much trouble going anywhere
I'd say the low points were the traffic, which was a bit chaotic from the airport to Valletta, and the streets which weren't always as clean as they should (but I can't complain too much considering my own country)
I went there during the aftermath of a big scandal involving a journalist who was found dead in weird circumstances (I think that's it
) and there were posters and stuff in some places but it never bothered us too much
Smaller than us, and that's good
Keep it up
Disse íse da uiei da pórtiuguíse accénte úde luque laique ífe uritene da ueie íte íse sepouquéne bai pórtiuguíse pípel
Honestly I probably got the accents wrong
And I had to think for a bit how to write "would" (I chose "úde" as there's no "w" in the Portuguese alphabet)
Dis is de béste subreddit dete ai eve evere sine
Ites sou mache fane raiting dis uei, ai cude nevere guete enafe
Uáte da fóque dide iu djâste faquingue sei abaute mi, iu litâle bíteche
Ai donte noue OP
Hárd tu sei
Tbf that's how a lot of Portuguese people actually say it
Edit: also "uiei" should be "uei", right
One example is Mourinho’s accent, (although it could be a lot worse) specially in his first Chelsea interviews
Another funny example is the portuguese playboy Zezé Camarinha
In my opinion our english accent has a lot of harsh consonants (that thing vs dat ting), and we struggle with things like ‘th’
Yeah that makes more sense
My dad is weird in that he doesn't pronounce the "th" sound as a "d" sound
Rather he pronounces as a sort of "z" or "s" sound, almost like a German would
Not sure why he does that
Some José saramago like "ensaio da cegueira" its really good and really on point now, its about a pandemic blindness and all that it brings
Blindness by Saramago
"On Blindness" by José Saramago is really fitting and is a really great, compelling book
Personally, I would also recommend "The Book of Disquiet" by Fernando Pessoa it's a lifelong work and his life story is really interesting
The way he writes as different people is something uncanny
.Os Maias (the Maias) by Eça de Queiroz (its really good, its about portugueses society in the late 19 century, its a social critic, with themes of nature vs social environment and many more , that has a shocking revelation at the end
.Ensaio sobre a cegueira (blindness) by José Saramago
.Memorial do Convento (Covent memorial) by José Saramago
Oh wow I just picked up another one of his books
Haven't started reading but I picked out of the blue
The boy of the mountain, is it good
It's great, I've only read the first 2
The Baron in the trees is one of my favourite books, it touches in so many topics and ideas
Because Spain is both our ally and our biggest export
Portugal can't take the risk of losing the alliance with Spain, especially after so many centuries of turmoil
And the situation in Catalonia isn't very clear: do all Catalans want independence or just a separatist group
Not really
Even if the turnout was large, the result was 52 to 48%, hardly a clear win
Learning that the verb "to be" is actually actually two verbs with separete meanings in Portuguese, the verbs "ser" and "estar". It also doesn't help that their conjugations are very irregular and difficult overall
I think the same situation happens when trying to learn Spanish or Italian
Coming from Portuguese and English, it's really weird to not need to use the Plusquamperfekt, it actually takes a lot of effort to convince yourself that it's not what you're supposed to use
We actually use "Que tal
" in Portugal too but it's far from being the most standard greeting
Weird how Portugal is so different
Some primary school teachers prefer "tu" but generally you're supposed to address them as "professor/professora" and in third person
I actually remember my teacher teaching us how to address her properly, and she was still in her 20s at the time (late 90s)
Then once you leave primary school, it's not acceptable to say "tu" anymore
In university it's also never acceptable
And the thing is, if a teacher/professor/teaching assistant insists on being called by first name and using "tu", students tend to find it too awkward and don't take up the offer
>Here teachers tend to be closer to the students, you can joke with them as long as you remember they are the authority
dude, you can do that as well even if you are calling them professor and using formal modes
You can do that with just basically everybody, it is not related to using tu or not
In Portugal, no, the default is becoming the third person, with the choice of pronoun used being a subtle meaningful choice
"Tudo bem
" is definitely way more common here too
"Que tal
" is something you'll hear like 5% of the time
We also often say "Então?", usually informally
It literally means something like "so" or "then". You can combine it with the other ones as well: "Então, tudo bem
" or "Então, que tal
To be fair, you guys use tu way more often than us in other social contexts too
For instance, going to a shop and calling the salesperson tu isn't common here
So it makes sense that formal treatment seems harsher than in Portugal
Nonetheless I disagree with u/uyth
There's a bit of a social barrier that's harder to get over when you're in formal terms with a person, in my experience
-inho/inha depending if you are a boy or a girl
many diminutives are also nicknames, specially if you are young
for non diminutive nicknames there's no clear rule
That's also mean saying goodbye to Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp, are we good
Oh fuck yes
Crossing fingers
Adeus
Adiós. Addio
Au revoir
Goodfuckingbye

Tbh the only reason I still use FB is for the pages and events
Makes organizing something easy
Other than that it's so dull
Don’t forget that Facebook owns instagram and whatsapp
Yes pls
Finally 2020 has something good for us
Before facebook, can they just shut down instagram
I only use it to follow bands, to know when they're releasing new stuff and playing shows
good
Please do
Oh no, what will we do without Facebook
It's not like there are hundreds of other social media platforms where we can make publications, communicate with other users, plan events, and form groups
Them not leaving, and we not budging, means they have to change their regulations
As long as regulators don't back down, we win either way
My reaction as well
Facebook owns Instagram and Whatsapp they're not gonna die
Same in Portugal lol

This man is the European Chad, bravo Macron
We should lock this people up in a mental institution, they still believe in imaginary friends
Another day, another misinformed person about what freedom of speech means
Freedom of speech is solely the guarantee that you will not be prosecuted legally by a country's authorities for what you say/write
It means exactly what Macron is saying in the video, that it is not his place as President to stop people from saying what they want
It IS NOT, i repeat, IT IS NOT, the guarantee that what you say/write won't have consequences on your life, like being shunned by acquaintances, lose job opportunities or be denied access to a private platform to say/write your opinions, as long as any of these consequences don't clash with any existing laws
Reddit is an american private company, and you accepted their agreement when you joined the website
These discussions are hosted on their servers, for which they pay money
You have absolutely no rights when it comes to your access to the platform, and if the company refuses to provide you their platform, it's their fucking right
How would that be enforced
I was told only the charger needs to be universal, what about the ports to the phones
Apple can just make a Lightning to USB-C cable and sell it
What will happen when there's a new and better technology
Either everyone changes at the same time or they can't use it
That's actually terrible for development
Great stuff
I feel like electric cars need the same law
Maybe now Apple will stop it's bullshitery
Good
Thanks my dude
I don't know if you're also responsible for that, but I love VLSub
Amazing

I saw the British Museum in November 2019 and the Greek new museum (sorry forgot its name) January 2020
The Greek ones are complete but they are all copies
The true ones are in London
And yes, i think they should be moved back to Athens but that's beside the point, the point is this meme is fake
> I would love it if I went to a museum in China and saw it full of random British artifacts
I wouldn't. I like it when they are in Europe
>Great Britain and stealing artifacts from all over the world, name a more iconic duo
Dude, try that with a different flair
I have been to Berlin´s museum island actually
Awesome
They sure were trying to give the brits real competition on that
Do not throw stones if you have glass roofs yourself
>Yes truly deplorable, that’s why we have a program and a history of returning artifacts to their rightful owners

After a certain point, they will have been there for longer than in the spot the original buyer placed them in

When is this circus gonna end
Ok so here is what is going to happen
European "leaders" will say they don't condone this and that, and that they won't support violence or war, they will also say that they hope that peaceful dialogue will take place and everything will be over quickly and in a non-violent democratic way
What will happen is, the US will say something along the lines of "you better be with us in this, or else
", the European leaders will bow down as usual and war "for democracy" will ensue
What's happening
I'm out of the loop i just woke up

Trump is just a symptom of the polarization of American politics
Join to that a systematical glorification of ignorance, a weak social ladder wich causes families to remain poor for generations and complete control of media outlets (fox) by republican politicians (at this point is literally propaganda) and it becomes pretty clear that another "Trumpian" leader will soon follow
Agree, Portugal and Spain should be in charge of the whole world again just like the old times

Every monarchy still standing is an embarrassment to the continent
Well if you want to go by actual power, then she had about as much power as Constantine did throughout his reign
Why are the english so perverted
You act like you wanna fuck this 90 yo woman
well he had a deal with his brother that constantine's children will rule after them so who realy failed was constantine that only had two daughters
> Elizabeth has power, she just chooses to not use it because if she overstepped her bounds that would mean the end of monarchy in Britain
Come now
She doesn't exercise her power for the same reason Constantine didn't, they'd be removed from power if they tried going outside of their limits

Funny thing is Dabra actually becomes a very nice guy later on in  the series

Except for maps about food consumption where Portugal is #1
We knew all along that Portugal is an eastern European country
We into Eastern Europe once more
Actually I would add a "very good results" and put the Nordic countries, Germany and NL in there
Good results we remove Slovenia and Greece and put them into OK results-
Average we remove Turkey and put them into Worrying
Now it's perfect
EDIT:   I made this one, looks better IMO, I would still add some things but it would look too complicated, it's still not too late to invest in Eastern Poland
Slovenia has good results
As a Portuguese citizen: Hey
We're not slightly worse than average all the time
Except Portugal ranks very well in many things that aren't economy related but sure
I would put Spain, Italy and Greece in the okay results
Other than that it looks pretty good
Consumo de tremoços per capita, ninguém nos ganha aí
And weather
Just imagine a little orange area in the black sea attached to Ukraine
Lately Portugal has better results than Italy and Greece (and even Spain)
Actual commentary from 1872 by one of the most famous Portuguese writer and Portuguese Consul to France and the UK:
>*“We are in a comparable, correlated state to Greece: the same poverty, the same political indignity, the same lowness of character, the same public corruption, the same usury, the same spiritual decadence, the same administration with grotesque sloppiness and confusion
In foreign books, in their magazines, when they want to talk of a Christian country that, due to it's progressive decadence, may come to be wiped off the map, Portugal and Greece are mentioned, side by side
Not much has changed
But Greece has good results
That is so true
Polish friends of mine were making fun of us for our "sh" sounds, when they were making exactly the same sounds
Why Spain
Portugal is older and its own language and culture, besides other things
That's just extremely offensive
You wouldn't call a Scot English
> What do you mean remove Slovenia
Unlike all of your dangerous countries, we're an oasis of safety and not exactly behind in anything else noteworthy except size of paycheck
Then we rank Portugal with Nordic countries aswell
3rd safest country in the world, progressive, good climate, infrastructure isn't bad
> noteworthy except size of paycheck
truly Slovenia and Portugal are brothers
I have a a black t-shirt that has written Ljubljana and has a dragon in it
Can you forgive me :(
There's a ton of fair criticisms of Portugal that every portuguese can agree on, but lowness of character
Meh, if you wanna leave your country cuz you selfishly decided you're not good enough to make it better then I agree, you helped solve the problem by leaving
Because Spain is culturally more significant by a huge margin

what do you see
Aren't the J proununced like i?

I seriously hate this northern "superiority". No I'm not jealous, it's just that you guys boast about stuff that isn't really fair to compare
Some countries didn't get rich based upon golden eggs they were sitting on
Your "riches" came by chance, otherwise you'd be a shitty county like any other frozen in it's irrelevance

Question, is this the LGBT-free zone of Poland
(if I'm not an idiot, I think I remember that there was a zone that the government declared as a zone in which there would only be straight people)
Edit: Hey, I wasn't sure there was a need to say this, but sure, any law/ruling that excludes LGBT people from any civil rights is absolutely BS, and not worthy of being followed
They should be punished as well with their houses burned too
Right wing and religion
It's so opposite to the old red communist image that russian spies are having a free reign field day on this one, even more than in the USA
Well, I'd like to be hopeful about your situation, but if memory serves me right you just had elections, and I'd bet the ruling party will make it as hard as possible to kick them out, so I can't see a path out that doesn't envolve a whole lot of disobedience
Got it, I was wondering if this was hate caused by these flags being in these ridiculous zones, but no, the hate is what caused the zones, not caused by
I've been ranting about this since the beginning of the year, even in Portugal is way too warm for this time of the year
I'm really worried for what this summer is going to be like, I guessing mass drought and scolding temperatures especially in the south
We're fucked
Never saw snow in my life, guess if things get any worse i will probably never will yekes
Every other day here has been basically summer and we're in the middle of winter
Well, we're fucked
There's nothing we can do really
"GloBaL WaRmiNg iSn'T rEaL"
We're gonna have to start reinventing proverbs like "abril, águas mil" and stuff like that
I propose "fevereiro debaixo do sobreiro" for February
As a fellow Portuguese, I don't think our "freezing" qualifies as cold in the rest of Europe
Freezing in Portugal (at least in the south) is temperatures of 15-10 degrees
Because this comes at a cost, these temperatures are an indication that the Southern European countries will suffer greatly (dryer weather, decrease of rain, worse fires, etc you know climate change)
Germany is doing long term shit now with the EU and global warming
Don't know what "south" you live in but in the Alentejo you get temps close to 0 often in the winter
Portimão. As south as you can go I guess
I know
And empathise with them because at the end of the day it's not a individual national problem but an international crisis that will affect mankind and will disproportionately affect countries with weak to average economic strength

I am here to say it is the commoner's responsibility that allows retarded ideas to be put into practice
We don't take the time to know Who these people are before they take office
More over, we keep voting out of ignorance for possibly another rather ignorant and insensitive person
It is the responsibility of the voter to know what is to be expected with their vote, not only by itself, but also globaly
We have to demand better politicians and we can only do it by knowing more
We have to demand ourselves to know more and respect what has been achieved throughout this millenia

I was there in February and i wish it had snow
Amazing
Expecting to visit again in the near future
Lisbon just woke up this morning to the first <15c morning
I've been in Prague three or four years ago in December's first week
Really loved the city, instantly became one of my favourites european capitals but I didn't got the full snow package
Now I want to complaint to someone
I'll be moving to Prague next month, just hope there will be snow then, I've never seen that much IRL
My Portuguese ass is going to freeze but I'm going to love it
Oh yes that's true
It's pretty to see when you're inside the house ahahah
100% worth the visit
[It does]
well that is a statesman
Good luck
I mean
what are we supposed to do about it
It's a totalitarian state, it's what's expected
Step 1) Transform into a Union of States
Step 2) Become as self-dependent as possible
Step 3) Along with any other democracies that want to go along with it, stop trading with authoritarian countries
That means China, Russia, maybe the US depending on how it runs itself
Well, russian meddling in the 2016 US election might have made democracy stronger in 2021

Instructions unclear, spent all the money in highways and German cars, now the train infrastructure is fucked
What do
Not relevant for me
Even high speed train, only Spain would be halfway at a comfortable time scale comparable to plane travelling
And for 5% of our population plane travel is absolutely essential, vital even
Trains are no replacement for plane travel for us
Well, the way things are going (plane tickets getting cheaper) I don't see how that will happen unless they COMPLETELY change the entire system because no one is going to pay more (and when I say more I mean a LOT more) to go by train and take 10x more time to reach the destination
I take the bus and the train every day within the country but the country is tiny and the tickets cheap but if I go somewhere else it's much cheaper and faster to take the plane
I for one see this as a good thing

Good Portugal and denmark
Good
After two survey :
Portugal : We want more European integration and fuck the US ! (and probably fuck Bolsonaro too if they asked)
I get that all of the last USA presidencies have been awful in so many ways, but the overall European "superior" attitude towards them is so elitist and smug that it just doesn't help towards unity between allies
If Europe ever gets invaded don't ask for the amercians help again
Late 2000s was probably when the shift started, after 9-11 most Europeans were in favor of helping the US in the Middle East but as the war continued and America's motives became more clear it was hard to stay on their side
Yep, plenty of people like Trump outside the US and firmly believe he's a great president
But they made it easier to spot who pays no attention to their own national politics and just watches right wing youtube videos
The only dichotomy in their head is liberal/left -- conservative/right
There are still people living like this today in certain parts of the world, not because there is not enough food, but because there are people at the top who wish it to be like that
Please do not forget them
And dont assume that just because it isn't happening to people who "look" like you, that it isn't important
EU just voted to have organizations who help refugees and migrants who die in the Mediterranean to be able to be criminalized
It is now a crime to help these people
The far right celebrated this in the eu assembly
Yeah, good news
Best of luck
Let's see what this leads to, hopefully not another dictator or a power vacuum
It has begun
Ah, that one
After a little shallow digging, found out that it's organized by right wing extremists
Just check their profiles and see what kind of pages they Like: Escudo Identitário, Chega, PNR, the whole lot
There are people really willing to seed chaos, so they can harvest something from it
And it's not necessarily the same thing we seek for

Macron is a very good president with very high approval ratings, and wasn't at all elected to prevent the fascist from gaining power
I mean the guys who created the event
I have friends sharing it who are proper left wing, without even releasing what they going for
>who is doing what he promised to do
What
The protests are not about that
My dude, nothing you say changes the fact that the people screaming Russia at any point in time really need a scapegoat for their actions
Russia isn't the problem, neoliberalism is
People are sick of politicians sucking up to the big guys, so of course they're gonna break shit
Maybe division and chaos is what's missing when a democratically elected leader constantly screws over their constituency
Yes, outside of Portugal that might be true
Here, not so much
For the good or the worst, PCP controls the street movements and they’re in bed with the government
All these strikes are just a proof of life, and trying to take away the majority from PS in next year’s elections
16 journalists is 16 too many
To me those guys from catalunya might qualify as well
They were setenced because of political reasons
crimes of sedition
are those not political
I don't care if catalunya stays a part of spain or not
Sedition laws exist to maintain the status quo
My point is that these crimes are political in nature
> Anything can be political under the right circumstances, even having an abortion
Don't deflect
Sedition crimes are always political in nature
No need for a special context

> How does it relate to the map though

After so many posts about senators in the US,
finally a lot of EU redditors have their say, US politicians should look more to Europe

It might be just a show rn, but it gives strenght to the movement, which might one day transform into something greater
This does not apply to Lisbon in many, many ways
Doesn't apply to Lisbon for sure
Doesn't really apply for Portugal
Jokes on you, our Avenue is a WW**I** Memorial
LOL, not mine
That's because Tejo is too large
Porto on the other hand
We don't have a WW II avenue
I specified Lisbon didn't I? And the title specifies capitals, which Porto is not
Also, most bars in Porto are also on the north side in Ribeira
On the other hand we may have something about the WW I or Colonial War in our cities
Oh yeah
What Riverside bars do you have on the south side of Tejo
Chill dude, I was just trying to say that, while it doesn't apply to every city, it applies to a lot of them
And obviously it's not exactly like in the map, maybe like 70%. And no, it doesn't specify capitals
Dude, it's just a cartoon

Why is this posted in Europe
Trump goes down as the most insane president I ever seen, and this included a lot of dictators, they are usually ruteless but not this insane
The comedy aspect will be missed
It's a small relief, although it looks like interesting scenes will still come between now and the inauguration
Nonetheless, Europe has an opportunity here to grow it's image
I'm tired of seeing top talent leaving to the US preaching freedom and "the greatest democracy in the world" where nearly half of the votes practically don't count and a presidential candidate with 3% or 4 million more votes is quite close of not being elected, and only called 4 days after the elections
Don't get me started on all the bipartisanship, gerrymandering and all the sneaky political shananigans
(Not saying we don't have our problems)
haha
nice analogy
He has more than 4 million votes than Trump on the popular vote alone, and will probably have over 300 electoral votes, not that thinny
Tiny was Bush v Gore in 2000
This is why I'm so happy
I wish we didn't have to care about the US elections (specially when so many Europeans don't really care about our own systems and European elections) but the truth is that culturally it carries great importance into our borders
Trump was the fire stoking all of the far right rising we've been seeing
They were always here, but never as confident to show their ugly heads
Hopefully things will be able to improve now
But not by themselves, we still need to actively fight these fuckers
We were all thinking it
He has immense political experience and history to back him up as someone who has amazing negotiation skills with him opponents and a deep understanding of minority social issues
I can't stand when people just call him a traditional white old man politician
He is a lot more than that
That is a dumb reason
This is not Europe related, this sub should focus more on european information
People are more interested in this than in the corruption, security issues and other european problems

What is actually happening in belarus
What is the problem
I have been distancing myself from news so I don't really know what's happening
Wait but didn't Lukashenko win with 80%?
No no they where all brought in from Western Europe to protest, like 50 thousand people just arrived out of nowhere in Belarus

Our forest is fake
it's basically plantations of eucaliptus and pine trees to be turned into paper
Our native forest is gone as long with animals that lived there exept in very few natural reserves
No wonder we have huge fires every few years (and more eucaliptus are planted back afterwards)
Damn it's actually impressive to me how wrong our perception is
I've been all over most of those countries and seeing those 30 something % on Luxembourg (around the same as most of the other countries around) made me go "that can't be right", because if you travel around Luxembourg there's forest everywhere, hell the area of the capital city is around 20% forest and driving on the national routes (not highways) between population centers is always done though thick forests
I would have totally said it was like 60% at least
But yeah, that's why we need factual data
Reading the comments from people of places with high percentages is  making me uneasy
There's a tingling in my butt
I want out of here
Unfortunately my country burns up every summer
Our forest is a sham
Plantations of fast growing eucaliptus only useful to make paper
No animals can live there
Maybe Koalas could
Eucalyptus grows back fast
No, now bugger off to your sub
Imagine defending vandalism
Change those colors to any other and no one bats an eye
I really dont understand the obsession of putting the LGBT flag everywhere
It does nothing of value and only creates the idea that LGBT are a bunch of fanatics going around putting flags like any other low level vandalism
I thought the idea was to be seen as equal to other citizens
Maybe I'm stupid and the way forward truly is to antagonize a country thats not really into you even more
Poland called Lgbt people inhumane and there were violent protests against lgbt people
Drawing rainbows in the streets doesn't seem that bad compared to what Poland is doing with them

Ironic of Portugal to think the US is broken, while we keep getting to the worst place among Europe
I'd love to know the ages of people who participated because I don't know a lot of olders folks outside of academia in Portugal who understand the American political system, let alone be able to judge it
How the fuck does it not work
Portugal :D
This life expectancy graph according to wealth explains it:
Where does the money go, US
It's telling when the only two countries who give a somewhat positive rating to the US political system are Hungary and Poland, the two EU countries that take undemocratic actions and who blackmailed the EU over rule of law
This isn’t referring to what people vote on, but to the political system itself
In fact, if people want to vote conservative, they should be able to, and their vote should count
Thing is, I don't see the Dems being unreasonable, they seem willing to compromise (within limits), while Republicans seem to disregard their own ideology (i.e. they weren't opposition, they are contrarians) and as example, they declined to confirm judge Garland back in 2016 saying Obama was in the lame duck period, and Lindsey Graham even said he would do the same if in 4 years there was a Republican sitting president and a new supreme judge vacancy open up
Lo and behold, 4 years later they do have a new nomination for a judge in the supreme court, with a Republican sitting president, and now he isn't a lame duck anymore
Another example, debt and being fiscal responsible
They berated Obama's expenditure, and then went and indebted US more than ever before, while making the US less capable of paying such debt with their fiscal policies
So sure, it is polarized but it's because the Republicans became a caricature of themselves and don't stand for anything anymore
Their unofficial motto became: we're not the Dems
and we're not GOP either

This phenomena is aptly called (the science of) Dehumanization  this is exactly what  the Nazis did, as the article explains, plenty more and its a long tradition in human history, even before they had a name for it
This is evil and messed up
From another article,  "Two forms of experienced dehumanization were apparent
In one, a failure to recognize the target's equal status is associated with aversive self-awareness and feelings of shame and guilt
In the other, a failure to recognize the target's basic existence as a person is associated with cognitive deconstructive states and feelings of sadness and anger

The Portuguese one, that usually gets around 5-10%, defends North Korea and other communist dictatorships
While currently they're more about party guided syndicalism and hard socialism you can be sure they would go back to their communist roots if they had enough votes
Fortunately younger people don't vote for them and they mostly get their votes from the older people in the southern rural areas
So the party will probably be reduced to insignificance in a few decades
Our Prime-Minister is fearmongering about a "impasse à espanhola" (translation not needed I think), if BE (left-wing party like Podemos) gains too much power in the next election
This is why that's not really a concern
The problem isn't that Podemos has too much power, it's that in Spain there isn't yet a culture of coalition building among the political parties, while in Portugal coalition governments (or pacts to support the government as of right now) are not unusual
Nice

Greece surrendered to Germany in WW2 but refused to surrender to Italy because Greece humiliated them
EDIT: For more context, Greece's military was small compared to Italy's and Mussolini thought it would be an easy conquest
Not only did his invasion fail, Greece was actively winning while outnumbered, humiliating them
In the end, Germany had to come and win the war for them and Greece only surrendered to Germany
Mussolini was so bad at war it's astounding
He made the trains run on time and the military really inefficient and badly supplied
Clearly the problem lies with the faces
Bodies are on point though

Brits use the fascists when necessary (Farage being an example) but they actually don't give them power, with guys like Farage and Rees-Mogg, who are right-wing hardliners actually being insulted quite often
Same reason why Corbyn was never going to be elected, Brits have a hard time with hardliners
Boris, May and Cameron were all conservatives but none of them were hardliners, two of them were pro-EU and the other supported abortion and gay marriage

I was in the break room with 2 colleagues when Jobs walked in and started making a bagel
We were sitting at a table eating ours when he out of the blue asked us "Who is the most powerful person in the world
"  I said Mandela since I had just been there as an international observer for the elections
In his confident fashion he stated "NO
you are all wrong
the most powerful person in the world is the story teller
" At this point I was thinking to myself "Steve, I love you but there is a fine line between genius and loco
and I think I am witnessing this right now". Steve continued, "The storyteller sets the vision, values and agenda of an entire generation that is to come and Disney has a monopoly on the storyteller business
You know what
I am tired of that bullshit, I am going to be the next storyteller"  and he walked out with his bagel

Sry, basicaly what was 50 escudos became 50 cents of the new euro, equivalent to 100 escudos, exactly the double
1euro = 200 escudos
1st January 2001
1 Deutsche Mark = 1 Euro,
1 Euro = 200 Escudos (previous portuguese currency),
1 coffee 50 Escudos = 0
50 Euro ?????? ,
But yeah, literally prices mostly doubled overnight on everyday stuff in Portugal when we adopted the Euro

After eating these  "Berliner" all over europe I have to say the pączek Polish version is so far the worse of them
I got to try their many flavours of fillings, from famous bakeries, but was always left disapointed as they were all pretty bad (like just poor tasting chocolate fillings or a synthetic/fake strawberry jam taste)
The best ones are found in Portugal "Bolas de Berlim" with the filling of "creme pasteleiro", they are like a massive step above in the tier of berliners
That looks weirdly like a Berlin ball, a portuguese sweet
And i'm not sure when we celebrate Fat Tuesday

I think there is a mistake
Portuguese people don't kill other people
I believe I can explain the situation
It is a translation mistake meaning people were searching "como matar sem ser apanhado" which it can also be translated as "How to get away with murder" the series, it was popular in 2016
Don't worry we aint weird

Climate change: this ain't even my final form
I mean
I would actually appreciate a bit of heat over here (north of Portugal) - weather hasn't gone anywhere upwards of 25º. It's fucking end of July and I'm still leaving in the morning with a pair of jeans and a jacket
Summer has not started over here lol
Its raining where im at
Should be a lot worst
So ppl can take climate change seriously
Portugal good
Once again, another heat wave that doesn't mess with Portugal
As a Portuguese living in Glasgow
This kinda feels like home
IT'S A LIE
Aaah you northerners and your low heat tolerance
*Laughs in high temperatures*

>Folks, dehydration is no joke
dehydration is not the only problem strong heat can cause
I think people who are not used to the heat can be a bit too wishful thinking that drinking water or using sunscreen is enough
dehydration is not the only problem cause by the sun
You can drink lots of water and still suffer heat stroke
The best, foremost advice is to respect the heat, and change routine as necessary, to protect oneself
Do not exert yourself needlessly (sports, or working outside
if working conditions are unbearable
Drinking water, and upping mineral consumotion (sports drinks, salty food, and supplements) helps but it is stupid to drinking water a is a magical shield against the heat
it is not, you can overheat, you get exhausted very fast, you can loose the ability to regulate temperature
Most private homes in Portugal don't have AC either
Idk why suddenly no one realizes that and thinks this is relevant *now*
What do you say about Christmas in the beach
It would be relevant if it was Winter season
But hey, every year, same old shit
I suppose people were slow with realizing what's climate change and now they are lost
Completly lost, lol

Removing space from cars and not having an real alternative is not a good thing
FYI catching 2-3 public transports and wasting the more time on them is not an alternative
Just as the rest of Europe
but hey
it's a sidewalk that will be barely used
They did the same with bike lanes in Lisbon, for over a year I saw less than 50 People in total using them
Cars are not the enemy
Poor infrastructure is the problem
That's great and all but it's a pain for car users as they will have to park further away from their homes
I feel like there'd be less complaints if there were viable alternatives
For instance my town in Portugal is doing this kind of renewal to move cars away from the city
But at the same time, there are less bus routes than 20 years ago (and population is going up, not down, so it's not like it's a desertifying zone), and public transport inside the town is a joke
In big cities with developed or developing public transport networks these kind of changes make perfect sense, but it's not a one size fits all kind of solution

How the people in France arent up in arms with this government is beyond me, though it explains the state of the EU in many ways
France seems to be the center of these attacks now
I've been saying it for years, religions are the most idiotic, stupid, useless thing mankind has ever created
And no, you don't get to say yours is better, Catholics burned people, started the crusades to kill the infidels at the behest of the Pope and financed by the Church
So much suffering and deaths for imaginary friends someone made up to control the masses
I just hope they only killed and made wars among themselves
Downvote me i don't care
here we go again
The problem is clear but no one will do anything about it
Stay strong, you have an amazing country
France is EU's beacon regarding freedom
*Europe
Caling for genocide isn't cute, you child
Ban Islam
Equate it to problem ideologies like Nazism, Anarchism and Communism
It is a first step for truly tackling the issue
I really shouldn't get more into this
But hatred generated hatred
I care as much about who started it as with 2 small kids fighting
And what about the church telling people not to hear condoms in Africa and aids exploded
What about the same sex weddings
Seriously I don't care, I couldn't care less about religion any religion
Most just cause hatred, misery, wars, suffering
So discussing one or another is not my point
We're not evolving
> Latin
That's why I corrected you, you posted cringe
>All I said was that Islamist should feel the fury of Europe
Riiiiiiight
The example relates to all this mess started
Or started even further back idk or care
The problem is religion, 2 idiots believing in different imaginary friends
Out of the loop in here, why do they call him "cube"?
I'm pro EU but
This gives propaganda-ish vibes

"Hi, I'm an American
I think that suffices, although I do agree with you
you need to take a step back
What’s Lithuania  doing there then
Oh, yeah I didn't think that
I was just pointing out that the shorthand kind of exists already, and most people aren't really prone to confusion and know the subtext I suppose
Although I just find it annoying if nothing else
And there is barely an acceptable word to describe "Americans" or united stadiens of america
Now we are left with a word that means someone from anywhere south to north
Although I think people get the shorthand and don't conflate the two :)
Portugal's the one on the Mother's lap to the left
FINNS - congratulations for your bravery and resistance
You've successfully battled your worse enemies, the weather, the cold, the dark and unforgiving land, the endless nights, the epic booze-ups
With what you endure year after year, keeping the russians at bay is almost a footnote
Not as many perkeles as there should be, though
Just saying
Mika Häkkinen slacked off hard
Very beautiful indeed
Can't wait to see what communist America does in the near future
Good grief

Maybe there's some joke I don't get, but wouldn't he be explaining how to rush A (Russia) instead
That reminded me of all the Hitler jokes we have around here
Hitler is usually accompanied by a sidekick named Hans and enjoys chatting with jews at concentration camps

I do believe the arc of history bends toward justice

Imagine Europe being lead by either fascists or dreamy liberals that want to increase debts

Not to worry, in Lisbon city center they added asphalt on top of the cobblestone, after some years of rain and trucks going by now the previously covered cobblestone is showing, leaving potholes everywhere

Anyone can be friendly

How is it like living in Russia
Are you constantly bombarded with government propaganda
And does anything happen if you speak out against your government's actions, be it in personal conversations or in the press/online
Sorry if these are stupid questions, I'm just curious
That's ok
I already got the answers I was looking for
Old coin though
The UK shouldn't be on the original euro coin then

I stand corrected

reminder that tibet was literally a slave society before china took over, hong kong was stolen from china by the british after a war in which the british literally forces the chinese to be addicted to opium, and tiananmen was done by maoist protesters who were against the capitalist reforms of deng xiaoping

Yes, but can I have the less corrupt and less federal version
Do you have it in white as well
I want it to go back to what it used to be, free movement, free trade, not a giant superstate that I have barely a vote in
Actually Eu in Portuguese means "Me".
Uhhh
The problem, in my opinion, is the price
300 Euros without any games is too much for me :(

Is this something that occurs yearly on some days or is this just another consequence of climate Change
yeah, no way this cold rainy winter go away
it's 18ºC right now here
These maps are really misleading
The map was at 10 UTC which was well 10 am for us, but solar noon or past it, so closer to their daily max temperature in lots of places east

What different opinions have people in Russia about him ? He is not consensual as a rising star against Putin ?
He's a right wing nationalist but far better when it comes to free speech/democracy stuff than Putin
Obviously he is not unanimously popular
I mean he has a very good amount of followers on social networks such as Twitter and YouTube it's the best modern way to make opposition
I truly thought he was "the man that Putin feared the most" like a read in an article some time ago
In many ways its healthy being this way

A lot of European countries have a problem similar to the one happening in the US, whereas not many countries risk a foreign invasion (the closest is Ukraine and nobody seems to really care anymore)
Remember one thing
It's much easier to defend the ones that are like western's than the ones who the opposite party, let's say afd, can say that are "dangerous Muslims ". Sorry for terrible english
Police brutality isn't just people killed by the police
They put them up in Lisbon also where large drunk crowds are expected
However why dont they place them in corners, they place them in the open its so awkward having a piss and everyone passing by

Hey look its the daily the democratic elected president of Poland is a clown thread
Are you expecting the left to handle actual real social issues that affect the majority of the population
Calm down there that might make them win elections
Things like this makes me want to believe hell is real
Portugal does not need any extra requirements, we were doing quite well and improving our situation pre covid, we were slowly improving from a financial crisis that was not our fault but still exploded our country because we were left alone by the EU
If that happened again we would be completely fucked, we lost 10%+ of GDP in a couple of months from something totally outside of our control, we just need help getting to the other side of it and not be abandoned again, after that if we keep going at the same pace as before covid we will keep slowly improving our fiscal and economical situation
we will let slide your children coming to portugal and spreading disease and chaos like they have been since the start of summer
when you start taxing foreign corps higher as they should, maybe we'll respect you more
Finally
The perfect example that shows that immigration policy matters
Good on Poland dont fall into this trap
You can take them from the empire but can't take the empire from them
Ok just cut the country in half already

We also use the Greek expression in Portugal "Isso para mim é grego
" Although less commonly nowadays
Me, a railway enthusiast: I'm moving to Germany with immediate effect
Yap, even at [OPs source] it has both "This is Chinese to me" and "This is Greek to me" for Portugal
atleast he didn't say it sounded Spanish :)

Can someone compile a list of who were the fuckers who approved this
I want them jobless after the next elections
And the vote was forced by UKIP and other MEPS using the rules of procedures otherwise it would have gone through on the nod last year
Remember that
Once the UK is out, you won't even hear about these changes
To the surprise of no one
All bought and paid for
Really
I have
They aren't they are just corrupted
And you just know that our government is gonna implement the worst possible version of the directive given how shitty they are
Going to be impossible to browse the web in Portugal without VPN and even then
Here's a short summary of what protesting achieves:
fuckall
I understand how the EU works
Unelected officials proposed the laws
Elected officials vote on if the law should pass or not
You have no controll over it since when you voted you had no idea what was their stance on an issue that didn't exist yet
True, this will be disastrous, and I don't think our government will try to stop it at all
I'm not sure of the results this time around
But I do know that only two Portuguese MEPs had voted against the directive before this stage, which is shameful
Marisa Matias (BE) and Francisco Assis (PS)
Assis' position is particularly brave because he was the only MEP to oppose the directive in his own (Portuguese) party
Marisa Matias I'm absolutely certain that voted against, because she had pledged to do it and actively campaigned against this bullshit directive
News flash - The actual United Kingdom is not the entity typing on this account
Oh yeah I forgot about that but you know what VPNs say: This is America

Hate to be that guy but technically you can't be in contravention of a provision about *definitions
* Perhaps article 6 or the one about profiling is more appropriate, maybe check with the Lapland supervisory authority
Consent needs to be specific and mustn't be assumed
In essence you'd have to state in your letter to Santa that you allow your personal data to be collected, processed, plus Santa would need to inform you about your rights, his purpose for processing data, his identity, etc
Therefore the lack of consent would need another legitimate ground for processing, like the contract basis or Article 6 (f) for legitimate interests of Santa
He certainly needs to clarify if the profiling amounts to automated decision-making
E.g. is it made through Christmas magic/algorithms, are there deep-learning elves involved
Additionally, Santa's main public is made of children under 16, who have an extra layer of protection in certain aspects
Get your things together, Santa
When I was in Madrid, a local told me: what you'll see in every street is both a peluqueria and a place with jamon

Finally Portugal not being Baltic
It's not gay, it's same sex marriage
Us bisexuals are part of it too
In any case, i thought Germany did NOT have same-sex marriage
Does anybody know current gay divorce rates
Portugal has an history of being fairly progressive when it comes to LGBT rights
We were the eight in the world to recognize same-sex marriage and we're one of the very few countries to recognise a non-binary/third gender
We also recently allowed same-sex adoption and medically assisted reproduction for same-sex couples
When you take into consideration other things such as our stance with drugs and (hopefully soon) euthanasia, I think it's fair to say that Portugal is one of the most progressive countries when it comes to social issues
FYI portugal was the first country in the world to abolish the death penalty and the second in the world to abolish slavery
We just passed euthanasia
We were among the first countries in the world to pass same sex civil unions and then same sex marriage
We are an example on decriminalization of drugs
Portugal has always been at the vanguard of human rights
I don't understand how you can even think something less so, much less the opposite
There is more salt in the Mediterranean though
Only 19 for opp-sex
I thought it was much higher
Wondering whether compatibility in same-sex marriages ended up being better
I mean after all that struggle to marry, if everybody started divorcing it'd be a shame

23°C in Porto
I'm currently wearing a coat
Edit: Weather alert
It is now 27 °C, I  have taken off my coat
Why did you brake your pen
Sunday is going to be 38 is Madrid and Berlin, and just 22 here in Porto
the Atlantic Ocean is depressed, even here in Lisbon we had lower than usual temperatures, and
water
that fell from the sky a few days back, go figure
But all is OK from tomorrow onwards it's back to business as usual, drought and 35°C and more
Edit: close all windows and shades during day, open everything at night stay in the dark and hydrate
Good luck
That moment when all of Europe is melting and we are complaining that it's too cold
You should have come to Portugal, then
People are still wearing coats here
21°C is completely bearable
I feel you
That's our average spring day
I'm cold
and it's a spring coat, it's not very thick
Oh my sweet Winter child
I'm wearing a coat right now
Yes, and probably for a big part of europeans tbf
It must be bad for those who love far up in the north ofcourse
Pretty much, yes
It's 23 °C here
With 19 °C I would be wearing pants, a coat and a long sleeve shirt
That's our average spring day
I had to work in a office with 40 °C because the AC was broken, now that is hell
On the other hand, we're not used to the cold
With negative temperatures, we won't even leave the house

Never seen this one, pretty good, thanks
Gonna have to try your luck somewhere else though, people here only know to bomb Jihadists far far away

> The rioting was sparked by allegations of sexual assault on Han women by Uyghurs, and rumours of an incident in which two female Han workers were sexually assaulted by six Uyghur co-workers at the factory, according to Voice of America

China imposed child limits within it's own majority ethnicity and minorities were exempted from the One-Child policy for many years
> The policy also allowed exceptions for some other groups, including ethnic minorities
Thus, the term "one-child policy" has been called a "misnomer", because for nearly 30 of the 36 years that it existed (1979–2015), about half of all parents in China were allowed to have a second child
Also try to not base your opinion on the "research" of someone that considers himself in a mission led by God against China, that calls gender equality, homosexuality and bans on corporal punishment the Antichrist and is an advisor at a Theology college
Usually not a great idea
> Zenz is a born-again Christian
He stated that he feels "led by God" in his mission
> With Marlon S. Sias, Zenz co-authored the book Worthy to Escape: Why All Believers Will Not Be Raptured Before the Tribulation which links modern trends, including gender equality, homosexuality and bans on corporal punishment, to the power of the Antichrist
It's the Falun Gong all over again
A bunch of homophobic, sexist nutjobs that believe that aliens rule the world, who run propaganda campaigns through their media outlets, yet the moment they claimed "China is stealing organs" no one doubted of their claims
The most ironic part is that some Uyghur separatist movements have been labelled as terrorist groups by the United Nations and U.S. Department of State (since they have a history of terrorist attacks in chinese soil), but people act that the chinese government picks minorities at random to oppress
I did Syria
Always liked this flag
And apparently that's what the flag is supposed to symbolise
What did i expected
What the hell is a mink farm
What do you get

That hit me in the feels
You warned us all, Italy
How about less symbolic bullshit and more actual recompensation thought work rights and higher salaries and better contracts
Abortion is not a right

Ah yes, we call that the April 25th special over here
Not to take away from the message, but are the EU contribution amounts adjusted for inflation
You can't put a price on xenophobia can you
wtf poland
Wtf Poland
Portugal is an hilarious roller coaster
Yh kinda surprising, i thought you guys were better than Portugal in terms of renewable energy
Not really
Their share should be higher, but the high population density and land flatness doesn't help
Offshore wind is an option but they are just next to some of the busiest maritime lanes in the world, so it's also limited
Either way, they can and should improve
Why not solar or wind
The EU isn't the world police
Belarus isn't even a member lol
I'm half-Scottish and usually go there at least once a year for a couple of weeks to see my mum's side of the family
One thing I always found shocking was the incredible amount of sweets, crisps and snacks in supermarkets
When I was a kid I loved it, but nowadays I think it's crazy
Having spent last year living in Scotland I also noticed just how bad a lot of people's eating habits are over there
~~Portugal~~ Spain can into Eastern Europe
They eat reasonable, small portions, and varied food
I think it is not so much what you eat, but how much you eat
Also they drink moderately, and beer bellies are not a stereotype without good reason
The things is Italians probably don't drink 1L of coke each meal and they usually eat smaller portions with salads and have a more balanced diet
Their traditional desserts are very very rich in sugar, and oil
They use a lot of fats in cooking as well
Also and I think this always the most important factor, portion size
If you eat lots of healthy natural food, you will still get fat
If you eat little of unhealthy food, you might not be healthy but likely you will be thin
Such an underated comment ahahahha
What about all those flavored pellegrinos
Those have a ton of sugar
Idk how popular they are over there though but the Italian restaurant I used to go to (tons of immigrants there), id see them knocking those back all the time
All I'm saying is that I noticed a lot of empty cans of Irn-Bru lying about the streets
But I actually fell into some bad habits myself
There was many a time I'd get the Tesco meal deal for 3£ and get a Monster as my drink, not because I wanted or needed it, but because it was such a steal
Definitely put on a little weight last year
Been there three times and I agree
But I was more surprised at the types of medicine they sold in drug stores
That's why exchange of cultures is so important
You guys pick up the original recipe of Italians and perfected it with the Peepza
Im the only one who thought this was a dick joke
Better than the abortion that Norman Foster shared
You do understand that it was a joke right
If Norman Foster makes a proposal I think it's going to be bolder than just changing the burnt sections with glass
And do you have any serious source for this
Because an unsourced image from a tweet doesn't look official
I'm gonna share some personal experience to give some perspective
A few months ago I got curious about this very topic on the lines of "how can someone believe this
" and did some research on what kind of arguments were used to deny the holocaust
I was expecting some weird lunacy conspiracy yet I was surprised with how compelling some of the arguments were
For example, one used was "All the death camps were liberated by the soviets so much of the initial info comes from the USSR
Do you trust the USSR
" among other such as historical documents/testimonies that go against the "official" version or questioning the logistics of how the millions of bodies were disposed of
These were surprisingly effective at raising doubts about certain aspects of the holocaust
The real issue that I found it that if start questioning some facts (which even I did) it is really hard to actually get answers to those questions
Even if you start questioning in 100% good faith just to fact check you will easily be labelled as a stupid nazi denier
I'm not a denier, the holocaust happened and there is ample evidence of a genocide effort on behalf of the nazis against the jewish communities (among others) of Europe
However, I think there is some public shaming about questioning some facts and logistics around it that actually help grow the number of holocaust deniers
Just my 2 cents on the issue that I thought would contribute to the discussion
I hate it here on earth
Wow really what the fuck
Far-right resurgence
The big one was that all the extermination camps being liberated by the Soviets put the info around them into question
I'm not 100% sure on this so correct me but for the first year after liberation do we have info about these camps from a non soviet source
This was doubly weird for me since I know of some massacres that the soviets tried to pin on the nazis such as the mass shooting of polish officers
I didn't start to question whether the camps existed
They were there and had the specific purpose of extermination but I started wondering if some details were exaggerated by the soviets or not
That was the main one to me at least but I probably should research the topic a bit more to come to more accurate conclusions
Assuming they did a good job at picking people
That's very cool
I don't really know how it works but it's interesting
I guess choosing randomly is not so simple though
At least in my head
If they choose 1000 random people in Milan for example it's not going to be representative of the whole Italy
And maybe even in Milan they happened to choose "randomly" people near an area of a certain demography, the results might not even represent Milan
As a portuguese i find this weird, if it is below 30° it's a bad beach day ahaha
Ironically, here in the south is colder than usually
GIVE US OUR WARMTH BACK
IS THE ONLY THING WE HAVE !
Wait
28 is too hot
What temperatures do you get in the summer
Still fresh spring here, wtf
Gib summer, Finland, you can handle the cold
18c here
Going to Finland next month, i hope the heat keeps building up
How are your beaches
Portuguese here, i use t shirts only, only if temeperature is above 24/25 degrees
The cold temeperatures aren't that big of a deal, you can always wear more jackets lol
Did you die from hypothermia
Nordic countries are not used to hot climates so 28°C is a lot for them
Where are you going
Lisbon
If yes its always around 35°C more or less
It's hot, but not that much when compared to other places
Also, the fact that you have 15 degrees in summer blows my mind, like
Do you even go to the beach
28-30 degrees is a heat wave
What
Weather has been crazy
We had a couple of days some weeks ago where the temperature reached 25 but it has been rainy and cloudy ever since, though I think they are starting to go up now
We've been getting around 20 degrees in my city and we call that cold, especially of you go out
What temperatures do you get in the winter
I sure am
Idanha à Nova, near my "roots", ay
Gets extremely hot in the summer, and rather cold in the winter
The average peak day is like 41/42, but expect at least 35C. Have fun
Wow idanha a nova is extremely hot in the summer you are gonna melt ahahah
Its 25 degrees today and i am still wearing a jacket xD i dont know how you do that
I know, it's just weird to think about it because I've never been in contact with that  kind of thing
I was thinking it would be lower, because of all the snow and stuff
The shortest international bridge in the world

Saw it on the news yesterday
Don't know their sources
But I do imagine borders are all well documented and categorized
It's [3,2 meters] long
If you're talking about [this one] it looks about 3 times longer
**shakes fist in portuguese* *
Where exactly is it
TBH, the drama has all been coming from people who don't know shit about nuclear and just whine "muh radiatshon". If you dump radioactive waste on the bottom of a pool you can swim in it and be fine, so long you don't come within 1-2 meters of the bottom of the pool
I'd rather the spanish bury nuclear residue close to our border than dump an equivalent amount of CO2 into the atmosphere
That being said, I don't know how versed are the Spanish in infrastructural safety
* Oliven**ç**a
The issue isn't that the deposit is going to cause issues
The problem is that the nuclear power plant that creates the waste that gets deposited there is old and has safety issues, and that by creating this deposit they will use it as an excuse to keep it in operation far into the future
Then why don't the Spanish dump that shit in the middle of their country
Portugal doesn't use nuclear energy and shouldn't be punished if the Spanish have a problem with their nuclear energy
Because
1) Spain can bury whatever the fuck they want in their territory, even if it's 1km from the Border and isn't anything illegal
2) The guy above just explained if stored properly Nuclear waste isn't detrimental to human health, which the spaniards were more than happy to comply with the Portuguese requirements
This kind of decision isn't made like Zé of the Tasca, it probably goes more deep and has more variables to it than "VAMONOS JODER LOS PORTUGUESES JEJEJEJE"  or "ENTAO METAM LA NA TERRA DELES PÁ"
Nah it isn't detrimental to human health, that's why there are so many people living in Fukushima/Chernobyl right
Reddit has a huge boner for nuclear energy but doesn't realize that it is dangerous
if you lived near the border would you like to know that there is a nuclear waste dump outside of your house
Would you like to know that there is a nuclear powerplant running for 20 years more than what was planned to do
And he didn't explain shit he said, didn't explain

But until now it's much better then the trio of complete idiots, trump, putin and Boris
In almost every country, the current government always tries to keep the last government's commitments in terms of foreign policy, even if they would have done differently
In my country the two biggest parties agree almost completely on foreign policy, so it's not even an issue
In the US, the current administration actively works to destroy everything the last one has achieved
And it's likely the next one will do the same to this one
And it also clearly shows that the untrustworthiness of the USA is due to Trump
And that Boris Johnson dropped UK's.
Ya okay NL
maybe stop being a tax shelter for US tech  companies
Google funneled 125 billion through your country and gave you 25m in taxes
Absolutely disgraceful
An Ajax footballer pays more in taxes
Shame shame shame
Edit:  From the article: " Over a period of eight years, internet giant Google funneled 128 billion euros through a Dutch subsidiary to tax haven Bermuda
This yielded over 25 million euros to the Dutch Tax Authority in the period between 2012 and 2019, NOS reports based on annual reports of the Dutch subsidiary - Google Netherlands Holdings B.V. - and figures from the Dutch Chamber of Commerce

Its a win for them

YouTube has several copyright options even with copyright claims
The owner can just claim as revenue to request removal
This mean that all ad revenue could go to Sony for all those uploads

All this post-brexit freedom is lifting us higher and higher
But wait
what is this humidity I feel
(dissolves into rain)
At this point brexit is more than annoying
Yes I do support what this woman said and fully believe that what the UK is doing is stupid, and that the tactics use in the referendum were at best in bad faith and at worst lying propaganda that should have never happened
Has fellow European and Portuguese and a law student i must say this just get this shit show over, be it cancelling of brexit or a brexit actually happening, and UK citizens don't desperate if brexit happens because the Lisbon treatie doesn't forbids ex members from joining the EU so think very well in the next election if brexit does happen because this show could be stop from continuing to exist and stop some of the damage already done by then, don't vote with your ideology in mind but with your brain for the best solution
Man I feel bad for the Scotts, they never asked for this
Do the right thing and have another referendum for fucks sake
I would vote for her
leave wouldn't win if everyone had all the facts :)
It wouldn't be the same vote though, it wouldn't just be leave or stay, it would be this deal or stay, now that people how the country can actually leave, all the things that will change they have the right to decide since they were told something very different
> Who says that
Anyone with two brain cells
> The deal was already rejected
by the UK parliment, if they are pressured by the people to accept, they will, the EU will accept it
> Slovenians were told something very different, you dont see us moning about redoing the Yugoslavia referendum
Ok, cool, you do understand that one of those has already been implemented and the other hasn't right
May presented her deal three times, it's not that much of an issue plus art
50 can be revoked if they wish
Ok, but that's also why a second refferendum is important
If the people vote in favor of this deal, any polititian who then votes against it in Parliment commits pollitical suicide
Article 50 wasn't voted in parliment, you might be thinking of the House of Lords
Ok, I'm not gonna deny that, I don't remember, it's been a while, I still doubt most politicians would go against the will of the people
Oh, I wouldn't say that
Can think of a few examples that prove Russians are quite capable changing things when they really want/have to
What is the source for the 6
6 million from China
> Much like Italy, Austria, and every EU and NATO member state to their east, Serbia is part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative
While the Chinese are economically active in Serbia, their investments are, in reality, mostly loans and remain clustered around several specific projects
Of the $2
2 billion that has entered Serbia from China, almost two-thirds are loans and only one-fourth, or $561 million, actual investments
This image is comparing apples to oranges
It's comparing what people see as foreign investments ("aid") to actual aid in economic terms
Hence why Serbians see China and Russia as giving the most "aid" in the form of investments while neither of them are on the economical aid side
And considering China has loaned/invested 2
2 billion in Serbia and the EU 1
819 billion the percentages make much more sense
A sub always praising to be against propaganda and immune to it falls for RadioFreeEurope and RadioLiberty which are news agencies funded by the US Government

Because being surrounded by healthy economies improves the EU's economy as well

Tourism can be both good and bad
It helps bring in money, but can also end up shaping a place until it becomes dependant on it
But even for places that rely on tourism overtourism can be a problem, as it can put pressure on infrastructure, lead to an increase in litter and pollution, drive property prices up, etc
You shouldn't feel bad in being a tourist
A lot of us enjoy travelling and visiting new places
But it's important to be a responsible tourist
Do some research on the place you plan on visiting, see to it that you aren't contributing to any of the problems that arise from tourism there
And also shop local
It's important to help local businesses and services, as that way you're ensuring money goes to the residents of those places
There should be a subreddit for people that get the Portuguese flag right

Portugal is just a fusion between the Mediterranean and Eastern Europe at this point

Well, the economic and social indicator maps are similar because Portugal is less developed than its closest neighbors, so it's not a coincidence more than it is a consequence of a lack of development
Everything else is probably a huge coincidence, including the phonology of the languages being similar and the fact that we say rabbits in this case
The "tea" map is definitely a coincidence, since Slavic countries say the word from Iranian influence and Portuguese say the word from Cantonese influence because we went directly to the source
It just so happens that Iranians probably got their word for tea from the Cantonese too
I don't think there's been any significant cultural exchanges between Slavic countries and Portugal throughout its history, with maybe the exception of a moderate Ukrainian immigration in the last 30 years
Portuguese culture is heavily influenced by Spanish, French and English culture, as well as the African and South American ex colonies
A lot of it comes from being far away from the centre of Europe, which has the biggest population density and where a lot of things spread outwards from
As for language sound, I once read that the stereotypical "Slavic" sound is a fairly conservative one from PIE, so maybe we kept it as well
Hard to tell because we had a lot of influences in our language, but we've never been anything but the fringe of each invading civilization group, so maybe influence wasn't as strong
We certainly have very conservative aspects when comparing to romance countries
But it might just be a lot of confirmation bias at this point
> at this point this can't be a coincidence
It’s not
It’s due to confirmation bias
We also say one with flies tho
I think it is "Killed 7 flies with one blow"
The connection wasn’t that
Portugal got *chá* directly from the Mandarin word spoken in court due to it’s direct trade connections with China
The rest of Western Europe got it from Dutch, who got it from Malay, who got it from South China’s Amoy word

Even so, here you're only required to have your identification card and a certificate of approval (a small blue brochure-like paper which also doubles as a temporary driving permit, valid for 60 days after you pass your drivings exam)
During those 60 days you go to the IMT (authority regulating transportation), and they file in your details with your identification card and your certificate
2 weeks later, you get your driver's licence in the mail

I am Portuguese and live in Spain, so I know a bit of both
I may be very wrong, but I get the impression that a lot of Spanish unemployment are people who actually do work, but do so without paying taxes (for example a cleaning lady that does not generate an invoice)
So they're actually counting people who work as unemployed
Otoh, Portugal has been gaming the statistics since ~2006
There are state run employment centers
The only people that count as unemployment are the ones that are registered and actively seeking employment through there (which is mandatory to receive unemployment benefits), but since then you stop receiving benefits after a couple of years and those people just stop going to the employment center
Don't count the unemployed people
These are misleading numbers

No thanks I'll stick with the local chickens that are half the size of American ones
Let them keep their fat chickens
[No
Hell No
Why the fuck would you bleach chicken
Fuck their low quality chickens lol
How can people in cold countries know when it's okay to skate somewhere
Like is there someone who measures the thickness of the ice and gives the ok or is it just 'it seems frozen so lets go' ?

Because nationalist leaders real work out well for you, Poland
History repeats itself etc, etc
So we've got a proto-dictator to the East in Turkey, preventing them from joining the EU
Then fucking nazis enter the Austrian government, so now we're again afraid something bad's going to happen
And fucking Poland goes and gets a government in place that looks like they behave like NK and they want to leave the EU, bringing more into question about its stability
A broken EU is bad for many reasons
You could even say they have been about the only thing keeping countries in the continent from going to war with each other again, not to say provide a measure of economic stability
This is bad
This subreddit censors anti-european union, anti-immigration and pro-nationalism
You are pro-european union pro-globalism and anti-russia propaganda, where's your moral high ground
Worked pretty damn well in the states as well
"You are not a free-market capitalist
Why do you hate America so much
Why are you unpatriotic
The BBC is very biased
The heart-felt disappointed "hating country, being unpatriotic" is stronger, I think

Portugal I’m proud of you buddy
I love the rare ocasion when Portugal joins western/central europe :’)
Portugal at 10th
What a joke
The Prime-Minister threatens to fire journalists and pressures the TV networks to stop airing news pieces that are prejudicial against the governments image, especially regarding the 2017 fires
This is a FUCKING JOKE
The Portuguese government just paid 15M to several main news outlets a couple of months ago with the excuse of the COVID
They even had the brother, the cousin and the best friend of the prime minister ruling all 3 major channels, until his cousin was forced to quit her job because she was censoring news about the corruption in the government
News independency in Portugal is reaching dictatorship levels
The local press here in Portugal like to stir the pot with their freedom
Especially in small town tragedy/accidents and football
Some channel's (even they're on-the-scene reporters) will openly mock people/clubs
*cough* **cmtv** *cough*
In Portugal the press is free if you want to write socialist bullcrap
I discovered how great Portugal press was once i saw how biased were other countries like USA
I would like to let people be aware that our government bribed the media with 15 million euros during the lockdown
Being from Portugal and living in Bulgaria for 10 months I really feel the difference even without being able to read local newspapers, especially in the way pandemic was handled here vs what I hear from friends back home
We are always either nordic gang or east gang ahah
Don't you mean Malta, not Cyprus
Source would be great
It seems weird that CMTV, SABADO, Publico, and other newspapers and news organizations would love to make a big coverage about it
From what I could understand this is the feedback provided by organizations of each country and also taking in considerations laws and crimes against journalist
That's some solid, out-of-the-ass, evidence
Not to mention that our Prime-Minister had family members in positions of influence in the main TV networks (including the public-owned one)
Some fresh air would be nice
Has been 35ºC for the past two weeks, and it's going to continue to be for a while
Unless we talk about food
Then we get full Mediterranean again

Not a good time to be quarantined (especially since I'm pretty sure my symptoms are just my regular allergy/cold, but this is a year we can't take risks)

Ok deal
But you have to take half of our debt
Yes please
Well it's easy to have more than 0
But it's more about culture and climate
Portugal has undeniably a mediterranean climate and fauna
SIC - [

Same for us
That always happens to me
Well, I'm not using public transport now, I'm working from home
But obviously, not only would I wear a good mask, I wouldn't go to work today, with these symptoms (although cough isn't one of them)

2021 has been a shit year to be \[insert nationality here\] with an expired passport
Don't know about you, but I can probably get a passport faster if I traveled to Portugal and got one there
Embassy is a joke
I don't get how I can request an Id online and get it in 1 week, but can't do it for a passport
Why aren't the same level countries ranked by name instead of a random mixture
nice
We are home boys
It would be fun to see this with the total population of the countries (if someone decides to do it, don't forget to add the countries' own population to the total, to account for large population countries)
I needed a passport to enter Russia on a visa-free ferry (I was in Finland at the time), and I went to the embassy in Helsinki
They told me to set up an appointment online
I sent them an email doing exactly that, and they ghosted me
Then I sent a second email, this time to a different address in case I got the first one wrong
Ghosted again
How fun
Needless to say, I didn't go to Russia
The cute version of operation barbarossa
They've ghosted me too a few times
I usualy have a better time when my wonderful wife talks to them
These embassy guys have a seamingly easy life
To be fair I don't know what they do when their public hours are over - 9 to 12 in Dublin - but it's kind of frustrating dealing with them and not understanding how busy (or unbusy) they are
I might be wrong, but I'm under the impression that UK or Irish citizens can have and keep both passports
Portugal is the same, the country accepts citizens with multiple passports
I don't know if that applies to everyone in Europe though
Ah I see what you mean
Good point
I believe you could be able to ask for a new passport and keep the older one until it expires
I don't remember having to hand it over last time, but that was a long time ago
Never forget
How did soviets treat the liberated prisioners
I know quite a bit about the eastern front but not about this in particular
The USSR wasn't exactly the most kind of states but I can see them using the liberation as anti nazi propaganda as well at the time

That’s my theory as well, they want to hoard the power for themselves and the less ties there are to the EU the better for that
> The Brexiteers are a group of UK politicians who have repeatedly and stridently shot down any proposed way of leaving the European Union but insist that Brexit must happen
well that seems
counterproductive
Thanks for the explanation

Lisbon heading for 42°C today, yikes
Seriously guys, 30º-35º is not really all that hot
When you start sweating simply by being in sunlight for a few minutes (40º-45º) then you're entitled to complain
seems too high in some countries, even Portugal, does this keep track of official residences
because if so it's very likely that they just leave earlier, but the official residence it's still their parents home for convenience (my case at least, since i've been renting rooms/apartments since i left home at 18)
Oh god
Spoiler, I guess
In Portugal, people can't afford a simple funeral, let alone leave their parents
I've been working since I turned 18 (just turned 25 a few months ago) and I am about to finish my dissertation and get my Master's diploma
In all those years, I barely managed to save any money, because every job available is an extremely low paid one
It doesn't even cross my mind leaving my parents' house any time soon, especially when rents in Lisbon are higher than Queen Elizabeth's life expectancy
Fucking hell i had no idea portugal's was that high
All I see is the warmer the country, the more people can be outside of it and the more you can tolerate living your parents
If I was stuck inside in a snowstorm for 17 years id probably want to leave ASAP
Definitely, yes
Youth unemployment, and also most jobs created on the last 10 years or so are really precarious and underpaid
All while rents are getting higher and higher (at least in Lisbon, where I live)
I'd say this is the main reason why some people only leave their parents home in their late 20s.
Then there's also the cultural factor: in Mediterranean counties it's common to only leave your family home if you're getting married or moving in with a partner
Go Slovakia
We used to have a minister of economy who faked his degree as well, if I remember correctly

Portugal goes to Greece, so nothing really changes then
well, thats 10 million portuguese wondering were the ocean waves and tides went , besides that , im totally cool with this
How do you say "Thank you for your codfish" in polish
I guess we're switching our olive oil based cuisine for an olive oil based cuisine
Switched with Greece
Not even made
My country just went from debt to extra debt
Portugal NO NO NO NO NO the economy, we are Not Greece
Ahah
ahah
How to lose 69 braincells in 39 seconds
Not just beaches
The must beautiful beaches in europe
Oh, the sunburns
Does this mean Catalonia is the new Scotland, Galicia is the new Northern Ireland and the Basque Country is the new Wales
Water is warmer, but the waves are smaller, I dont know how to feel about this change
Greeks thought because of Covid, they ban us and thus we couldn't enter the territory
How fools were they
We even brought Little Portugal along with us to Cyprus
The fish camarada, the fish
There is no portuguese sardine in the mediterranean sea
Yeah, don't even know how to fell about it
Guess we finally became Greece like the politicians told us we wouldn't
\*Insert Darth Vader NO here\*
Are the climate and water similar to the Algarve
The only thing bad about Greece are Charisteas flashbacks

I know
That sucks

Yeah theres that part
Warmer water and no tides
Better for beaching, worse for fish eating
He's in ~~Romania~~New Greece now
You’re right, I should have deduced it or should have googled it
Your bitchiness sucked though
Thanks for your answer anyway
I debated myself about that, I think it works both ways
As a counterpoint to what you’re thinking, Wales has gibberish as their language just like the Basque Country
And Galicia is the cultural brother of Portugal just like Northern Ireland and the Republic
Seems that he has to go to Switzerland to do that
We'll mix it all up with meatballs, rice, and fries
It will be great
Sure, the more the merrier
You guys would probably have to mediate between Portugal and the Netherlands though
It is, no doubt
I guess we are just used to it
But water down in Algarve is a little better
If you return, try the North shore of the country
We use the expression "até dói nos ossos", that translates to "even hurts your bones
I’ll remember next time I see BiH
Your bitchiness sucked but you taught me something
If it wasn’t for the bitchiness I would probably forget
Yes, that's the main argument for going the other way around, but I didn't want to focus on a negative aspect
I didn’t understand it even after looking it up  maybe I’m just dumb
Aww just like WW2

ah, ok, my country is ded
Poor Portugal
Next time you make a post, include some sort of description about what we're looking at
Pretty colors don't mean anything without data
Hmmm
Portugal in the graph is definitely wrong
“Porto” for example, arguably the most developed city in the whole country, is marked as red in the map
The whole country in general is too red, and, if by means of comparison, anything would be considered to be “transitioning”, it would most definitely not be the south ... Trust me, I live there
This map is about money
not development
Portugal into
do your thing guys
I don't understand how Algarve is a transition area but North Portugal is underdeveloped
Oh Poland
My husband is from there
I actually feel like many things are similar in the countries, in the many visits I've had there
Seems it is because we are the butts of Europe
The north interior is a lot poorer than Algarve, if it was only Porto metropolitan area it would be blue
I think it's really easy to understand
It's the same for central Portugal if was divided in interior and costal the latter would probably be yellow
Yes it can
If the German is anywhere south of Switzerland it will look red as a lobster, making it seem that there is no suncream in Germany
The same thing applies for the British tourists
In fact, we call the British "bifes" (steak/meat) because they turn red like meat when they "grill" their bodies in the sun
Absolutely barbaric
Maybe I did not make myself clear
They are red like raw meat and lie there as if they are beefs being cooked in the sun
Please keep it up, good work, i want to see how this looks like in the end, BTW Could you please also do the islands (like Madeira, Açores, canary islands etc
Or are just doing main land
Cool

Some brave women walk around wearing high heels
Nah, we're good in our rectangle
We will only hit them with bread shovels if they try to take our rectangle
The problem with invading Spain is that it's full of Spaniards
(It's a joke guys)
Oh no, they're onto us
España? No
Los azuelejos fueron usado por los Moros, que copiaron las mosaicas Romanas (Byzantinas)
Pero quien los hacen mejor son los portugueses :\]
>Some brave women walk around wearing high heels
To be fair, they are usually foreigners and they only do it once or twice
I have seen one, going down Calçada do Sacramento where her partner walked a step down, she gripped his shoulder and took a step down very very carefully
And a few other instances
Locals do not do it - also locals tend to have different legs and cardio ability, and well different asses, crude but true
The calve muscles are even more obvious though
Fliflops also, tourists also do that a lot
I have seen a few which busted the strap and walking barefoot or hobbling
Really stupid, flipflops on hills with calçada, locals do not do that
I tried to do a quick google search and all I could find is that a king of ours visited Sevilla where he saw azulejos for the first time
He liked it so much, he brought the trend back to Portugal
This was in 1498
Don't know if Sevilla was already Spanish or not, my history is lacking
Definitely
Caralho, filho
Deixa uns sobreviventes, pelo menos
They were heroes, who fought, and in some cases died, for freedom
What they're saying is, you can either do whatever you want to your money, or come hat in hand asking for corporate welfare and state help
Not both
Exactly how it applies is open to question, of course
This measure should come with provisions for just those cases - like you paid early, ok you get help, but the time period is also extended
There is also a particular onus of management here: the company has not enough money in reserve because it gave it away
Maybe a measure to limit bonuses and dividends unless the company has say x months of operating money on hand would not be unwise
Note: this would only affect those who need money
So again, it is the responsibility of the private managers to decide how to manage
But the moment they ask for the public for help, they must accept impositions and costs
Otherwise, don't come for it
That's crazy
Lisbon has 353 hours in July, and I always complain when it's cloudy
But how do you have 17 hours of daylight
That's 7 hours of nighttime
I love EdinBUROUGH
That's cool, I didn't know that
Ain't that Reinhardt from Overwatch though
Damn my head is spinning
My head is usually used to working during the day
With daylight savings and all, I never go to work, or leave it, when it's night
I definitely need to spend some time there, to check how it feels
That ain't it chief
Hot weather and cold drinks is my kind of thing
You dare say cold is better than hot weather
YOU MUST ~~have a cold heart~~
️️ how can someone like both cold and hot weather
You're not human
We need to study you
Weather bipolarity
Maybe you are the Pinnacle of human evolution, you adapt to the different weather
You should spread your genes as much as you can
The opposite actually happens
If you spend enough time on a boat (let's say 16 hours a day for a couple of days) on calm waters you start to get used to the rocking of the boat (or house)
When you get back to land you get landsick (same symptoms of seasickness) and it takes a while until you regain your balance
I never experienced landsickness for more than a week, but I could feel it getting weaker every day
I'm guessing even the most sensitive would take no more than a month getting used to it
Assuming it's a gentle rocking of course
This is what I want
An army of mercenaries who do not belong of any EU country that follows whatever Germany wants
I mean what could possibly go wrong
What is the goal
Defending from bankrupt Russia
Attacking the middle east
Going to Africa
Maybe it's to remind it's ex-nation states to not play brexit again
Fuck off
Yes, this is what I want, an army of mercenaries who follow the orders of the leaders of the EU lmao
What a brilliant idea
European living in Texas
This chart made me feel really homesick
And why are we comparing ourselves with one of the worst examples
Only the strong survive
Darwin approach
Well, it really depends on where you live
I'm in Houston and Houston is an extremely diverse city with people from all over the world
However I fell that everyone is living within they're own community
It's a big city and everything is spread out, it's hard to walk somewhere hence you need to have a car to go everywhere, on the bright side there's tons of space, houses are big and bars and restaurants as well, there's never an extremely busy place with lines like it was in Madrid where I lived before
People are nice here although they are very kept to themselves and it's hard to make friends, my impression of the Americans is that they live very busy lives and don't have much room for new friends and any new relationships
The few Americans I know is because they don't have many friends and I am starting to realize that there many lonely people on this city
People live a very polarized life nowadays here, and it comes to a point where even this pandamic became extremely political
You wear a mask if you are Democrat and not if you are Republican
And that comes to another point that I feel about the way Americans think, people see things in a very binary way
Either blue or red, either white or black, there's no space for grey or to have a  middle ground position
Whilst I feel in Europe people have a deeper knowledge in polítical, social and economical matters and have less (yet maybe) less polarized opinions
One of the things I love here is nature, the natural parks are absolutely incredible, and nothing nothing in Europe comes close to the beauty of the parks here
I've visited Grand Canyon, Antílope, Yosemite, Sequoias and monument valley and I can assure it's absolutely mind blowing
Next week we're going to Big Bend here in Texas and later this year Yellowstone
Funny thing is none of my American friends have visited any of the parks, for them what's exciting is visiting the old and cultured cities in Europe
Makes sense
To conclude, I like living here but can't see my self living here for ever, in March 2021 will be two years and I could stay one more, however that should be  time to get back to Europe
It's for sure an interesting and rewarding experience to live here as an European
imagine calling the USA not developed, must be pretty sad having a non-developed country having large number of troops in your country :/
> excess deaths is by far the most accurate statistic we have at the moment
Not exactly
Portugal for example had a streak of untimely cold weather right at the start of the quarantine and those usually also make the number of deaths rise
When is the 2nd vote happening
Why aren’t they on opposite sides of the screen
/r/mildlyinfuriating
that looks amazing, but
internet
I can’t begin to understand how bad it must be to live in a climate like that
We were all cold as balls here in Portugal this weekend with snow on some high places, but I’ve already enjoyed my daily dosage of direct sun to te face today and left my coat at home also, I think us southerners wouldn’t last long there :/
Hang on there buddy
yeah we dont have anything like that here, during the winter we just turn our heaters up and grab blankets, and keep in mind that's with like 5\~10ºC
Yeah, we are not used to that, here in Lisbon usually when it drops bellow 15ºC people start using scarfs and coats
But on the other end we really love our 30ºC days, witch I bet would be the end of times there eheh
President of Portugal taking a selfie
Taking selfies is this man's part-time job
Even while on vacation, he spends half his time talking to the press and the other half taking selfies and giving people advice
Even Mr pres gets more chicks than I do
We call it a Marcelfie
For the people talking about their age: it's a fucking photo mate
With the fucking president
Chill
O rei delas
Noooo they're not social distancing
Dude's an absolute baller
If Marcelo can do it, so can you
É por isso que sou português caralho
Dude, he does BTS scenes
Time to go back to work you don't have the banks and TAP to lick the ass
Go Waste my Money as always
You forgot about the hugs
Never forget the hugs
Everyone can tell it's Marcelo
Like how the president is the only one wearing a mask and maintaining distance
Pretty sure it was the other way around and that is not his phone
It is basically a meme right now to ask the president for a selfie
Everyone tries to take a selfie with him
Even I have tried
There's a running joke that at this point, most Portuguese have a selfie with the Professor
They asked
He might legit be one of the people with the most selfies with different people in the world
He does this everyday multiple times per day there are people that go a beach that usually goes to with the intention of getting a selfie with him
Nah, they look like rich Lisboners
They are not fat enough for that
No every girl can be Frau Farbissina
They look like girls from Cascais specifically, I can hear their Linha accent through the picture
You know what
Having travelled quite a bit in Europe, especially the Mediterranean basin, the people I found who looked more like us Portuguese outside Portugal were the Turks of the Aegean coast
They looked more like your typical Portuguese than the Spaniards do, which I found pretty odd
Nah, the light skinned and blonde girls look either foreign or a mix of foreign and portuguese
The rest look Portuguese
Look, he that most of all, more than the girls
Verdade
All of them
> But there are LOADS AND LOADS of Turks who look like White Europeans
Oh I know, when I was in Istanbul I saw everything, from Turks that looked like your stereotypical Middle Easterners to other Turks who looked stereotypically Irish, see through pale skin and the reddest of hairs
It felt like half of Eurasia had made it's way there
He is the most queque of all queques
Bless him
We do not mind
And since he is so queque he surely was not the one suggesting the selfie, we know
Somebody might have called him "tio" during this pic though
Surely several of those girls did
And there were no second person singular conjugations in sight
Wholesome
I mean, this is "common" a dude just put it on reddit and it reached the front page of the sub

So millions of people who voted for him are fascist too
You probably think they are racist as well, does that include the millions of Black and Hispanics who will vote for him in record numbers for a Republican candidate
So you're saying that black Trump supporters are racist
Towards whom
And Hispanics too
Towards whom
They are indoctrinated in their schools, as those are mainly very left wing,so it's definitely not from there
Maybe they are just free thinkers and they like Trump's policies and they don't believe all the lies from the mainstream media
What has Trump said that was racist
I'm still waiting to hear, 4 years later, I'm still waiting
Do you have a clip of him saying racist shit like Biden has
I am smart, that's why I like Trump's policies
Lol so what is the Democratic party then
The kids in college there are all braindead left wingers who support socialism, so someone must be teaching them that
It's the colleges and universities
I've been to the US like 4 times, and I loved it
For me it's by far the best country in the world and I've also been to Germany, which was the worst country I've been to
I wouldn't go back there if you paid me
So Lincoln, George Washington, Jefferson, JFK, Reagan, Roosevelt etc weren't at least good
I mean many were regarding as great Presidents
Trump is a great President too
I haven't found anything racist on his twitter
He is a pretty bad racist when you consider he has done more for the black community since Lincoln
More than Obama, even
Cya, wouldn't wanna be ya .
Is it just me, or is Europe looking kinda of THICC
Portuguese are sad with less space for cod and sardines
The Iberian peninsula is just vibbin
As a portuguese I can confirm
Iberia just vibing through the Ice Age
I remember watching a documentary not too long ago where it claims it was quite lush and green
It was the melting of ice on the Scandinavian peninsula that cause its (Scandinavian peninsula) floor to side and thus Doggerland to lower as a balance of sorts
Much like a continental seesaw

MWF is one of those things that boggles the mind
The damn soap seems to last forever and its so good
A man of culture
Ach Brito makes some really good soaps (not just shaving ones)
It's a shame they don't make any hard shaving soap, it's all paste and in tubes
Any soap from Sweden you recommend trying
I'll look it up
Thank you ;) may your razors be always sharp

Parabéns Lituânia :)
Why did you draw Estónia so small
It is cool, but it also sounds like someone mispronounced Lithuania and Latvia at the same time
but it sounds good, somehow
I too light my fireplace when temperatures reach 10ºC
This is what northern europeans vacationing in southern europe during the winter look like
Here in Portugal we have regions in this time of year that can have 5ºC in the morning and 20-25ºC in the afternoon
Plus, some regions have rain with 20+ ºC. The sweat doesn't go away all day
> god damn 15º degrees during the day
Cute
I freeze with 15c.
From a Portuguese point of view, i won't wear my t shirt until it's a solid 15º-20º in the morning
5º t-shirt is not comfortable, not even if you are Nordic, that's just stereotypes, i'm sorry that's just dumb, take a spring jacket and a t-shirt, and you can just take your jacket off, you guys surely can afford to dress well
I don't like spring jackets, so when it is that time of the year where it's too cold in the morning and too cold in the after noon, i will just wear a hoodie in the morning, it's something you can just carry, it's not that hard to carry your hoodie is it
Oh sweet child of summer
if you knew what winter is
As a Portuguese in the North, when I go to Portugal now, the winter feels like summer
It's bad
Our physical education classes in spring/summer are so hard
Running outside, playing football etc
with 25ºC it's hell
Barbecue
In 10ºC? How can you even hold the tongs with your mittens on
Not to mention the fire hazard that is the scarf
The day
Well I go to work in jeans and tshirt in the summer, anything from 20 to 32 is confortable, more than that and it gets less confortable
Nah, you missed the joke :(
Danmark only has one summer day a year, at least for a Portuguese ;)
*goes into hidding*
You forgot the underage wife
how that mean a hard border between scotland and england
the mind boggles, though of course scotland is welcome
(and england also)
They just need to start using masks more often and take it a bit more seriously
To be fair even the experts had trouble advising people
America is so divided in politics that using a mask becomes political
I see a bull case for the US
Why are we comparing ourselves with the US again
Leave them be
Brasil has very strong incentives to over report death numbers though
Well, his true name is Temujin Borjigin

I hope they don't back down and they offer a copy of AOE2 so people can play the mission of Genghis Khan conquering the chinese lands
> In 100 years will be no mongols in China
There will also be no Uyghurs or Tibetans
You mean the ethnicities that were exempt from the one-child policy
I don't mean to defend China's treatment of ethnic minorities but you're completely out of your depth here
That's an absurd exaggeration
>It's kind of ironic as in Europe nobody really cares about their fights on history interpretations
I mean the Greeks and the Macedonians about Alexander the Great
> Chinese market is seriously overrated
What do you mean by this
If they're making money they're not going to stop it's pretty simple
In a few years you will not be able to find a person that was a live in ww2
Some are not even using masks or scrubs
The cleaners at hospitals and just about everywhere, the truck drivers, people at supermarkets, the police and firemen, aircrews transporting things and repatriating people, people at farms and factories producing food and essential stuff, the army evacuating nursing homes and cleaning those up
Fucking right
Let's end this
That's why I never understood the bashing Russia gets
They tried to make bridges between both nations by giving it a common language and state and people act like they did a bad thing
SMH
Guy must be ripped
Proud European here
Would be interesting to compare with the previous 30 years to see if there was an improvement (1960-1990)
Same as Portugal
Mapillary/openstreetcam will reach that, some day :D
Only reijavik and the "suburbs" appear to have people, and maybe a small town in the east side
They probably do have some villages close to that circular road

Germany: BECAUSE FUCK SPEED LIMITS THAT'S WHY
TIL Portugal is a Spanish province
According to this map, there are no speed limits in Portugal
In portugal you can go from 120-150 kph with a small fine i think
After that i believe is jail time
Money laundering paradises, that's all I see
But it is almost a tugastate
Some of those nations did a military coup though
Those rarely end well
In hindsight, we were very lucky in '74
We could've been taken by the military or the communists as a new dictatorship
If Salazar was still in command, and if that meant a more aggressive approach was needed, do you think it would turn out as it did
Caetano was subtly easing away sanctions (minor ones tbh), and he was still part of the Estado Novo, but he had less overall control
Implying we weren't
Oh yeah, that is true
We were very lucky that the military were very quick to act and that the government stepped down somewhat peacefully
Scotland should take back control

Cerveja
We also apply that term, it's "bebida" in portuguese

Barbarism never introduced circumcision
Why don't we call it like it is and say its a traditional jewish practice
I had to be circumcised when i was 7, but it was a needed operation
So i dont think it's unnecesary, doing it when there's no need is though, but you should clarify your point
*after careful review, lung cancer can be avoided completely after removal of the lungs at birth
Before there were any here, when only native Europeans existed aka barbarians, there was no circumcisions, then they migrated here throughout the years, and still do, and you'll see an increase in their practice not only from them but also from the weak willed Europeans that were brainwashed in doing so as well
What is so mind boggling about it
It's not a barbaric practice, at all
It's a foreign and hebrew practice
I see, but the problem is that native Europeans (not the majority of course) ARE doing this and have been for a long time . Mostly because they were fooled and misled by jewish doctors and their propaganda
Yes, I know it's not the majority here and I had that in mind, what I'm getting to is that those non native practices should be illegal here in Europe regardless of the people who want to practice it
And going back to my initial statement, I vehemently disagree that foreign practices such as this (and many others) be called "barbaric" because it has literally nothing to do with it
Portugal with money
Completely unrealistic

PORTUGAL CARALHO
For great justice
What do you mean
Indeed
The Portuguese language evolved from the Galician-Portuguese (the so called "Old Portuguese") for the most part
It's not far from the truth when I say Galicia and Portugal are like brothers separated by history
We had that before, didn't work out
Fell to the ground by 1640
At any rate, when it comes to culture and tradition, Galicia is indeed more portuguese than spanish
Madrid owes Lisbon that much
However, the portuguese-spanish border remains pretty much untouched since the Treaty of Alcanises
That's quite a feat, all things considered
Heard it's Europe's oldest border
That we had loads of money at some point
But not since 1910, that's for sure (Maybe just before WWII until the end of the 50's)
Poor guys, trying to spawn in 2017
Spain would recieve many Euromonies to smother it at birth
For the same reason people say Spain and not España.
From when
In Portugal at least half of it isn't there anymore
That's clearly only major lines on the majority of the map btw
Yoy can actually see the GDR border pretty well
Crazy how Athens is still 1400 years older than Rome is

Ladies and gentleman, the President of the Portuguese Republic Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa
Back in December I was randomly waiting for my bus at 22h and he passed with a bunch of people in front of me
Wasn’t expecting to see him so randomly in 300km away from Lisbon .
Here a french journalist interviewing him in the street without realising his role
Then at the end he asks "what is your job, and he answers hahahahaha
My dad just randomly meet him at a beach once proceeded to just casually talk to him like he knew him and tell him how we had the best beaches in Portugal
our president is really swagalicious
i have a selfie with him on the beach
LOOOOOOL eu literalmente tenho esta foto guardada na galeria pra mostrar aos meus netos em 2070lol
His power levels are just TOO HIGH
We have a name for him "Marselfie", because he is named Marcelo and he likes selfies
Not a good president, but popular because he "kisses and hugs" everyone
Popularity does not mean quality
What am i suppost to do with this information
Inter marche> Continente
You are not Portuguese if the President has not given you a beijinho yet
He actually took the decision to self-isolate some time before all this mess became really serious
Maybe he had access to information that the government didn't disclose, or maybe he just wanted to give the example
I believe the second option
There is nothing unusual about a president going to a supermarket shopping
I have seen Jorge Sampaio myself shopping (not a supermarket though) when he was president
Maybe Cavaco and Soares would be unlikely, but Sampaio would do it, and I think Ramalho Eanes also (except when he was president, security was a much bigger issue)
Didn't France use guillotine until 1970 or something

Old habits die hard ne
The leaders of Portugal 500 years ago included queen Leonor, who gave away her wealth to found Santa Casa da Misercórdia and spent her later years in the clothes of a lay sister in a convent
She was, at her request, buried in the middle aisle of the church as a sign of humbleness so people would walk over her grave
Her brother was quite capable of great acts of show off, but was also quite pragmatic at not showing off when necessary
Just the fact that someone without (their) blue blood was ruling would be sufficient for them to go mental
I mean, people don't carry weapons here, and the country is a lot more peaceful compared to the US
Portugal is one of the safest countries in the world, top 3/4
Violent crime is almost zero ( people getting shot/stabbed/etc )
What's the point of assassinating him, we'd just get another president, people with political ambitions aren't on short supply
It'd be like assassinating the Queen of England
That's the point of this post, exactly
I don't know why so much people don't like him
Então o homem agora não pode ir às compras
Not a good president
He has the personality of the people, he is the best person to represent us
I bet you like that other mummy guy
Wasn't he in contact with kids from a school were corona viruses cases apear
I think it was both setting an example and to avoid potentially contamination anyone else if he was infected (which he was not)
Is that the one who killed her husband
> She was, at her request, buried in the middle aisle of the church as a sign of humbleness
I, too, am extremely humble
Well I like marcelos lack of protocol like the one you see here , he’s humble , a nice guy , he is too diplomatic ... like I see himself as a man of no strong convictions especially regarding the garbage the government does and he just lies in bed with them ... doesn’t help Costa and ferro Rodrigues just voicing their support even before Rui rio ( the leader of the party that made marcelos political career ) . So yes Marcelo is a wonderful human being but no perfect president of republic
Because he's the king of popularism, of showing up to give a kiss, calling popular morning tv shows to wish good luck, trying to please greeks and trojans
I like a president that does more than wave and smile
I also like a president that has some backbone, not one guy that today criticizes someone and says that he should be liable for his mistakes, the next day says everything is good and the following day he says there wasn't any issue and the Portuguese people should be thankful of the person he wanted fired 2 days before
You should know this, as this happened just a few days ago
So, no, I don't like this guy
He is the guy that says that blue is better than red and the following minute says red can also be better than blue
Then he says he will take a look at it and then we will give a better informed opinion, only to brush off any future questions about that
This has happened too many times
Perhaps, though it is more likely it was her brother
If it was poison, and could very well be one of the many diseases in a relative backwater
She was the one whose son's body was returned to her in a fishing net, so her arms and of the institutions/city she founded include the fishing net
He made some oopsys, that right
Like the most recent one with Centeno
Not the ideal, yeah, but better than the previous one
At least this one we know he's doing something
By american race theory I think we can pretend to be at least in three different groups lmao
Ok, I remember reading something about her
Just to make sure, her brother is D. Manuel and her husband was D. João II, right
> At least this one we know he's doing something
You are clueless of how bad he has been
You are just saying that because he is popular and he is always everywhere
Tell me what has he done to help the people affected the fires in 2016
What has he done in the scandal of the stolen weapons in the army
What has he done to stop the ever rising number of nepostim in the government
What has he done in other important matters
Nothing, that is it
He promised the people affected by the fires in 2016 they would get help and quick action from the government and 4 years later most still don't have a house and all the money and goods given to those people are still locked in warehouses
The incident with the stolen weapons
Nothing has been done, no one is responsible, no one takes the blame
The nepotism
Why the hell would he do something when his brother has signed 14-FOURTEEN-14 contracts with the government in the last few months
You say something, I say not the right kind of "something" i would like to see from the president
People are too fucking PC here for someone to able to do a joke
Dont worry dude, your joke was lame, but i still think it was funny
Yes

Simple compromise: cut off all the statues' one hand and one leg
It would force people to be inquisitive as to why and learn from it
How about we replace his statue with someone better worth remembering
He won’t be erased from books
Don’t worry
I mean, I get your point
but in that case it's also nice that the people want to pay homage to someone from town even if way less famous
It's the same in pretty much all countries, you have hundred of statues of George Washington, of the Duke of Wellington, of Vasco da Gama, etc
sometimes in places where they have never been, so, yes, praise your local rapper, your painter, that old lady that always said Good Morning to everyone or the postman that always brought treats to the neighborhood's dogs
In my opinion that's the best way to teach kids for the future, showing them that good, knowledgeable and successful people don't need to be from other town, from a far away place and a far away time but rather someone next door
> If a community dislikes the naming of certain things, at the end of the day it's their area and they get to do what they want

This, very well said
*Perkele Intensifies*
This is smart of them
Not least because home companies, even with corruption, sort of keep the money in; and chinese companies simply extract the funds
You get fucked on the balance of payment issue even if you do end up getting cheap and good work
And very often their work is shoddy and follows no certification
Meanwhile in Portugal, our politicians want more and more chinese intervention in our economy
It is a EU wide policy, countries can still choose if they want to follow it or not
China is as much of an enemy as the EU, even less so in many regards
My point is:
Even if the romanian companies are bad, still better than chinese
If they are decent and even good, then they are A LOT BETTER than the chinese option
Market fundamentalists say "its all about the price", but then do not follow their own advice
Because if it is all about the price you count ALL the price - including the money and taxes that stay in the country vs what is sent outside
Well they can impose by denying something else, which is what they do
If you don't follow rules you don't get to use EU funds
The EU, just like the other member states are enemies, just like china
It has its own goals, independent of my countries goals, and thats what makes it an enemy to be fought
It doesn't matter
The EU interference in internal matters is more than enough to make it an enemy
Mistakes and treason happen
Not to mention the EU we joined was a significantly different thing from today
If tomorrow the EU were to return its competences back to what it was in 1986 i'd be happy to reconsider
There is no us here
There is me, and there is you
We have no more in common than i have with the chinese, hell, in many ways we have less in common
How many years of cooperation and trading does romania and portugal have
a handful of decades
What about Portugal and china
450 years
If language, cultural currents and religion are the standard, i'd much rather reunite with Brasil and the portuguese speaking african countries
Clearly you're not a historian either
We didnt have colonies in 1970
They were overseas provinces, and its people were portuguese citizens
As for the "destroyed economy" claim, if 10% yearly GDP growth and 16% public debt is a destroyed economy, then what do you call the absolute disaster that has happened since we joined the EU
The EU has been good at one thing only, Bread and Circus, while destroying our industry, our economy, makes us dependent on it and being a breeding ground for corruption

>The phenomenon of politely inviting someone and not  actually meaning it exists in the Netherlands too
I believe this exists pretty much everywhere in Europe at least
Had family members say to me "Devias cá vir um dia destes
", which translates to "You should come over sometime", which is just, in fact, politeness, not an actual invite to be taken  literally
Doesn't mean there's no intent behind it, could mean actual interest to hang out *in the future,* but not an actual invite, nor a commitment to perform an actual invitation
It's more aligned with small talk than anything else

You know the best wines are from the driest years
Grapes are a [dry farming] crop
They still need a minimum of water, but just enough for them to grow
More than that and the grapes will have too much water content to make good wine
Theoretically deserts would be very well suited for vineyards as long as you had a controlled water source to provide that required minimum of water, but it's far cheaper to just grow them in places with a wet winter and spring and a long hot and dry summer, like much of the Mediterranean basin

Just remember that Chinese numbers are litlerally too good to be true
Bunch of Americans seem buthurt about the Chinese doing better here
Honestly, even if they are fudging the numbers their response was better than the complete fuck up that has been going on in the US

Ok, I guess I'm triggered
Brazil instead of Portugal **RAGE INTENSIFIES**
Cool, maybe Brasil will actually pay attention to us if we're a part of their country
As a Portuguese, Spain flag would fit better than a Brazilian one

The more I look at it, the more offensive it gets
Italy, fucking brilliant, almost died laughing
This is very offensive

Would have been more offensive if you made Portugal like it was part of Spain
Still pretty funny
As a brazilian living in Portugal, I can say this is very accurate
Oh cool we're brazil now, i could get used to that
It would be way worse if they put a spanish flag there

Most of the times yes
But sometimes you exagerate with the whole lisping thing and what you say sounds like gibberish
Don't worry, we are just talk bad of you right in front you
No biggie
The languages are very similar
80% of mutual intelligibility
But they struggle to understand us speaking, as we have double their phonemes and they aren't used to listen to a lot of nasal sounds
I've heard Spanish people say Portuguese is much closer to Italian than Spanish
Which is quite untrue seeing as I can understand Spanish without any trouble while Italian is pretty much gibberish with a few sentences in between that I can get
your whole number system fucked me up in school
You know us too well
The African colonies usually open their vowels a fair bit (except the more educated people who actually did study Portuguese in Portugal during colonial times), so it sounds closer to Brazilian than to Euro Portuguese to us, since we notice the differences more than the similarities
I'm sure it's an uncanny valley situation, but I'd say they are somewhere in the middle, even if a bit closer to ours
I feel the same about Brasilians
I remember my friend going "Your dad talks too fast to understand

Informal spoken Finnish sounded like a very different language, almost like a bunch of grunts, when compared to the other registers
It's because everyone on reddit speaks English so they understand everything you guys say, be it good or bad
On the other hand, virtually no one speaks Swedish outside the Swedes themselves, so most people don't know about these stupid takes from some of the Swedes

I love it here don't get me wrong
All in all, at the end of the day, it is just a mild inconvenience that pushes me to learn German faster, which is a language that I absolutely love
I don't think there is any ill will from the Germans, I just think that, like the French and Spaniards, Germans are naturally bad at learning languages, generally speaking of course
As a foreigner living in Germany for the third time, from what I've seen, very few people can speak English here
Pretty much everything that comes from an Anglophone country to Portugal is subbed, let it be a movie/TV show/Video Games/etc

Why do you think religion exists
It is a natural human reflex, to cope with the unknown of the world, the unknown of death, sorrow, grief, to have a meaning for many

Religion is a set of ideas
Saying fuck all religion is like disliking free market capitalism and then saying "all economic models are bad" because of it

My country is also small, poor and has a lot of green energy investment, making nuclear energy even less important
And since a certain zone in my country has suffered a massive cancer rate rise due to your country's radioactive waste, forgive me if I take those allegations of "energy nuclear is safe" with a grain of salt when even the richest country in the planet can't be bothered to clean its own trash
Or when countries think that it's ok to build nuclear plants on one of the most seismic active zones on the planet

Bad for me my country is still in the dark ages
This is indeed great news to the indo European people
Now we just need to get rid of non native religious influences
Not weird at all, Europe is full of nations states, each with it's homogenized population, some of the bigger countries are getting diluted by mass immigration but the small ones are keeping it real, tradition is something that isn't lost in a flash, it's a gradual process of dilution, my grand parents didn't care about the church, they raised my parents as non religious people, and me and all my cousins don't believe in god either nor do we practice religion, yet, we attended church as kids and went trough the process because here in Portugal the church is like a "school" you go to on Sunday, even if my parents didn't go as adults they still enrolled us because it's tradition  and we decided ourselves not to care about it when we came of age, weird, but still they didn't force us to either go or not go, it's just the societal default, people are just getting smarter and noticing the Church is just a business like any other, they sell you social acceptance, the feeling of belonging to something greater, you know
Same thing in Portugal
Even that high number of Christians is most likely people who claim to be Catholic but don't attend church aside from the occasional wedding or baptism (we still have a high % of Catholics though)
Religion as a all is the world's biggest enemy rn
I fail to see how the ethnic makeup of the different states (and even though it doesn't like so, there's plenty of non nation-states in Europe) has anything to do how religion is supposedly part of "real tradition".
Hey yo
You must love to drink that fucking american juice
Same in Quebec
The Church was at the centre of French Canadian/Quebecois identity
And then in about 10 years, with the Revolution Tranquille, the Church took a backseat
It depends on how and what's the intent
For example if it's using Islam as a way to be racist I'm not a fan, if it's denouncing the ingrated misogyny I react differently (unless it's doing it disingenuously as if all of Europe wasn't so)

EDIT:
Foda-se, who did this map
Porra
Porra
We say porra in Portugal when we are in front of sensitive people
Foda-se
and Caralho
are the real ones
EDIT: in some years, how will I explain to my grandkids that my most upvoted comment on reddit is this one
This is wrong
In portugal it's FODA-SE and not porra
False
CARALHO or FODA-SE is the real most important word in Portugal
Porra
Fds, caralho, mas que merda é esta
This map is clearly wrong, considering all the upvoted comments in this post
I'd say OP simply went to Google translate or some online dictionary and translated fuck to all the other languages, just to get some karma
I downvoted because this map blows
The word "porra" exists in Portugal and is used to cuss
BUT, in this context, where it is obviously being defined as THE cuss word, then it's clear that the OP committed the SACRILEGE of choosing THE cuss word of the Brazilians and not the Portuguese, otherwise this would have been either "caralho" or "foda-se".
OP is now banned from r/PORTUGALCARALHO
just in case: /s
As a portuguese, we say Foda-se
"Porra"? Mas tamos a brincar
Foda-se
Actually, porra is not a swear word
It should be "foda-se" or "caralho" in portugal
Russia isn’t there because Russian is itself all bad words
Porra and Joder are not the same thing, not even close
r/notcoolguides
Porra
Foda-se
Portugal should be "Foda-se"
Porra
More like a good ol' FODA-SE CARALHO QUE É ESTA MERDA
Foda-se quésta merda
Portugal also accepts Puta, Fodasse, Caralho and a multitude of other funny sounding slurs
in Portugal it´s "Caralho
" and not "Porra
r/PORTUGALCARALHO
r/Portugal
Porra
Ai foda-se, puta que pariu caralho, quem é que diz essa merda
We say FODA-SE or merda, but definitively not porra, thats old fashioned and fun fact also means jizz in portuguese from brazil
Hey, Portugal here
Not porra, Foda-se
In Portugal no one says porra
We say Foda-se and Foda-se was my reaction when I saw this map
In Portugal, "Foda-se" is the most frequent swear word, "Porra" is used predominantly by Brazilians
Porra
A única pessoa que diz isso devia ser eu no 5o ano
About the portuguese one, doubt X
At this time I can’t even count the times people assume that Portugal is somehow Brasil
As a Portuguese this starts to annoy me a lot . Not that I don’t like Brasil, but in my opinion this is very disrespectful towards Portuguese language and Portuguese people
Although we share most of our vocabulary, don’t forget that there’s still a lot of differences between the two
Portuguese is way off
The word for the expletive "fuck" would be "fodasse".
Porra is the family friendly version here
We say Foda-se
It translates to "Fuck it"
Portugal one is not even close
It would either be "fodasse", which is fuck, or "caralho" which is cock and/or something similar to "fuck" and basically a word we use to reinforce  every thing we say
"Porra" is used a lot more by brazilian portuguese speakers
Also on a very interesting side note, "caralho" used to be a nautical term that defined the lookout post at the top of the main mast in ships
Since it was a very unstable spot, and just a shitty place to be, it would be assigned to people that did something wrong, as punishment
A normal curse used in portuguese derives from that:
"vai para o caralho" literally meaning "go to caralho", that shitty spot
Normal translation would be close to "go fuck yourself".
Foda-se
Really ?
The same for Portuguese “porra”. The equivalent to fuck would be foda-se
Um cona mole qualquer
Alguém que acha que em Portugal se fala brasileiro
Filho dum grande cabrao
Um most cases we say both "foda-se, caralho
" In this particular order
I came here to say this, FODASSE
What is this
Brazil
AQUI DIZ-SE FODA-SE E CARALHO
FODA-SE, QUE CARALHO
Another favorite would be CARALHO
One small thing just for fun: you can start pretty much any sentence with Foda-se and end it with Caralho, including the mythical "Foda-se caralho
" and still make sense
I like de flexibility of Caralho to be "arálho
Foda-se is like fuck or fuck it, but the verb foder or means to have intercourse, if someone says "vai-te foder" it means go fuck yourself
Caralho can be fuck, but it can also mean cock, but it is usually used just as an exclamation to emphasize something you're saying, for example: "isto é bom como o caralho" wich translates to this is good like caralho
Porra is a soft badword to use as an exclamation, it can also mean jizz, but it is more used for jizz in Brazillian Portuguese
Fun fact, foda-se can be abbreviated to fds
Porra - mainly used in brazil, means cum
Foda-se
-  Fuck
Caralho
- translating, means dick
, but can mean anything, depending on the situation
very true
That's the way
I did the same to my polish friends
Not really, not in Portugal
In Brasil, sure
it does, but brazillians use it more with that context than we do in portugal
We just use it as a soft release of anger or exclamation
it's still not the most common
the most used ones are the ones I said
Porra isn't really considered a swearword in Portugal
That space before ! always make me think the person saying it is almost expectantly waiting to see my reaction
No idea why
Sempre em capslock
This
'Porra' is more of a Brazil thing
We can say it as well, but the better words are 'Caralho' and 'Foda-se' (last one similar to Spanish 'joder')
> Belgium was a mistake
It sure as hell was
Wrong: it's used a lot in Alentejo
> Porra - mainly used in brazil, means cum
What
I don't know a single person that doesn't say porra
Porra caralho que te parta
Put it this way, 'Porra' is for when your mom wants to cuss but the kids are in the room
PORTUGAL CARALHO
Caps lock or no caps lock
FODASSE
r/SuddenlyGay
We sure have a way with words don't we
Haha, we are told the exact same story here about caralho
then the equivalent for "fottiti" would be "vai-te foder" or "fode-te"
today I learned
talvez expliquei mal, cá em portugal é raro utilizar porra para dizer esperma
apenas como interjeição, já é normal
Ah, sim
Heated Italian moment
In Portugal we also have a few fun names such as:
- Picha (Cock)
- Venda da Gaita (The Bagpipe's (Cock in slang) Sale, possibly
- Lugar do Além (Something as the Afterlife's place)
- A couple of towns including the word "Rata", initially a word for female rat, but most commonly used for female genitalia
As far as I know at least in some places in Eastern Europe the derogatory term is "Chorni" (black) and not "Nyegr" (Negro)
As is in other languages
It's normal that the person who wrote "Serbian nigger" is not trying to present a negative way
I used to work in Ukrainian kids summer camps and when they talked about black people they always said "niggers". And this was not meant to be insulting at all

Rain is supposed to arrive late this week, which would be fantastic and very welcome (unless it is a problem for any harvest, but I think the wine harvest is mostly done)
Hey Iceland, you have a place for me for a while
This picture is so hot
30 degrees on Alentejo and Andaluzia, time to wear our coats
Yeah, I feel this year hasn't been too bad for us
Probably could have used more rain here and there, but at this point, we can *always* use more rain
But temperature-wise, pretty standard
For them yeah
They got like 35 in Paris today, or 30 in London, for them it is a lot
Well more than we had
Here it has been some days consistently of 18-26 give or take a few degrees which is quite perfect weather for this time of the year
THEY had a hot summer with lots of heatwaves
Us (and the irish and the icelanders) had normalish summers for our individuals definitions of normal
The Atlantic is the best thing
Really
We are in fucking September
Of course 30+ for a couple of days might be considered a heatwave
People talk about this things because they don't understand shit
For gods sake we are getting some rain now, and let's hope the winter is not dry otherwise we are fucked for 2021 summer
People in Portugal have a really bad misconception about summer
Guys clear your fucking minds, our summers are not like the summers in some other places
Our coast is facing the atlantic
Most of the west coast, mainly the west coast from Lisbon up north shouldn't be surprised of fogs in the morning and the "nortadas" (north winds), many days a month on the summer months
People shouldn't be surprised of some rain in the summer, but every time it rains especially in the north people react like it's a fucking big surprise even though it is normal to rain in the summer some days even if it's only a small quantity
Sorry for the fucking rant
In Portugal
It is below 20 everyday, the minimum
Are you a foreigner who thinks max temperatures above 20 are high
Dude come on
It is quite fresh right now
Please don't
Please, this summer was normal for us
We didn't even hit 40° this year
Why does Cali have hotter summers than us tho
Is it the desert you have
Portugal is not an indivisible entity, it has multiple climates
This summer has been normal here (in the Alentejo)
Last summer was actually cool, there was only a single day where it reached 40 degrees (in contrast, this summer, over here we had 2 weeks of 40+ days)
Yes I know it has multiple climates
This summer wasnt't normal even in Alentejo
Just go and see the Boletim Climatológico of IPMA
I trust the data not the perception of summer of people
Hmm
Interesting
Our winds always come from the north
Our heatwaves always come from Africa tho (like this pic)
They're very unusual
I guess that explains why LA is hotter
And the Santa Ana winds explain why LA IS hotter in August whilst July is Europes' warmest month
Sure thing buddy
From the sea yes
Our coasts are cooler because of that
Wind rarely comes from the south so all we have is strong winds from the sea, colder winds of course
Stanford University, interesting
Resembles a lot with alentejo and algarve
Definitely reminds me a lot of my Algarve
What is the location
I've been to Andalucía several times, but mostly the big places: Ayamonte, Huelva, Cadíz, Sevilla, beach places, etc
and none of the smaller places
Very beautiful town, those who went there suggest visiting it
Let's go Russia
As we say in Portugal: The people are who rule the most
Can I get on that list too
I'd reckon that every single country in existence is going to end up on at list at some point
Why is this even on r/Europe
Great picture
Can you share with original quality so we can use it as wallpaper

Wow, that was a master stroke by Schulz
It remains to be seen if what Merkel did was intentional or not
It probably emptied what would be a big discussion point for SPD in the elections though
>BÄM
you are precious
The portuguese answering "heh
" to all questions
We are just like, Meh, whatever
Portugal, the real neutrals,
That's us alright
It's the only true Portuguese way ;)
Foi tipo um que abriu um post no /r/Portugal se éramos um povo Gay friendly, comentario de topo foi mesmo tipo meh we dont care
The Portuguese way is saying we don´t care but deep down we actually do, we are just "too nice" to be straightforward about it
going off of my parents (and other Tugas over here) its just that they rather we marry to Portuguese instead
We're like : We've lived with all of those for so long that we just joke about them all the time
But at the end of the day we're pretty much ok with any of them unless they steal our bacalhau
Other option could be : Heh
as long as he/she is hot or good in bed
We only care about football, sun and party
The Portuguese way is saying we don´t care but deep down we actually do, we are just "too nice" to be straightforward about any important matter
Like
whatever
Do what suits you, just don't bother me
Thats us alright
"Desde que não se aproxime do meu cu não me importo" - Every Portuguese when asked about that
Nos só queremos saber da nossa vida xD
Heh
it wasn´t, actually
not blaming contractor but municipal authorities
I'm heartbroken :(
As a portuguese this makes me cringe
Portugal please
We were kings of the world
Best season by far
And now António Guterres  Secretary-General of the United Nations
except we still have many songs and shows "not available in your country"
Hum
they should look at the mobile plans in Portugal
For instance on Vodafone they have a plan with 500Mb for 2,25€ a week where the traffic generated by Pokémon GO, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook Messenger, Whatsapp, Skype, iMessage, FaceTime, Viber, Spotify, Vodafone Call + and Message + is included and doesn't count for those 500Mb
If you use Telegram for messaging it counts, if you use any other social network that's not Facebook it counts and this happens on every provider
Haha, good luck getting the rest of the public to side with you on this, all they think say is "so what, you're getting stuff for free, why are you complaining
" when that is a terrible mindset
I'd rather they give me another GB than those free apps
What if instead of using the Facebook app I want to use a wrapper
What if I use Pandora instead of Spotify or signal instead of WhatsApp
These are common real world scenarios and these isps are essentially giving these apps a monopoly
Just a few days ago I said to my friends that maybe we should ditch WhatsApp and move to telegram, none of them wanted to switch because they have free WhatsApp
That's a clear violation of net neutrality and possibly monopoly laws
But the FCC is getting rid of net neutrality completely, including home ISP's.
congrats on the president
This is so so much better than all those hundreds of photos "it snowed here

So so much better

Asking for a friend
Portugal just got vacations in 1580-1640
Oh boy

There is this stew with peas and poached eggs which takes easy ingredients and is kind of wholesome comfort food
It is even seasonal though noawadays it is year round thanks to frozen peas
Ervilhas com ovos à portuguesa
If you can google translate this recipe
the sausage might be complicated, it is not the same as any italian sausage, but I think it would be good with just bacon or similar
I do not include any herbs or garlic, they can kind of kill the flavour of the peas - but a bit of tomato passata if not ripe tomatos is important
this recipe in english is actually quite good  (though if you do not have chouriço, bacon or similar would do)
If you have dried cod and patience (and eggs), then a lot can be done
Eggs are really seasonal right now
I strongly recommend you make a francesinha, it's one of my favourites dishes
And good luck to everyone
You’re doing god’s work
Now chickens are kept in big factories and it is all really controlled so we have constant supply throughout the year, of eggs and lots of other things
But usually, traditionally chicken laid less eggs (or some chickens stopped laying) during winter (mention here for example  and with the arrival of spring, they started laying more eggs
hence egg being a symbol of Easter and spring, and lots of egg recipes for this time of the year
I remember when I was a kid when grandmamas distrusted shop, battery, eggs, there was hoarding of eggs in December for all the christmas cakes since there were few eggs
Even now, if you are into (ilegal, but nevermind that
I cook those well
) eggs, those are scarcer in winter
It is similar, but it works very well also with just bacon
It is traditional to this time of the year, when the peas are out, and it is very cozy
It is one of the backup meals of every portuguese home cook
edit - just to make it clear because I found abominations when googling recipes in english, the eggs are cooked right on top of the peas
the egg white sets around the peas, which is fine, and you cook the eggs to your taste
(I am still shocked over americans poaching the eggs in water and then assembling it)
Also slow cooking the onion and bacon/chouriço is important
He was probably talking about homegrown chicken eggs in the old days, atleast as a fellow Portuguese I've never heard about eggs being seasonal or lack of eggs in any time of the year
> atleast as a fellow Portuguese I've never heard about eggs being seasonal or lack of eggs in any time of the year
ask the oldest ladies (or better not) you can find
Things can be naturally seasonal
We are out of touch of it a bit right now, and even back then there were eggs even in darkest winter, it was just they were more plentiful (and better) when spring arrived

I went from Helsinki to Tallinn, Riga adn then Vilnius in ~1 week just before the whole COVID shit went down
Did the whole thing by train/bus and it was surprisingly cheap
These capitals are relatively small so you can see them in a couple of days
I wouldn't bother with helsinki again though, not much to see and everything is really expensive + I did the boat ride to Tallinn at night so I couldn't even see anything
> Was it weird for you
The only thing weird was having two legal currencies during the transition period, other than that it really didn't make any difference on my day to day
It only really made an impact on travelling in Europe or with dealing with people or companies from other Eurozone countries

There are lesser cold days and more warmer days in the future I would say
It looks normal, maybe  sedate (good
) around here
No issues
34 max, 17/18 low, great summer weather
I am hardly ever turning on the AC
At least for the Iberian Peninsula it has always been like this
It's not possible to have a summer without at least a few 40ºC+ days
And Portugal you know the Litte country on the left SIDE of spain
wow, 24, 24 C. All of that, thoughts and prayers
24 C. Wow
Portugal is just happy whit Galiza on top of it
I just like how spain is fed up with Portugal
San Marino placed a little lower would look like a monocle of Italy
Most eastern countries havin a good time
Ukraine: *A A A A A A A H*
You should add more islands, Azores, Canaries and Madeira
Why is Spain so depressed tho lmao
Oh the eyepatches on countries with flags with patches
Nice
I wish Portugal could get one as well, in the tradition of Camões
I would add the Madeira, Azores and Canary Islands
Otherwise it's pretty dope
Galiza and Portugal are basically best buddies :)
It's about time you ditch Spain and join us
It's only right
Haha
There are "forces" that want that
OP probably only drew regions with significant separatist movements
And Portugal is laughing at that, I just love the detail in this art
Do it Galiza, that would be cool
Great idea
But sad to say that in Portugal this would never work
Looks like Europe got a herpes outbreak

Can I move to Finland
It's too cold here in Portugal
But
but that's cold :\ can't wait for the 45ºc :D (it was the max temp last summer)
Meanwhile in Lisbon the maximum for today is 19ºC... It's officially hotter in Finland than in Portugal
Toughen up
Portugal: Hah
hah
HAHAHAHAHAHA
melting ~~I'm fine
~~with fire
>temperature is about 27 degrees
Now that’s a sauna
if i went to a sauna and temperature was similar to 27 degrees in a train I would want a refund immediately or I would call the police
dudes, you are looking like southerners complaining of cold when it'
s +10
>When the sun shines multiple days in a row without a cloud in sight the temperature indoors can get much higher
open the windows at night, or dusk
It will cool it all down
and for fuck´s sake, shut the shutters during daylight particularly in the hot parts of the day
I once had to explain to scandinavians they really had to shut the shutters in the morning but they fucking pouted about the concept that the house would be dark during daytime, while they were not even there
not sure they did what I told them to do
and that would be a fair comparison to say a Finn complaining (fairly) of 35+, or 40+ or 45+ plus heat anywhere elsein august
But this meme of finland burning down at something like 22, or the other day, 10,  I wish this meme gets a well deserved rest
or it might suffer heat stroke, from those temperatures in the low 20s...
it fucking sucks i want my 30ºs
Yep, who do you think carries the torch for tech innovation in the EU now that the UK is gone
The German
lol
Apple Music also offers premium in the EU, so I don't follow your logic, tbh
But that's because of their business model, not because they aren't European
As a Portuguese, I’m surprised Portugal’s figures are so good to be honest
We might be poor, but atleast we are responsible
Paying bills > eating
I'm surprised we are doing so well here in Portugal
It could be a consequence of direct debit being so widespread
So perhaps this reflects more how good the companies are at collecting payments than how finantially stable households are

I used to work in a supermarket in Portugal and I would get sick by the amount of food that was thrown away
Workers couldn't take it home and had to pour bleach on said food so that people wouldn't do what this guy did
We had the same happen recently here in Portugal, but it was like an entire kitchen full of food
Fucking disgraceful waste
Ptasie mleczko are just the best sweets ever created
Pingo Doce
They used to but someone got sick on some expired food and they stopped doing it
They did the bleach thing in the first store I was in
In the second the dumpster was kept inside the store at night and taken away in the morning
Still, there were lots of times when someone had to open packages of expired food like pasta and rice and throw them away because bleach wouldn't sufice in that case
And this had to be done by people who in many cases could barely afford food with the shitty wages they were paying
Unreal experience
I'm assuming if people were able to get good food from dumpsters they'd get criticised so they purposely ruin it so that doesn't happen
Leaving that place was one of the happiest days of my life
Do they do anything with the recovered bikes

I'm afraid that you're incorrect
Opinio juris is not made up of  the opinion of jurists - in international law, the opinion of jurists is to be found in the decisions of the ICJ and similar adjudicative bodies - a different strand of IL entirely
Opinio juris is the embodiment of state practice, founded in the states' belief of a legal obligation leading to that activity
Opinio juris is also seen in the decisions of international organizations, especially UN resolutions
There is no doubt at all that this resolution can embody opinio juris
I agree with your description of jus cogens
I did not say that this decision alone would (or could) ever constitute jus cogens on its own
It is, however, possible that it would contribute to the creation of a new rule of jus cogens at some point in the future

Come on, you wankers dont even know how to roast cod
You want to catch a cod to eat it RAW
WHAT A DISGRACE
I CANT EVEN
I dont care how you kill it, I care how you eat it
ahah, thank you for that , you are forgiven, I love the Inbetweeners
'I am not gonna eat that, it comes from the FUCKEN sea'
Basically our 1000 cod dishes
Here is one of the [most famous] Its eaten mostly as a beer snack or appetizer
Another [one] It is made mainly with shredded thin slices of potato, we call it "hay potato", olives, cod, eggs
Third cod one
Its called [cod with cream] and its basically what it says
Cod, mashed potatoes and cream all mixed together and sent to the oven
My mom makes the best one, in Xmas its what we always eat
If you dont want cod, definitely recommend Francesinha, which is like a meat overload
You can find them especially in Porto
Its a big sandwich, with a juicy spicy sauce
Woah there buckaroo, in portugal we eat a lot of potatoes
They are in pretty much every traditional dish
I think a better comparison would be between potatoes, pasta, and rice
As a Portuguese person: since when do we prefer tomatoes
Lol we love potatoes tho
I don't think it's the case for Portugal
In my case, my grandparents always had tons of potatoes, tomatoes, corn and olives, in the interior
In the big city, I grew up eating a lot of potatoes, but tomato salad was always on the table
Is there are data corroborating this observation
As a Portuguese who is a potato fan, this is all sorts of wrong for me
These are both non european products that were imported from America by the Portuguese
Does it makes no sense to speak of such a geographic divide

If it is not really defensive, it is not a castle
That is not a real castle, it is a 19th palace with romanticized castle elements
I know in german they call everything schloss, but that is not so in my native language
Castles are castles, real defensive things
Then you can have palaces, manors, stuff like that, and a clue if it is 19th century and not really defensive (there are some defensive 19th century structures though not for rich people to live in) it is as much a real castle as Disneyland
You could literally put any European country on that title and that picture would fit and be true

How naïve I was
Pizza is different, you eat it in slices, getting a sample from every ingredient, top to bottom
But I even wonder how a person who does that to pasta would eat pizza
I put the tomato sauce on top of the pizza dough
Do you put it on the bottom
I have been defeated
wtf no Portugal
Liberals around here can't stop whining about us being a socialist dictatorship can't we get some recognition guys

Keep all the tourists
Thanks for butchering the Portuguese flag /s
What kind of yellow monstrosity is that in the Portuguese flag
Wtf is happening to Portugal
What's the portuguese flag
Kinda looks like the radioactive sign
Is the paint dry yet
Portugal is not macedonia mate
Thanks for putting us in the right place
Yeah it looks definitely on purpose considering that OP manages to draw crests as complicated as Serbia but fails to properly center a yellow-turned-radioactive-symbol sphere
I think he has a beef against us
Maybe he is a Spanish from Olivença.
Radioactive
Its an armillary sphere
I'm quite aware of that but it looks like a radioactive picto in that context
Oh yeah hahaha sorry
That looks like our Berlin balls (a sweet that we normally buy at the beach)
I wounder if they taste similar
In Portugal we have cakes like this, but we call them Berlin balls, and the have inside them a cream of egg and sugar
Here we also have variants of the normal Berlin ball with locust bean (alfarroba), and some with chocolate
Sure we're going to dethrone Cisco
but with what
So true
Linux is not a product
If a company wants to succeed in that market, it needs to do both
And needs people trained to install and service those devices
It's not easy
They sell what
Like 10% of what Cisco sells
It looks cold
There was a very interesting study on the effects of maternal nutrition affecting the pregnancy and how it exposes the risk of those babies developing Type 2 diabetes and other health issues in their adulthood

This
This should be done EU wide
It's time for Europe to remember that we're all on the same boat
Want to play rough with us, well, remember who actually *used* to give you lots of money
We may have no unified military and even political diplomacy is not very coherent, but when it comes to money
Well no € for you Mister
Beyond idiotic, boycott is a voluntary form of protest coincident with freedom of speech, until said countries actually impose tariffs or block trade this is completely illegal and sets a very dangerous precedent

Good job, tho
Now populate it
now release a bat there

There's so many Universities in the North of Portugal
I suppose most people that go there don't live there
Or leave, like I did
Question:
If the 12 years of education are obligatory in most of this countries, how can it be there are red in Iberia
I understand in Turkey, but here
We have colors
Im a social person from the North of Portugal (Braga) and I dont know no one less than 40yrs old with a level 2, fake data
What are the exact definitions of primary, secondary and tertiary
Because at least in Portugal there's a 5 year gap between our primary and our secondary
Oh god, now i am glad that i live in Madrid
(the blue and good part of Spain)
I still don't understand the logic behind the choice to divide Ribatejo in two
Maybe they did it for statistical reasons or because the Lezíria do Tejo is a region with a lot of farms and primary sector businesses like Alentejo has
But it's so weird to see concelhos like Rio Maior in the same region as Beja
It would be like puting Covilhã in the Norte region
Reminds me of Perfume: The Story of a Murderer
They are jewelry stores, not flats
Morocco isn't the hottest of places, you can usually find hotter cities in Europe most of the time (the northern part at least)
The things people can believe in never ceases to amaze me
There was an episode of HBO Rome which was called "The day Titus Pullo brought down the Republic". When I saw the result of Brexit, I immediately thought of the title "The day David Cameron broke up the Union"
Accident is too soft
He actively tried to prevent both of those things
Maybe I should ask David Cameron to steal a million euros from me, then I'll be rich
Wow
Now that's a place I would spend some time in
Beautiful
It does
Salty water
Same shit
BJ: If you guys don't gives us a deal, we'll leave without one
EU: We accept that
Boris Johnson is getting exactly what he wants, but this is for the Tory lukewarm Brexiteers
How exactly will the EU budge if you threaten to leave without a deal again
will this never end
just f\*\*\*\* leave already
AND TODAY IS INDEPENDENCE DAY IN PORTUGAL FROM THOSE NASTY SPANISH
Happy birthday Romania
Love from Portugal
happy  romania day
How can I help
Is there any way I can make a difference
Tl;dr of what this means for eu citizens
I believe that the EP can make the right choice, I've been there a month ago and I've seen how stuff works there so I believe in them
Also it would be pretty  dope to celebrate something on July 4 in Europe (it is also my bday =P)
As a Portuguese, fuck this
I didn't even get an automated response to my email and I sent it to him months ago
I'm sure that one way to grab people's attention is by telling them that the EU wants to kill 'memes'.
As in most parliaments across the world, legislation usually begins on committees and later on goes to a final vote (in this case the whole European Parliament)
that would see internet giants such as Google and Facebook *AND EVERY OTHER WEBSITE* forced to pay for linking to press articles
The principle of it is also stupid as fuck, why would you need to pay for linking
That's like charging someone for giving out the address of a business
Plus, it's not even optional:
> "Voss's latest amendments would make the link tax an inalienable right, that news publishers cannot waive even if they choose to," the Electronic Frontier Foundation points out
Also we've just managed to keep net neutrality a thing, why would we just throw it away
>That would mean they would have to **pay** instead of steal content
The end is near
Linking is stealing
I guess I shouldn't tell anyone where the nearest grocery store is and what sort of things they sell, otherwise I'm stealing from them
Wake the fuck up mate
>And for fucks sake, it's not about linking
What is it about then
Showing a preview which the sites being linked to make themselves
They can just add a little line to their robots
txt and all of the big sites will take them off their search results immediately
Why don't they do that if they think they are being stolen from
>>"Voss's latest amendments would make the link tax an inalienable right, that news publishers cannot waive even if they choose to," the Electronic Frontier Foundation points out
>Obviously
No, not obviously, why should I be forced to take money from someone just because they send people to my website
>No, that's not what it is
It's about Google News showing **half the article** before anyone clicks on that site
Is it
Because I don't see any limitation that says that showing 1/5 (or just title and subtitle) is fine
>Because then they couldn't be found anymore
What are you smoking
Why do they have a right to be found in a private service if they don't want to accept the rules of that private service

It also the case that London is one of the best cities to for restaurant
You can get all kinds of cuisines
wow, we pay 60€ for some slightly worse at 20ms
That's awesome
I pay 36€ and have 400mbps up/down
However, I also have 200 cable TV channels and land-line (but who needs that)
Service providers here in Portugal still mainly offer packages with TV and land-line included that you *have* to have even though you don't use them
My parents pay 70€ for 3/1
Fuck me
As I am in my fourth pint I'll take the time to express my opinion on the EU
All things considered, we've got our shit together

San Marino: am i a joke to you guys
We signed the oldest treaty in history and helped England in a couple wars and we're not even in top 5 :(
Lol they scared of Russia
Im offended that 2% never heard of us
Probably less about political events and more sunny beaches, great food and cheap alcohol of southern europe
Once heard of a person in a geography class that looked at a map and was shocked to know that countries had borders, she thought all the countries were round islands

Damn I just noticed on that photo, that [very dark area] in the center of Portugal, that was the huge fire we just had :(

Conservstives want freedum . But not for gays
Nor minorities
Nor the poorest
And in times of crisis, screw the middle class too
But we shall have freedum
The 1st it's called taxes

It matters the quality of living you make

Grandma in Portugal : it's cold outside, wear a vest
Apart from Portugal lmao
What do you mean has arrived
It already arrived in Portugal two months ago and am I fucking tired of it
Please send help it's way fucking hotter then it should be
Where
Not in Portugal tbh
I like nice sunny days but once the temperature reaches 25c it starts getting uncomfortable
If at least i could walk around in shorts and flip flops it would be fine but not on work days
toasty
Cries in Oporto
*está fresco, wear a vest
We had 29° the other day here
i was literally melting
>21-25
That's too cold, 30-30+ now that perfect temperatures
The "summer" didnt arrived yet
Im freezing
>I want hot summer
*Pedrogão flashbacks*
Pls no
It's probably every grandma
You are not wrong but june tends to be unpredictable nowadays
I am not complaining tho XD July and august will be super hot ehe
>To be fair, it does seem to be rather cold in Portugal for this time of the year
It is perfect, I love it and it is not unusual
We are one of the countries with less impact of temperature increase, botg current and forecasted
We are by the north Atlantic, which really moulds our  climate
Tbh it feels like Summer always arrives later in Portugal when compared to Europe but then it extends until October
> I wish winter would be an all year event
I wish the same
Low 30s in late September as a high is unusually high, too high IMO for Porto right on the coast
From the wikipedia
the average high for Porto in June is 23
5 C and September is a little bit warmer in all aspects, with an average high at 24
1 . So your weather was less average than today according to historical records
And the weather is fine and not remarkably cold in my experience
Ooh, I've climbed it many times
So adorable
What breed is this
Highly doubting the Spanish score
Been working with Spanish people for three years, they rarely speak English
When you speak English they laugh, when I speak Portuguese they say no te entiendo
I have to speak Spanish and don't even know how
Wouldn't the results not be exactly right since one's definition of "being able to read and write one foreign language" can be different from others'?
What about a foreign language that is not English
Portugal:
English since primary school up until high school ;
In 7th grade you can choose another foreign language, the most common being French, but some schools offer Spanish, Italian or German
BAAAAAAKA MONO GA
GERMAN SCIENCE IS THE BEST IN THE WORLD
That's a good point, but that won't happen
You'll deregulate the entire industry and allow huge corporations to mass fish
You’re making assumptions too lol
Amazing how we were in worse condition than the russians, who were coming out of serfdom
In fact we were by far the most illiterate country in Europe
One of the reasons why Portugal was so far behind the rest of the Europe was because almost all portuguese had portuguese as their mother tongue, while other southern European countries like France, Spain and Italy had several regional languages, which in a time of nationalisms and Nation States was seen as inappropriate, and led to an investment in public education
I think we probably still are
Being in the high 98% still might not be enough to not be the last on this race nowadays
ah ha
Privilegia goes brrrr
Yep, I think so too
I know plenty of old people (70+) in the village I grew up in that can't read or write
Safe construction right here people, also really safe road ...
I dont even understand why Im being downvoted, building houses on top of a cliff besides the sea is incredible stupid and dangerous
Our government (Portugal) said there was help available from us
Don't know how it turned out though
We haven't been under much heat and we're used to forest fires so I guess it would be a good help
The EU model it's actually the worst model
You end up giving consent in those small letters from enormous tos
It would be preferable to adopt a registry model
I get robocalls nearly daily from "the Canadian DOJ" claiming that I have a warrant for my arrest on my "account".
It's not even accidentally
If you don't consent the tos you are out of that service
You end up receiving calls anyway
The best model is to have a opt out list
We had that in my country and ended because of the EU law
Welcome to hell rest of Europe
You will now all be acused of being lazy and make siestas of 10h per day
Portugal at the top 2 and we are join by Greece, the 2 most western and Eastern parts of Europe, nice
Amareleja gonna be Amareleja
It's hot as hell there
And once again the Greeks beat us
Se aqui está calor, imagina na Amareleja
Feels like shit, doesn't it
Same, and I live in Portugal
fml
We are now colder than Germany
Guess we are the best now
You get used to the averae temperature
I'm from Portugal and i've delt with 40+ temperature
I hate hot weather but i could still take 30 degrees
Now i've been living in the UK for a few years and i'm currently being coocked with the same 30º i used to tolerate in Portugal
those confortable 1980's stadium seats
if it's anything like my country, someone made a lot of money with some extra seats they had laying around
And now can make more in turning them around

Ypres/Ieper, I recommend for one day visit, a small but nice city
The canal, a lot of good parks, memorials, the big arch, the cathedral connected with the Hall in the photo, Bicky Burgers, Cherry Beers
There is also a cats carnival party

One more reason for Galiza to join Portugal
It prolongs the vowel
They voted for it what do they want now
Thats what happens when you make a choice: consequences
What a bunch of crying irresponsible babies
That is not the only irony, now imagine that an un-elected head of state asked another un-elected monarch to suspend democracy
ain't that irony !
Best part of Europe is an InterRail
I did an Eurotrip this summer by car
I think its a lot better than doing it by train if you are not worried about money ( parking prices are ridiculous in some places ) and if you are not mentally hadicaped and are able to read google maps
Why you cut Portugal of the photo :(?
Prague always looks nice
Ireland wants to know your location
Now imagine a israeli christmas tree
Fuck, I was about to comment this
UK will have 2019 next year
I think Portugal's value is too high i would say it is like around 650-750
The actual median wage if you ignore the 1% is so much lower than that
Like 800 at most
Compare that with the price of energy (electricity, gas, gasoline, LPG, etc)
For intance, we in Portugal have higher price on everyone of the 4 sources of energy mentioned than Spain
Why Portugal
why
(I'm portuguese so I can talk trash of the country)
Hurray Portugal
Cries in portuguese
Would love to see how different this would look without the top and bottom 1%.
Portugal is wrong
More then 50% of labor operators recieve 550€ the minimun wage
*cries in Eastern-European*
BUT
why
That will probably be the median salary, but not the average one
We get paid in 14 months and this is probably calculated with 12 months
I managed to find some data in [Eurostat] which might provide this info (you need to swap the unit of measurement to PPS, rather than Euro which is the default selection when opening that page)
Here's an [interactive map] of that the 2016 data from that table, hope that helps
Cheap and quality labour probably
Median is an average, you mean mean
> Hard to believe Lithuania is better-off than Portugal
Euro + austerity does that to a country
Happy Independence day
I love your country
Joke of the year to this person right now
Despite popular believe that fascism ended with WWII, Portugal kept a fascist dictatorship until 1974
Portugal was the country that started intercontinental slavery
They took slaves from tribes or bought from other tribes where they were taken to the new world (South America - Brazil)
about 15% never arrived in Brazil
They would die of hunger, dehydration or mistreatment during the trip, normally these slaves when they died at sea were simply aitrous to the water
America had Vietnam
We had a war in 4 main fronts, each one thousands of kilometres apart for 14 years
The is still a notion here of it having been a romantic war, with a population eager to embrace Portuguese soldiers as liberators against the communist driven rebels and of Portugal as a mostly benign colonial power whose colonies were lost only because we had a revolution that delivered all colonies to the nearest Moscow inspired rebellious force ( well, I must say I agree with this part
There was a real political will to make sure the "right" party seized power in the former colonies)
What most people ignore is that not all of the war was romantic and that an entire generation still has to deal with the PTSD and physical injuries from that war and also that as other have, we too had our share of wrongdoings while trying to keep a land that was never really ours to take as for instance -
Maybe that’s why some Armenians bomb-attacked Turkey’s embassy in Lisbon in 1983 at one of Portugal’s top neighborhoods
Fuckers
Glad to see you guys put our only science Nobel prize to use
, I suppose
If Istanbul is Turkish then Ceuta and Mellila are Spanish
Ceuta was the first city taken in the portuguese expansion and then passed to the Spanish
Sooo
If they can claim it so can we
Ceuta to Portugal
All Heil the new empire of Portugal, Algarves and Ceuta
Why would I do that
Do you americans only think about destroying things
Jee
Every one in Portugal is happy
We must spare Galiza and Olivença though
Every portuguese is happy
If you eliminate Spain, Portugal and Gibraltar wouldn't be affected :) we also agree with your choice :)
America, like the whole continent

Decriminalized consumption of all types of[drugs] If a cop sees you consuming he can only forward your case to a psychologist that will try to help you overcome addition
You can’t go to jail for consuming drugs
Portugal drug policy since 2001 (i think it's the right date, it worked really well)
There's also the mater of handbooks in school being reused and free in order to offer a equal opportunity (although idk if its in only in the lower grade or if it all the regular education ei 1 grade - 12 grade)
Also i think you can have a non binary gender in legal documents
Edit
And also Portugal was the first country in the world to abolish the death penalty
Decriminalisation of all drugs
Portugal was the first country to abolish slavery
We were also the first country to make homophobia a crime against the Constitution back in the 90s.
That's just a scam
Downtown is littered with "drug dealers" that are not actually selling drugs, just random crap (like pressed culinary herbs disguised as weed) to trick tourists
Mixed feelings here, although I consider Portugal a conservative country at least at a cultural level (high percentage of catholic population, everyone is proud of our colonial empire) our politicians seem to have some very progressive ideals
The limit is 10 days worth
I don't know how much that is (really)
Our idea of catholicism is very sui-generis and has nothing to with Spanish catholicism and others
Just think that prior to the marriage equality law we had the highest divorce rate in the entire planet
We fell to the 8th place now, if I'm not mistaken
The gays saved marriage
Consider the following, most people are OK or in favour about gay marriage or don't care and most who identify has Catholic or any other domination of Christianism are not devoted or have a very wishy washi interpretation on Christianism that follow the love thy neighbour has if it was one self, the general love teachings of chist
Only a small minority is actually against, which are the extremely devoted and older generation which normally dominates the group of the extremely devoted
Plus i don't think that we are proud of our colonial past, i think most people are just proud of the sea adventures part of it and mostly the idea of "we went on an unknown path and discovered wonders and how we mark history" kind of proud
Although there's some lack of talk about some of the horrible things we did (like start of Atlantic slave trade for example, i think it should be a topic that should be more discus in school both history classes and philosophy, in order to understand why and how something like that existed and mentality that people to see others has objects and not has people)
Hell since the rise of easy access information a lot of the older generation have been progressively become more ok with gay people, they still think its weird in their minds (mentally of their generation and cultural aspects and historical context (most grow up during the fascist regime that was extremely Catholic in nature))
Is this the new season of "Years & Years"?

It was all a plan for the United Ireland, 4D chess from the british
When the UK said if we explore the land between Angola and Mozambique they would attack us
King Sebastian being a spoil brat influence by the Catholic and war monger, going to war and then disappearing never to be found causing us to be a royal union with Spain (we maintain boards and government we just share a monarch for only 60 years and got some problems because of that shit, fuck the Spanish monarchy
), but you know us Portuguese we detest the Spanish so we kick their asses and put a new king and be again 100% independent (kinda like some Irish and Scots want to do in relation to their state being in a royal union and wanting to be 100% independent)
Portugal's first King, D. Afonso Henriques, won Portugal's independence by fighting against his own mother, Teresa de Leão.
Letting our 24-year-old, single and childless king go to war against the moors because he wanted to be a saint
We lost, he went missing and we ended up being ruled by Spain for 60 years
Nowadays, that king, Sebastião, is our version of King Arthur
I've recently read that when Junot entered Lisbon with his French army and took over the empty noble houses, the people were so furious they filled with streets with as much human and animal feces they could get
The French were appalled, later the British too
Don't mess with General Winter
For my mother it looked like working double jobs, never having holidays and renting a house in a bad neighbourhood
She never had a computer, never had an LCD screen, never had internet and never knew what's Netflix
She worked to support me and my brother
She works as an unqualified healthcare worker in a public hospital
Her side gig was in a nursing home
Now she's better because she doesn't have to support me and my brother
We never got help from the state, except to pay for University
You live in an ostracized, run down community of gypsies
Clothing and other everyday items are hard to come by, and so you or a relative scrounge and beg for them
You went to public school, but were looked down upon by most other kids, who are taught, it matters not if intentionally or unintentionally, to distrust or even hate you
This dynamic continues in many ways into adulthood
Your community probably has some criminals in it, and you're likely to be grouped alongside them in other people's eyes, regardless if you're an upstanding, law-abiding citizen or not, and no consideration is ever given to how these criminal elements may impact you
Law enforcement likely mistrusts and mistreats you
People believe widely in conspiracy theories involving you and your people, most commonly that you are, in fact, incredibly rich and just pretending to be poor to leech off the hardworking non-gypsies
A far-right political party has recently risen to political relevance that seeks to formalise the brutal but informal discrimination against you
this is some George Orwell shit right here
chills
In Portugal I think if you are heavily in debt they will assign someone to advise/guide you but it is not as easy and subsidize as in the Nederlands which is normal because we are poorer
However there are some subsidies if you are unemployed or bellow poverty line
Masked poverty in Portugal is people in their late 20s and early 30s living in their parents home because they have a job but still can't support themselves, that is what poverty looks like here
PS how do you put your flag in your user name
I think it's a Russian thing
IMHO, no one writes better than the Russians
High-jacking to state some more
Unfortunately,  if you're heavily in debt there are no direct resources to advice you
I disagree with your view on poverty
It's quite worse
Poverty in Portugal is a family of 5 people where the father and mother work at a shoe factory for minimum wage ( 700 euro month), live at a council house with just bearable living conditions and bring some of the shoes home so the kids may help sow them after school
Those kids will never go to college or not even finish mandatory education ( 12 years) because there is no suport or economic capacity for the parents to help
That perpetuates the misery because those kids will end up at the same shoe factory, doing cleaning or construction work for the same measly pay
Real misery, like homelessness is fortunately rare because family always try to help and we have close knit communities that help those in dire needs
We're a country where you can go hungry but you'll never starve to death or be denied health care because we have social services that prevent such things
Let's just sum it up saying that we have a of people just existing and not having a life
Working their asses off just to get going, with no prospect of improving their lives
I felt exactly like this was an Orwellian dystopia
said it before reading this
Yes I agree with you
But the thing is those young people I mentioned are not doing much more than the minimum wage, even if they have graduated from college
So as they are educated they will probably never have kids because they know they can't provide for them, they are also just surviving
In this situation, if the children got into uni, they could apply for a scholarship from DGES and most likely would get it
This is just like a messed up edition of survivor
Problem is, this show has been going on for too long with no ending on sight
Same politics for 45 years and no change in sight
No wonder we're still leaving the country to be able to have a life
Correct
That's why I mentioned the lack of support
Those kids have almost no incentive to excel academically because they could be working to help support the family
True, I agree
Yes, definitely
I feel like I'm losing my portuguese and like I'm not good enough at english, so it's bad either way
I was talking to my mother yesterday and she corrected my portuguese because I used the direct translation of "in person" during the conversation
My master is taught in English so when I use vocabulary from my field of studies is very difficult for me to use portuguese terms to explain something
In all the other stuff I really prefer to speak in my native language cause I tend to think in portuguese and then translate to english
Yes
I have to use English daily on my job
Whenever I come back to Portugal sometimes I start to speak in English randomly without noticing
But the thing that pisses me off the most is when I'm speaking my native language and cannot remember how to say a certain word in Portuguese, only in English
Definitely, my native languages are Portuguese and Mandarin
In Portuguese a lot of the times I can't remember words which I know in English and Spanish, as for Mandarin, I sound like a foreigner who took a semester of it in college
It's funny, I used to have French at school, but everyone knew English way better than French (because we had more years of it) so for the French exams we had to constantly stop ourselves from writting in English
How are you so sure that your dog barks in English
Or your cat meows in English
Yeah but I mean imagine that your cat starts to eat pizza all day and then it would start to meow with the hands like [this] Could be an italian speaking cat
Our accent is not very noticeable I would say
You may realise that we are not English of course but I don't think people will know we are portuguese
Yes, although I don't have much of it
However I enjoy the Portuguese accent a lot
Somehow, from interacting even with Portuguese in English it feels like our "real" english, if that makes any sense
Sometimes I'll even try to lay on the accent if I am speaking with another portuguese in english (word or expression)
I'd rather not have an accent but I don't mind speaking english because of it anymore
Me having some speech impediments also doesn't a lot with it, I have some trouble pronouncing 'j', soft 'g' and I tap my Rs way too much, making an already quite slavic sounding accent, sound even more slavic
Yank here
I love love all euro accents
I do have favorites tho
Irish, Brit, German, Polish, and my adopted country Portugal  saúde
I do i sound like a 25 year old dude speaking in english, then when i speak in portuguese i sound like i am 13 ;---;
I've heard a lot of German English accents, some very stereotypical and others not so much, and honestly there's nothing wrong with how they sound
If anything I dislike it when Germans (as well as other nationalities) go for American accents because it creates a sort of uncanny valley effect imo
That being said I did use to have German flatmate who had a really good American accent and didn't sound weird at all
True
Já agora podes me dizer como conseguiste ter a bandeira ao lado do nome
I think the most noticeable is our guttural "L", but that's such an idiosyncratic part of our language, no one else can pinpoint it
Na app do telemóvel penso que é mais fácil
Entras nesta subreddit e do lado direito em cima tens 3 pontinhos
Carregas lá e diz algo como "add flaire" ou algo do género e escolhes a bandeira que queres
Imo, speaking to native English speakers is intimidating because you feel like you're being judged
I have no problem speaking to my non native English speaking classmates, but my classmates from England make me feel self conscious
Little dots
As a native English speaker
I'm not judging you when you speak English
Se falares mal português é que vou começar a julgar
I'm not getting weird looks or anything, I just feel that way because I put this unnecessary pressure on myself to speak perfectly, with perfect grammar, and without an accent, despite being aware that it is nearly impossible
Speaking to non native speakers gives me more room to make mistakes because I know they can relate
My English classmates are really nice, friendly people, I have nothing bad to say about them
The real question is why are iphones more popular in North America than androids
They are much more expensive and are not better
That's what I think is the main difference between Europe and America
People are not ashamed for being called "poor". In my country you Will be highly judged if you say that you receive a minimum wage and you're holding and iPhone on your hand, because it is a signal that you only care about apparencies
Since smartphones exist, I've had a Samsung, a Sony and a Xiaomi, all androids
Because with the money I saved by buying an android instead of an iPhone, i can make 2 or 3 trips abroad
It's a matter of priorities
Edit: here minimum wage is 600€ and an iPhone costs 800/900€
So do ours
WhatsApp is still better and far more convenient than regular texting
In Portugal, Lisbon is the black sheep for everywhere but Lisbon
For Lisbon, I suppose, the rest of the country is the backwater
Can't say I'm ashamed of any city in particular but Amadora seems pretty shitty as do a lot of places in "Linha de Sintra".
According to TVI in Portugal, portuguese people are ashamed of Porto and the north of the country in general
The name makes it sound a lot prettier than it actually is
Not Rostock
That city is just weird that big church in the middle and those soviet blocs, was there for a day and felt like an alien a lot of russian speakers, went to mcdonalds near of the train station and everyone was looking at me weirdly for trying to speak english
Isn't São Paulo a very important city economically speaking though
Vienna is pretty nice, though
And surprisingly quiet for a capital city
That's just a war between us and TVI, don't believe them they are fake news
Thought it was beautiful when I went there, but there way too few bins and the ones I find were tiny and full of trash
Littering seems to be a pretty big problem there
Lived there for one year, and I just have mixed feelings about the city
It's very very far from being an amazing fantastic city, but it's not as bad as the media seems to depict it
Compared with other Swede cities it is rough
So imagine the other cities
I'm portuguese, it was sarcasm
Foi uma piada, SÓ UMA PIADA
It was a joke
There was a problem with one channel because they discribed Porto's people s beeing old and uneducated
It isn't true btw
It’s usually just a disparity between the north and south where the north is mocked for its education and accent and the south is mocked for being uptight and rich and lazy
Porto being the north’s biggest city it’s usually seen as the representation of the north
A german friend told me that nowadays Rostock is more or less tha capital pf Nazis in germany
Is it true
Fair enough
What's so bad about the city anyway
Genuine question
I know Rio de Janeiro gets a really bad reputation but you never hear much about São Paulo
Eu sei
Mas quem não sabe o que se passou pensa que estás a falar a sério
Relacionado com o futebol é verdade
Com tudo o resto não
I would say that Dresden or Görlitz are worst in this regard, but they are very beautiful cities (unlike Chemnitz city centre)
Strange for a city that was once called Kar-Marx-Stadt to be nazi nowadays
Isso vai depender sempre do clube que és e vais dizer sempre que o rival é a vergonha do país. Mas a verdade é que toda a nossa cultura futebolística é uma bosta, basta ver os comentadores que têm mais audiências no nosso país, tipo o Pedro Guerra e o Serrão.
EU estou a falar com a perpetiva de um lisboeta, as pessoas prefeririam se a liga nos nao fosse 80% clubes do norte
Mas n há propriamnete um ódio ( exceto ao fcporto, por razões obvias)
Ok já deu para perceber que és benfiquista
Isto de a liga nos ter 80% dos clubes no norte do país não é por acaso
De Coimbra para baixo as pessoas só vêem Sporting e Benfica, e é difícil para os clubes do centro e sul contrariarem esse poderio
No norte, apesar de haver um claro domínio do Porto tens muito mais gente a apoiar o clube da cidade
Tens o Braga, o Vitória de Guimarães, o Famalicão e até o próprio Boavista leva sempre mais de 5 mil pessoas ao estádio
Isto não é por acaso
Contra factos não já argumentos, mas oque eu disse antes é o sentido que as pessoas não-nortenhas podem ter
E já agora, SOU SPORTINGUISTA
E no caso do braga n sei se concordo, a maioria das pessoas de braga apoia jm dos três grandes, e nem contra os grandes e europa conseguem encher o estádio
My bad
Nunca pensei ver esse ódio ao Porto vindo de alguém que não fosse do Benfica
Sim quanto a Braga tens razão, eu estudei lá e sei como é. Tem muito historial de adeptos do benfica e alguns do Porto, mas digo te que as mentalidades estão a mudar e há cada vez mais adeptos do Braga
Embora lá está, não como em Guimarães que é só Vitória e mais nada
Não é tanto ódio como um benfiquista
Já temos demasiados problemas internos para ter muitos problemas com outros clubes
Exatamente ahah o maior rival do Sporting é o próprio Sporting
We don’t even bother trying to come up with excuses
Being late is the default
"Sorry, cows" when someone asks
I live in the Azores and we have a lot of cows, like a shit ton, and many pastures between houses and towns so early in the morning and late in the afternoon the farmers and pastors need to move them around
We (Portugal) are just late, plain and simple, no excuses
came here to say this
being late it's part of our DNA
If you say to your guests to come to dinner at 20:00 and they show up at 20:00 or even a little earlier it's bad seen
How could they come so early if you hadn't have time to start to prepare the meal
So everyone gathers at the kitchen drinking with empty stomachs
so true ️️️
Honestly, I can't even remember ever seeing a bridge that opens here in Portugal
Can't you use tinder
Plenty of cows over there
I'm sure there are recipes online
Leixões
Not that it's an excuse, since there's another one, a normal one, fairly close to it
We have a way with people, trust me
Also,
#DRINKS AT THE BAR FER A POUND, COME GET YOUR COFFEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
EDIT: Right who the FUCK gave this shit gold
The typical office worker, works itself half to death but doesn't get a decent pay and dreams of climbing the ranks to get a better pay someday
Either that or PR
As long as the Netherlands aren't in charge of Museum security
Cleaning bathrooms, most likely
Portugal would be the boss
The guy taking coffee or taking photocopies to the boss
Portugal
We would be the toilet

I hate it
This was made by the same people that made Mr

Get the cachaça!
Same animation style [see]
Yep
I use american spelling but sometimes a british word or expression sneaks through
Like "reckon".
I personally speak BE with a British accent, so
Aye, american vocabulary + phonetics and british writting
Used to mix both a lot but after living in England for 5 years that is mostly gone
I can see that happening a lot when someone comes to visit me and speaks English in a very Americanised way
For example my gfs sister still say "yorkshaiar" (Yorkshire) and "det" (that)
To be honest I never experienced a huge shock because I kind of knew what to expect I guess
I've been to New York, Boston, and Orlando
Even though I had an idea of what New York would be like, I was still blown away by Manhattan
There's really nothing like it in Europe
I mean sure you get some places with quite a few skyscrapers, but Manhattan really is like a concrete jungle
Boston on the other hand, didn't feel too different from the cities you find in Europe (I suppose because it's one of the earliest American cities)
As for Orlando, I don't remember much of it as I went there with my family before the 2008 crisis and only recall the theme parks
One thing that I guess could be described as culture shock was paying with a 5 dollar note and getting my change back in notes
It's weird to me that 1 dollar notes even exist
Also being asked to show ID at a bar
How hard it is to walk in smaller cities
Everything is designed around cars
Want to go to the mall across the street
There’s a 6 lane road, good luck crossing that
If you somehow manage to do it, you still have to cross a gigantic parking lot that is like 10% full
The clothes size
I am M here, S in the us would be xxl for me
But are the buildings as tall and packed together as they are in Manhattan
I'm aware that there are huge cities in China (hopefully I'll get to see them someday), but aside from Hong Kong aren't they a little more spread out
I just assumed Americans had super low balls
You ask someone from my country for directions, he will go with you to the place so you dont get lost
There are jokes about this
That's a Scandinavian thing
Here in Portugal, kids cannot address teachers by their first names
It would be considered very rude
We always gotta call them "teacher".
I see this happening here too
People are in generaly kind, it always depend how you aproach them
Last summer I was leaving from the beach and this british lady with her son couldnt get their rental car to start, 5 different guys helped pushing the car and then by miracle there was a guy who was a mechanic and had tools, he fixed the car and she could go
There are some funny encounters
That was my experience when studying in Scotland
I knew not to greet girls there with a kiss on the cheek, but then I'd suddenly get hugged which felt a little too up close and personal
Cultural differences are funny
Luanda Leaks was a huge scandal in January in Portugal involving the richest woman in Africa, the Angolan Isabel dos Santos, which is the daughter of the former president Eduardo dos Santos
She owns many companies all over the world, specially in Portugal, and including the telecommunications NOS, and there were some news  recently telling this "NOS replaces managers linked to Isabel dos Santos with managers linked to Isabel dos Santos"
I think the Portuguese authorities have been very responsible, they’re not using covid-19 to do nothing under the radar imo
The olive tree disease is worrying
Not just to us, but it is passing under the radar and this could be very damaging agriculturally
On the other direction, normally we could be worried about drought,  in the past month it has rained a lot and drought seems less severe now
Normally we could be talking LOTS of the weather, or hailstorms or stuff, now, nope, nothing
Isabel dos Santos
They got the fuel prices lower now that people can't leave home, just to make people mad
(Sorry, it's just a joke attempt)
like what
I don’t think so
The prime minister didn’t want the state of emergency declared, but the president did it anyways
And he’s visibly worried and somewhat overwhelmed by the powers it gives him
Isn’t that a good thing
Well but instead of asking for money and remaining private, wouldn’t giving money and becoming the owner be better
It can now work for public interest
In Portugal we have TAP and they also ask for money and most of us would prefer for it to be nationalized again
Afonso
Quite and old but still common name
Men: Arlindo, Américo, Basílio, Eurico, Valdemar
Women: Esmeralda, Gertrudes, Joaquina, Leopoldina, Lurdes
For men: Sancho, Lopo, Cid, Inácio, Zeferino, Hermenegildo, Augusto
For women: Urraca, Estefânia, Eunice, Gertrudes, Virgínia
Maybe Sancho
Clotilde, Aurora, Felizberto, Américo
In Portugal, women names that have Maria and something else, like Maria de Fatima, Maria da Conceição, Maria de Lurdes
For men something like Hermenegildo, Álvaro, Xavier, Hermano, Alcides
João for boys and Maria for girls
Bernardo is a relatively popular name in Portuguese and doesn’t sound old to us at all, interesting
Afonso é um nome transversal a todas as gerações
Bonifácio ou Teodoro são nomes exclusivamente de velhos
I remember Urraca, she was Raimunda's sister right
Alfonso is the Arab version of Afonso, you know, because most words start with Al, you kbow
Não vamos esquecer a Odete, este nome parece que vem com bengala
Aníbal, também.
Our first king married raimunda, and like the Galician one married urraca
Well i think it's right step in the right direction, although i think there should be bigger coordination and cooperation between the European nations and kinda do follow what Portugal and other countries are doing in relation to implementation of renewable energy increasing it and reducing other non renewable sources and being power almost exclusively by renewable energy, about more than half of the energy consumption in Portugal is by renewable energy
I think technology wise we should invest in the development of battery of high capacity and do a open patent for the world and maybe create a international European car company that that only sells electric car and try to make them accessible for average European
Urging consumers to be woke won't make a big dent
Urging voters might
In pretty much every country the main polluters are electricity suppliers
We can all change to electric cars but if the electricity is dirty
It happened to me a couple of times with podcasts
I was listening to an English podcast and the next one happened to be in Portuguese, and for a second there my brain totally fried and I didn't know how to interpret the language
As soon as I realized it was Portuguese I immediately began understand it normally
Haha I do this as well when speaking Portuguese
Portugal:
Portuguese borders (A Raia) are the oldest of any European country, and have remained unchanged since 1927 (also one of the oldest in the world)
After being crowned king, the portuguese monarch D. Pedro crowned the love of his life, D. Inês, who had been murdered by orders from his father
He had the murderer's heart ripped out from the chest while alive, so he could feel the same pain he had
He then sat the dead queen on the throne with her crown, and had the whole court kiss her hand to repay her respect
It is absolutely untrue that portuguese people hate spaniards; we actually tolerate them pretty well, considering
Because of the period of the Discoveries, some local languages adapted portuguese words; my favorite is the Japanese word for "barbecue" : "churrasco" / "shurasuko" ~~"thanks": "arigato" / "obrigado"~~; a strange one for me is that in some languages like Greek, "Portugal" is synonymous of "Orange".
I was just kidding about the spaniards: we actually like them quite a lot, you know, considering
In fact they are the only country that has a sexual position named after them in our lexicon
Edit: I've fallen victim of a popular misconception about the origins of the Japanese word Arigato, which is strictly Japanese
Portugal has the oldest borders in the world
Portugal started the discovery age
It is said that the portuguese colonized Newfoundland and Labrador, due to former portuguese currency found in the area
The first man to go on a trip around the world was portuguese
The flag that is on the moon was made in Portugal
There are much more
Portugal's borders have remained pratically unchanged for 800 years, making them the oldest in Europe
The Portuguese Empire was the first global empire in history, and lasted 500 years making it also the longest
Portuguese is spoken natively by 25x more people outside of Portugal than in Portugal itself
The Portuguese were the first europeans to ever make contact with Japan
Portugal and England have the longest alliance still enforced in the world, starting in 1373 (647 years
We have more time as a dictatorship than democracy
Despite most people ignoring Covid precautions, we only have 50 000 cases since the pandemic started
(population of around 11 million)
Our famous "Pastéis de Belém" are so shit compared to other national versions of them that they refuse to participate in the flavor contest because they know that they would lose
By a LOT
We are the only country in the world to have ever filled for bankruptcy TRICE, and have just recently payed for the first one
('round 2008)
We (along with Spain, each had half) controlled the entire world's sea and, businesses depending on it
About the second point portugal's old anthem used to mention the british: " against the british march march" they then changed it later
Why do polish and italy anthems mention each other
This is a family sub, so I'll use Wikipedia's translation as "mammary intercourse".
Also, fun fact, the German and French also refer to it as the "spaniard", while in Spanish it  references almost any other country expect Spain, i.e. "Cubana", "chaqueta rusa", "una francesa, turca, o sueca" (in english: "the Cuban", "the Russian jacket", "The French", the Turkish", or still, "the sweedish")
Euthanasia is up for debate in parliament again so it's usually some variation of we want to murder all old people or euthanasia is eugenics (and everyone who supports it is as bad as the nazis)
Lovely
Holy tits
Really
Wow
well, not that
I mean, there are problems, but now they sound really more like inconveniences
"Não matem os velhinhos"
Oh god don't get me started on this, I know alot of religious people so I keep seeing Facebook posts about how eutanasia is making a doctor commit a murder, plus the Christian lobby is going all out asking for a referendum, which is dumb because it will pass if it goes to referendum
I mean believe whatever you want but don't impose your religion on my choice not to suffer unbearble pain
Funny how socialism is anti-racist and those types of beliefs come from deeply racist beliefs
I loved hungary but you guys do not like tourists or foreigners, can't imagine what its like to be a black guy in Hungary
Social services in the UK have a really bad reputation among foreigners
My friends in the UK with kids all complain about them
This fucking meme
Completely agree
Everyone should be able to choose what to do with their lives, bodies and conditions
Abortion has thankfully been legal for a good amount of years, hopefully euthanasia will follow suit and be approved soon enough
Ah, every day I grow more thankful that I don't use Facebook
I seriously never get their arguments, no one's making you choose to be euthanised, if you think your body is "sacred" or whatever, go right ahead, why should that have anything to do with what other people choose to do
We also have separation of church and state so I fail to see why priests that go on TV think they have any more say in this than the average person, but whatever
The your exercise is much creative
When is that it created
The my friends found the way the english wrote and spoke weird, but the other languages in comments are way more funny because I personally don't them know
I'll "translate" an excerpt of the Wikipedia page on cod from english to Portuguese sentence structure English
Original: "The two most common species of cod are the Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), which lives in the colder waters and deeper sea regions throughout the North Atlantic, and the Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus), found in both eastern and western regions of the northern Pacific
"Translated" : "The two species most common of cod are the cod of the Atlantic (Gadus morhua), that lives in the waters most cold and sea regions most deep throughout the Atlantic North, and the cod of the Pacific (Gadus macrocephalus), found in both the regions east and west of the pacific of the north
Well, [I] no know if am doing this well, but am trying
Think that the biggest difference on the grammar is the verbs and the omission of pronouns
Need to speak about anything
Am become dizzy while read this whole thing
Is probably best if don't speak about anything at all
The your comment is unexpected
I not make idea that the structure of the Spanish was so different
Now that I am writing this, start I to understand that we the Portuguese speak like man-caves
A hug from Portugal, brother Spanish
Even Saint Anthony would break his waterpot reading this Southernmost province of Portugalada
Had stroke while reading this
We are men of the caves
Have almost the certainty that almost all the rules gramatical in Portuguese are equal in Galician
I'd like a list, actually, now I'm curious
Ah, for sure there are pronunciation differences
I was more talking about sentence structures like the rest of the thread
yes obviously
I dont like football so I'm not the best example
But honestly, I've heard so many reports of thousands of (mostly foreign) construction workers that have died to build that stadium
Qatar can reach like 50ºC in the summer, and they were working long hours
Fuck Qatar
I've never heard of that country's team being anything special
so why do they want to host the WC
My country would never boycott a football competition unfortunately, it's our main sport and we have a team of stars
It's too much money down the drain
Dirty money
I never liked the idea of a tiny hot as hell country like Qatar hosting the World Cup
There was a lot of corruption behind that FIFA decision
What a joke
But I don't want Portugal to boycott it
Footballers are paid to play football
If there's a tournament, they'll play
They aren't political activists
Honestly, if we manage to qualify, yes
I believe that my country should boycott the Dubai 2022 Cup
In principle yes, but OTOH it is like our best shot ever to actually, maybe who knows, win it, so we can not afford to waste an opportunity while your current captain and star player is still playing
And we really really want to win it one day
Also if a lot of european countries boycott, it just gets easier, more likely right
Not that it will be easy, it never is, but still, if France boycotts, oh hello
Yes, I would and futebol is a huge thing in my country
I hope at least some of the really big players, like Cristiano Ronaldo, opt out this time
The last-last government sold profitable state companies at a low cost
The same government that, while in a steep financial crisis which lead to many people losing jobs and their homes, told their own population to find a job outside the country or to be less mushy
OH GOD DO I HAVE A GOOD ONE FOR THIS
So, Portugal has a conservative party (CHEGA)
Its presidente, *André Ventura* is kind of a dumb ass, the typical xenophobic and nationalist I guess
*But* he's also a writer
So imagine the fun we have hearing him yelling in the parlament and then remembering his books have quotes such as: *Oh how would it be to penetrate her, dominate her until I feel that miserably proud body give in a final sneeze, orgasmic* (page 38)
He has also said to another president (of a liberal party, as an attack): *The Livre deputtee must've been smoking dangerous things, the illegal kind*
AND he said, about the same president (who's a woman natural from an African region) that we should deport her back, after she proposed indemnities to ex colonies
I like to think of him as our own little miniature Trump
On another note, our cities are too crowded, maybe we should have more cities to make space for our people to live in
He also said:
“The poorest were not affected by cuts"
"We want to go beyond the troika"
"Portugal only comes out of the crisis by becoming impoverished"
“Being unemployed can be an opportunity”
"I will not raise taxes"
“We cannot live beyond our means”
“Fuck the elections”
He believes in treating everyone equally
He’s a god damn fascist
Don’t compare Dilma to that fucking fascist
It was a clusterfuck
But I'm glad we found a way out
EDP was created in 76, but TAP in 45
They were our biggest airline and energy company
Imagine comparing Dilma to a guy that is willing to let hundreds of thousands die because of the stock market
Was that Austrian fella that end up ruling German short
In photos and videos he seems average size for his time
And also taller than some other politicians of the time
I have a feeling that it is another propaganda myth in the same vein as Napoleon was really short
I don't know, honestly
And it doesn't end there - when they sold them at a black friday price, they didn't lower taxes
It's an EPP party, they were trying to shift everything to private hands, but I'm glad it didn't happen
That's just for display, they're conservative liberals
The Socialist party are the social democrats, and their "radicalisation level" depends on the PM and of what the marxist leninists and the trotskyists parties want
Sorry I didn't understand what you meant
In 76, they choose to integrate together with a conservative party, so it resulted in having  the faction that wanted the SDP model, and the faction that wanted economic liberalism
Nowadays, they are more social democracy leaning, because of their current leader
But there's a clash between factions of the party because one half of the party wants him and the other doesn't.
Seeing those embezzlers mad af when he got elected was a pleasure, though
I mean, corruption is inherent to an autocracy / dictatorship, so that's why corruption scandals didn't exist / uncovered, because things simply weren't recorded or if they were, it wouldn't matter
But yeah, embezzlers are also a risk that the people need to watch out for
Maybe it's because of the [millions] he spent trying to wash the regime
In authoritarian states, corruption occurred, but it remained anonymous
Without any free press, how can you say corruption happened
You have no idea of how authoritarian he was
He was an authoritarian corporatist, which involved the direct injection of money on the elites
No football
There goes half the newscast
And since there are no other cultural events, every report on the news is about coronavirus
There was even a report about how the RTP team in France couldn't do a report, because they were quarantined
It's already happenning: Our biggest national productor of beer closed its production :(
yeah btw why do all protests in France involve turning cars around and make fires
Nevermind I went to check and it was fake news
Of monster and men
don't be sorry, we should be thanking you
Hatari were great
Sure, can we be included in this deal too
We don't have it either and could also use the added benefits of being connected to the rest of western Europe and Europe in general tbh
Afaik all works in that regard have lead to a full stop in quite some years now
The projects are abandoned
As far as I've been told, there's simply not enough funds for us to carry it out and the idea was chucked out
That's the notion I got some years ago, on that matter, at least
I don't think I've even heard about the project moving forward, ever since Socrates ceased being prime minister
Nah, right now Portugal is building a line between Évora and Badajoz that's roughly the way the high speed line would be
In the future it will serve as a basis for a truly high speed connection between Lisbon and Madrid, provided the biggest investment is made (Lisbon's third bridge)
Yeah, at least there's that silver lining to this story
I read some of the top comments and then I look for Portugal
I actually never see any comment from my country
It's rare here
I remember seeing one on tv recently
I think it was an unicef ad
But it's not very common
I don't think we get any over here, can't recall anything at least
Well ads not a lot, although there are a few occasionally on TV, although there's during the entire year not always but especially around Christmas charities that patterned with big store so that clients pay a little more or donate x amount during the checkout in order to help charity groups but those are not always about Africa and are more charitable cause be it international or national
We the Portuguese have the ideia of Africa namely our ex colonies suffering starvation and bad economical problem (which has far has i know its true and especially in some ex colonies) because of the immigration and emigration and what people there described and what we see on the news
Hallelujah
The first time I saw it I had no idea what it was supposed to be or how to pronounce it, it's just completely different to the portuguese spelling
> For me it was Spaniard
For the longest time I thought it was a disgraceful word for Spanish people
Same for me with Spanish "chino". Always felt like a rude word for a Chinese person to me, but it really is just the Spanish word for Chinese
That sounds like a word a Portuguese person would make up as a joke
Espuma is Portuguese for foam
In Portuguese we have "negro," which is the same as "preto
" When referring to a black person I hear that, supposedly, one of these words is offensive and the other is not
I honestly don't know which is supposed to be and which isn't.
Yeah, that's the definition in Portuguese (chá/infusão) and English (tea/infusion)
If it doesn't have the tea plant in it, it's just an infusion or herbal tea, technically
In portuguese is similar to your alternative, Aleluia
Porque «chino» em português pode aportar uma conotação pejorativa
Se bem que nem é uma expressão comum de se usar por cá.
I saw them in stores and would usually take them home
Never recieved one in the mail though
I usually got one in my mailbox around early september or so
Not real mail mail, just an unwrapped, unaddressed catalogue their distributors left in my street
Usually
I do not remember if I got one this year or not
Surprisingly useful though of course I understand why they stopped, on the last clear out we must have thrown away 6 catalogues or so
Here where I live, in North Litoral Portugal, this year has actually been the opposite
The 2018/19 winter was freezing, particularly cold, though it was very dry
The summer was very wild, I can count on my fingers the days that registered +30 degrees celsius, and August was a bit rainy
Really I always thought this was a French thing
Here in Portugal u can tell French tourists by their Goose down  jackets all year around
Heck when my French friends who live in Lisboa go to the movies with us they bring their down jackets and scarves
It gets cold here
Sweaters,  jacket and scarves but only for 2-3 months rest of year pleasant
Not at all
( Unless those times we lose against Germany on European / World cups)
I personally don't have any problems with Germans
Someone's home country doesn't matter, their views might, depending on what they are
I've also never heard of anything negative about them here, but I'm not social nor go out much
We dont have an anti german sentiment
As isolated as we are the only sentiment we have is towards our spanish neighbours
It was definitely a strong sentiment around 2011, give or take
And it was obviously directed at Germany as a state/government, not the people
Still, it has kind of died out now
Like the other user said, we only hate playing against them in football [because we'll lose :(]
I thought [Misako] – meaning: my bag, but written in a different way – was Japanese, it’s Spanish
I thought exactly the same
Rockstar Games is based in New York City, and is a subsidiary of Take-Two Interactive which is also based there
Rockstar North is the developer of the main Grand Theft Auto games and is based in Edinburgh
The series was created by DMA Design, which was Rockstar North's original name when they were based in Dundee (sidenote: hey also developed Lemmings
Rockstar Leeds is responsible for the handheld spin-off games Liberty City Stories, Vice City Stories and Chinatown Wars
They aided in the development of the main games as well if I'm not mistaken
And I thought it was Turkish
I thought it was British
TIL
I have read an article and it said that, to a degree it’s almost gibberish
IKEA on the other hand, couldn't scream it any louder
not that I mind though, meatballs are awesome
Sorry for my ignorance, but who is Bernie Sanders
Ah, ok thanks
Edit: Answering the question above i would say that it is working quite good tbh, im not big on those stuff but noone is complaining so that's gotta be good right
I live in an Atlantic Island , the main type of rock is basalt and water is abundant especially on the northen coast and on the Mountains
As the water is has not many minerals it is good to drink if you have kidney stones and is not poluted because there is not much industry
If you came here, I'd offer you water in a bottle
But it's actually tap water that I put in a bottle to put in the fridge
This is common in Portugal
I always drank tap water, I think most of us do here
I drink nothing but tap water
Can't remember the last time I bought a bottle of water
I think most people consume bottled water here
I do, and so does everyone I know
but I have to admit most of the time the problem's not with the water itself but the tubes, lol
It's the norm, I'd say
Bottled water is for when you don't have access to tap water or when it's easier to drink from the bottle at that moment
but when the latter's the case, it's often personal bottles with tap water
At least in the places I've been in my country, tap water is great, so I assume that's the norm nationwide
I actually feel bad now for the countries with shit tap water :/
Tap water is the standard in Portugal, I only buy bottled water when I need it on the go
In Portugal i lived near a spring so I would just get it from there
It was beautiful
In England I started using Brita because both tap water and bottled water where really horrible in taste (almost as bad as Spanish bottled water)
Blue that I'm in Italy I still use Brita but my in laws but bottled as they mainly drink sparkling water for some reason
It was weird to me how common sparkling water is here
Tap Water in Portugal is top notch quality, fortunately
I and a lot of people I grew up with in Portugal weren't connected to municipal water services, the water came from a well and was unsafe to drink
Now we are finally on municipal water but my parents still don't trust it
Now I live in the UK and I even use my Brita to rinse my hair in the end
Most of my compatriots are saying that consuming tap water is the norm
But not in Alentejo and Algarve definitely
Here the water is very bad because it comes from small lakes next to the farmlands and they use a lot of chlorine to disinfect it
Also the water is very hard, as you can see in the image . [The red stands for hard water]
Grew up always drinking tap water
The tap water in Lisbon has a really weird taste to me (it’s perfectly safe to drink though) so I just got a Brita filter when I moved there
I think bottled water is a scam honestly, and only buy it if I’m out and about and get thirsty
Neither is common
Instead of fridges having a built in water dispenser, we put tap water in a bottle and put it in the fridge
I never buy bottled water unless I'm traveling, but it's pretty common to go to a friend's place and they offer me bottled water because they don't think tap water
I think if you drink only tap water since you're a kid you just get used to it, and vice versa
I think it depends on the region and piping, when I go on vacation to the South I am advised to not drink the tap water there
Bom saber
Eu pessoalmente não conheço ninguém que beba água do cano, mas se calhar depende da região.
For me it happens basically everyday
Worst thing is when I'm trying to explain something to my parents and I can't find the word in portuguese (they know almost nothing in english so saying the actual word I'm thinking about doesn't help)
Very frustrating ahahah
It happens to me quite a lot, mainly in things related with my field of study (Finance) since I have learned most of these words in English
Happened to me a lot, so I pledged to give way more attention and care to my native tongue
Very rarely, and it's sad to see so many of you forgetting your native language
Too often
Now I'm in a weird situation where I'm not very good at speaking english but I speak english so much that I mix english words with portuguese words
&#x200B;
So now I suck at both languages
Never call us Spanish
And don't try to speak spanish in Portugal, it is better to speak in english instead
Never, never call a Portuguese person , Spanish
Don't you dare
Foregneirs talking in Spanish to us, instead of english (or portuguese)
It's way more common than you may think, and it's just plain offensive and stupid, especially when both people involved know that you're Portuguese and both speak good English
It mostly happens because either they think Spanish is our language or that is similar enough that we understand it better (and most times they speak trashy Spanish to you)
It's just plain offensive
Only the portuguese eat codfish
Any other codfish is fake codfish
Do not disrespect codfish
If it's the first time you come here, and see codfish, just say it's very good and you've never seen it before
Uhm, such culture, so good
Keep it at that and get ready to hear 50 facts about codfish
Not being polite
If you are asking for directions, say hi first, if you’re entering a small shop, say hi, say thank you if someone helps you
Being cordial is very important
Don’t bring that “the customer is always right” attitude here, everyone will just think you are rude and entitled
Also, don’t speak Spanish to us
If you know Spanish we can probably understand you and most people will try to communicate anyway, but just make it clear you’re not assuming the languages are the same
Portugal is a very old country, with a very strong national identity
We get a bit sensitive about people just merging us with Spain because we’re a smaller country
In the Madeira and Açores islands - saying you are coming to/from Portugal (portuguese ppl from continental Portugal are the main offenders)
Being a foreigner and criticising Portuguese culture or food
(Big inferiority complex)
Calling an adult that you are not close friends with, that has college degree, without mentioning his "title":
- It's Doctor (or engineer or architect  etc) Manuel, not Mr
I think it's not a problem at all to speak Spanish, the problem assuming we speak Spanish
My Spanish is crap
I'm 1000 time more comfortable speaking english
Lol, my gf is Ukranian
I was with her dad in the car and had just bought some flowers
He looked at it, picked it up, threw one out of the window, put it back and just went "you'll thank me later".
It was confusing as hell
TIL portugal and italy share basically every NO NO, except for the "gesture americans do to mimic italian"
Hey there
So, you guy are, liKe bRaZiliAn rIgHT
Wait, serious question, how's Poland not eastern european
It's literaly at the eastern edge of the EU, you've got ukraine east of Poland, and then that's straight onto Russia
Or is it more not "culturaly" eastern european
Thank you, I didn't knew
I put ketchup on pasta and my italian flatmate filmed me doing it (with my consent) and posted in on instagram stories with a dramatic instagram sound
I hate tomato, that's why I don't use regular tomato sauce
I don't mean to be disrespectful
It confuses me too
Spanish and Portuguese are very similar tho
It's just not appropriate to speak Spanish in here
It's like trying to speak Russian in Finland
Just don't pls
It is not advisable
Sou portuguesa
Wait
Americans talking to italians in Spanish
Uf, you had me scared for a moment
As long as it's portuguese-made codfish from norway eaten in London we are alright ahah
Yeah, I meant that
You did
I was being a bit hyperbolic before, I figured codfish was just the translation for bacalhau
Yes, we are aware of fake and inferior "codfish".
That's true
Even if you get a lot of confused faces it's definitely possible to communicate
I've had a situation where I tried helping an Italian lady get a train in Portugal and our way to communicate was saying me saying words in Portuguese/Spanish and she saying words in what sounded like Italian/Spanish
As if Spanish was the middle term language between us two
This is key: portuguese people are used to tourists and the fact that they don't speak portuguese, so a lot of us so speak simple English
Yup, that's why I mentioned Russia
Well taken as the literal geographical distance from the Ural mountains then the whole EU is made up of western european countries, and Ukraine might as well be central european ahah
At any rate, that would really not say mucy about it culturally
I bet its that little retardospanish, as people that actually speak it probably would have sense that the languages are different
Yes, I wasn't trying to argue with you, I meant to emphasize a part of your comment
That's important - we never dub movies
Except movies for kids (we call those the "portuguese version") and commercials, everything that goes on tv or the movies is subbed instead
In Spain they always dub their movies
That may explain why such a large percentage of there portuguese people is comfortable with English
We were the second European country with less babies being born in the last few years, the first one being Cyprus
On average, a Portuguese woman only has 1
3 babies her entire life which in the future is going to become a big problem for our population
Who else wants a JSF reboot
Portugal also finished last in the first year participating
With 0 points
(1964)
A good curiosity about that entry it is that its name was "Oração" (Prayer) which is exactly the same name of the song that represented Serbia in their first participation ("Molitva") and they ended up winning (2007)
You might think that, but if you take that Portuguese first place, we are by far the wors team ever in Eurovison
Even when we organised the contest, we were last
We have several 0 POINTS
Olympics but better
that's exactly it
Oh I don't think it's that much of a bad thing but they expect that by 2100 portugal will only have 5 million people (half of the current population)
4-5 euros is pretty expensive for Portuguese standards
I was about 9 years old and an old black man started secreaming at me and my friends on our way to school "killers, you destroyed my country" but I guess  he was just old and demented
Brazilians are the same with us
"You destroyed my country". Saying this to the people who unwillingly fought to keep Soviet and American milícias out from their countries
Now the cold war is over and they're left with Soviet weapons and corrupt Soviet style governments
I hate it every time a former colony blames Portugal for their ills, when we tried so hard to fix the shit we did there
I agree, but he was just an old fool
I think most of Angolan, Cape Verdians Mozambique are thinking about their full corrupt government and missing the Portuguese
He ransack my country, particularly my city, and pillaged many works of art
But he also brought about the concept of conserving fish in tin cans
Let's call it a tie for Portuguese culture
I am Portuguese, my grandma is 97 and still drinks a cup of wine every meal
Maybe that is the secret
Just kidding, but the easy going life, living outside big cities and eating from the ground has direct relation with that
Live to work or work to live
To me the most important variable is how in your  culture you see food, if a physiological necessity or a social moment
Honestly, even we have a better live expectancy than England, economic differences are clearly irrelevant to the topic, atleast when comparing european countries
I think those differences you said apply to any southern/mediterranean type country when compared to the british tbh (great comment btw)
Haha no problem, i know, didnt mean to criticize :)
The concept is base on punishment of humiliation, but i don't think that it will diminish the number of speeding violations, the risk to reward racio is really not that good, at least from my perspective has law student, the risk (being caught) is low enough for insensitive the reward (speeding)
So I don't think it will work has good has a fine or prison time, I might be wrong though there's other info that i don't have (like how good are Estonian police at watching the roads and capture the people violating the speeding laws)
The annoying thing is the people speeding passes a yellow light and everybody behind must stop
Or if you are driving under the speed limit and the light turns red and you must stop
I went to a private high school in England and we had a muck up day
Mine was pretty tame but a few years before us the graduating class bought three hamsters and painted the numbers 1, 2, and 4 on their backs before releasing them into the library
The librarians searched for hamster number 3 for hours before the kids told them what they'd done
Not a film or series, but I played recently Battlefield V and one chapter was in Norway and I found Norwegian to be a pretty cool sounding language
They suppose to be mother and daughter
Both of them have different dialects
Seems a bit of a oversight
i legitimately thought that was german or something
That makes sense
In my grandma's home village there is not many people so i greet them, but when iam in my true home, i dont greet all the people because i live in a city, i wouldnt mind, but it would be very strange for other people
Fucking Bullfighting
-The way we Portuguese drive, apparently for people outside they think we drive like we are in a rally race
-Drinking in public outside in the street
-1h or a bit more of lunch time
Owning land just for the sake of it, like people who own land don't usually plant anything (other than natural vegetation like pines, etc
) they just own it to say they own it
I know this happens a lot here, specially in the the more rural parts of Portugal
At least ours is not has cruel has the Spanish one
Still horrible tho
Fuck bullfighting
Hmm, I guess you need a good method of natural selection in order to live in the north
And while they're young, wastes less resources
I approve
Man you guys should really change your timezone
Spain, brother,... Porque
When I moved to the uk I thought this was soooo weird, that and giving me paper to clean my hands after I wash them and asking for a tip, so bizarre
T'is indeed a Mediterranean skill
I have no idea, for me it's a national shame
I believe it's only a minority (with money and power) that enjoy it
True but some other Europeans share that problem has well at least from what i hear
But true Americans have the biggest problems with drinking in the streets
Our is not total is parcial
Basically it's not punish through penal methods but instead by counter ordination
Only crimes linked to drug trafficking and selling is punish through penal methods
But in practice people rarely get a counter ordination punishment
We don't kill the bull nor hurt him, we just dodge while dancing until the bull gets tiered
Edit i explain it a bit wrong, my bad, we do hurt them but not with the same method, which is a bit less cruel but still cruel
I'm sorry
I didn't want to miss lead, it was a gap in knowledge from my part
We're one hour behind, like the UK
It gets poked with metal skewers during the horse bit and there's blood all over the bull, pretty sure that counts as hurting it
"à grande e à francesa" (big and french-like) - something incredible, glorious, epic, etc

Ver-se Grego- To feel Greek, idk the origins but it means to see yourself having dificulties in something and not neing able to acomplish something
I've heard this one but idk if it's as common, Ver à Espanhol(something like that), basically see things like a Spaniard, it's used to refer people who "see" things with their hands aka they ask to see something but go around touching instead
When someone is always punctual we say they have "English Punctuality"
"Ver à Espanhol" or "Looking at things like a Spanish" which means touching the object you're looking at
There's one in Portuguese, that refers to the French
It is used when referring something done in a big scale, fancy way or exuberant  way ( like a party or event)
"À grande e à francesa" (Big/ Large scale and French)
“Levas uma pêra que vais parar à China”. To take such a strong punch, you’d be projected across the globe
Popular expression among kids back in the 90’s
Same in Portuguese
Dude, cheer up
In portuguese, "Espanholada" means titty-fuck
We have the Trojan Horse reference as well in Portuguese
"Trojan Gift" is sort like a poisoned gift
We also have "pernas à chinês" (legs like the Chinese) - when you sit on the floor with your legs crossed
Wow
I learnt some
Very good compilation
Maybe the "relógio suíço" would mean something more like a machine that works perfectly
True
Completely forgot that one
Now that you say it, I see that you're right
I'll correct it
Thanks
Out of the loop, can someone fill me in about this guy and what's the situation exactly
Often, when a foreigner already has a thick accent and then approaches speaking brazilian portuguese
There's only so much I can unpack from there
Sometimes it's just easier to default to english, rather than having to interpret an unfamiliar accent in an unfamiliar grammar setup
At least with english, the grammar setup is always a bit more familiar
Well we Portuguese people ironically are a minority in the Lusophone world so yeah, there are some easy and hard accents
even in Portugal itself, ahem ^(São Miguel accent)
In Azores, Portugal, in the biggest island (São Miguel), they have a very specific accent that is very hard to understand to any portuguese that is not from there
I have been there twice and sometimes I would talk to locals and could not understand a word
In certain ocasions I would just give up and excuse myself for not understanding
When a journalist does interviews with people from there they normally put subtitles
It is crazy because it is portuguese but only they understand each other and portuguese people from other regions really struggle to understand it
We speak the same language
This happened to me
Trying to understand an American with an Alabama accent, trying to say "hello, how are you
" in Brazilian Portuguese was the worst
People from Madeira with a thick accent also
It took me a long time to realise that the unstereotypically short, hairy Russians I saw speaking in a museum in Ireland were just Portuguese as well
When you're not expecting Portuguese and just get the sound of it and not the words to parse, it really does sound slavic
Same in Portugal: "You will end up flipping burguers at McDonald's."
We also have some gendered versions
If you are a boy people say you will end up working in civil construction carrying buckets of cement or if you are a girl you will end up working in cleaning (physically hard jobs that pay very little)
Almost the same, mcdonald’s or supermarket (a specific one)
For us in portugal they say we will end up working at a supermarket
Cashier (caixa de supermercado) or construction (obras)
Garbage Collector, Street Cleaner, McDonalds, Supermarket cashier, "Trolha# and "Carregador de baldes de Massa" (Ciment bucket carrier) (both semi-pejorative terms for construction workers), etc
the list is long
Yup
"Se não estudas vais para as obras" was pretty much the go-to for my parents
That reminded me of that "taking an IBM" joke as a fancy way of saying you're going to work in construction
(IBM stands for "Introdução aos Baldes de Massa")
and then you kept on jamming those lovely folk songs
I have a pretty cringey t-shirt with [this] on it (translation: "you should have studied")
Anything revolving Spain like:
- when did we become independent from Spain
we existed waaay b4 Spain was even a concept
- We speak Spanish or are a part of Spain
- Chouriço and Chorizo
I've had to explain to more than one person that, yes, our tap water is safe to drink
Like, wtf
Irl never had any situationike that
Online though, a lot of Americans for some odd reason think portuguese people aren't White but "hispanic/latino" mestizo looking people and can't grasp the fact that white people can have names like Pedro or Jorge
You do have winter all year around
Dude
Earning minimum wage full time in Norway is enough to put you in the top 1% by income worldwide
You "just" need to make 32400 usd/y or about 290k nok/year or 24
200 nok/month
That's not average
Exactly
23 degrees as high temperature is what have in December where I am from
Sure
But still, GDP numbers are already adjusted for PPP and you guys are always comfortably on the top
Besides, saving rates are what really matter
You can retire anywhere in the world, but other people can rarely dream of retiring in Norway
Save 20% of what you earn, and in 4 years you'll have as much money in the bank as the average Indian can expect to earn in a lifetime
The other way around doesn't really work
Anti vaxx should be illegal do the danger it poses to vaccinated population and the population that's physically incapable to get vaccinated
Its a dangerous for the public and the community, it infringes the dignity of the human person, the fiscal integrity of the human person and the right to health and medical care something that i know both the Portuguese and German constitution and the rest of the Constitutions of Europe share in common plus the fundamental rights protected by Lisbon treatie aka the EU treatie
There are so many bad translations here that you could write a book on it but the prize has to go to:
FRANCESINHA ( a fantastic adaptation of croque monsieur, with meat, ham and a spicy sauce - one of the best sandwiches of the world) - translated literally to LITTLE FRENCH GIRL
Edit: Forgot the runner up:
Punheta de bacalhau ( raw, seasoned, codfish with onions - quite good really) - translated as Handjobs of codfish
Well, not my country, and not europe
But once in china I saw: raped chicken with beans
Didn't try it, have no idea what the original translation was
But I always wonder about the raped chicken
Also: "Paper in toilet of your own consequences" was great
you get a medal
LOL
My favourite will always be goose barnacles, which are called "percebes" in Portugal and therefore translated as "understands".
Or a type of steak called "prego" and translated as "nails"
I'm also a fan of translating "come in, come in" to "between, between", since they both translate to "entre, entre".
> translated literally to LITTLE FRENCH GIRL
It doesn't, though
It's translated to "little french" with a female grammatical gender
It would most likely be translated to "little french sandwich", since it's grammatically female as well
Makes for smaller laughs, but it's more correct
Shall I mention those fantastic " Liver baits" - Iscas de fígado
I didn’t! Just check it out
Hope the future will be better
I like that Algarve region has a balance between a party tourist destination and a nature related destination (beaches and the countryside)
You’re thinking of casinos only, Las Vegas is also known for the strip clubs I guess
To be honest, you didn't destroy Algarve
Just Albufeira
The rest of Algarve is quite fine
It's ok
People tend to overreact about the tourist problems but it's way better to have people around instead of having a ghost town
Funny enough, some people give opinions about the tourists and how they behave really bad and so on, but usually they are not even from here
I think the majority of the people from here love the tourists
But I guess not all concentrated in one city like Las Vegas . And my guess is that they’re bigger and maybe Of better quality than the ones in Europe
I don’t know
It's not hot here 22ºC but at least its sunny today
This week's weather was kinda depressing 20 to 22ºC maximum cloudy and rainy with not a lot of sun
Here we're having the coldest month of June in the last 30 years
There were a few days where the temperature reached 30ºC but the weather is mostly foggy around 20ºC around here, which is not normal here
Specially when you have a month of May very hot (around 35ºC in some places)
25ºC here
It's pleasant but not hot enough for me (for Summer atleast)
I find the weather to be perfect when I can use a t-shirt, shorts and flip-flops all day without feeling chilly
This usually happens around 30º. So for me between 28ºC and 35ºC is perfect
When the weather is above 35ºC it's not bad if you stay home
But it limits the things you can do outside so
Yeah we good
Just happy because until now we had coldish days, and we are finaly getting an actual summer climate
It's actually weird
Few last years in Portugal hot temperatures actually came earlier than this and by this time (at least in my city ) was hotter aka around  40 ºC
Tips and tricks: avoid using plastic as much as you can; avoid buying fast fashion items and focus instead on second hand clothing; eat less meat (as long as it is healthy); if you’re ordering stuff online from one website, try to order several items you want instead of one each time; shift paper napkins to cloth ones
I know this isn’t what you asked for, but it’s never enough to put it out there :D we all know this, but not a lot of people actually try to do these little efforts
Another cool thing I’ve been doing is buying food and goods in bulk; it’s way cheaper and zero plastic involved :)
This is how I deal with hot weather
- stay inside
- underwear only
- have the windows always open (unless the the sun is shining through that window, in that case close the window and pull down the shutters)
- 2L water bottle in the fridge
Last few days were very hot, but the temperature seems to have gone down slightly
The worst thing wasn't so much that it was the temperatures were high, but that the air itself was hot
I live relatively close to the sea so I'm used to there being a nice, cool breeze, but there wasn't much of that the last few days
I'm in Northern Portugal
What the hell are you guys talking about
We're having 20º maximum today, with rain
Four years ago Warsaw reached 43C around this time
I'm from Portugal and people couldn't understand why I was dying and would sit in the bathtub during the day
I discovered I sweat from places I didn't think possible
It is weird reading this as a Portuguese because sometimes (at least where I live) for a few days in Summer we have 40-45+C and that 28 to 30C temperature comes almost every week since like end of May until maximum September or beginning of October( with like only a few exceptions)
I would rather not jump into my local river, the Thames
I live in Porto, in the North
It's weird how we are almost in July and I still need a blanket to sleep
Went to the beach on the weekend but haven't had much of a chance to do so during the week
I usually drink my water at room temperature but have been keeping a lot of bottles in the fridge and freezer recently
It's uncomfortable, but I've lived through worse
Thank you though
I don't know if I count but I'm Azorean, not exactly half way around the world overseas, I feel very connected to the mainland and so does most of the people here, I'm sure there are those who are very anti mainland but those are few and far between
However, we do have a bit of a "Texas attitude", I don't so much because I'm half Azorean from another island I feel very connected and my dad's side is Northern Portuguese which I also feel very close to and grew up with people all over the country on a military base
We have developed our own traditions many of which are actually mainland ones that fell out of place over time, we're a lot more Catholic, our food is a bit different, we have a much bigger cuisine from the sea for obvious reasons and we also have more cows per capita than the mainland, I kid but I'm probably right
All in all, we're closely related to the mainland but with lots of tweaks caused by 2000km of water
I’m from Madeira
I believe we are very different from continental Portugal and I believe people often think we’re our own country - not that we dislike Portugal but madeirans really want to decide stuff for themselves which isn’t the best at times
Mainlanders from Lisbon, for example, know the meaning of words used in northern portugal but don’t know the meaning of words used in the islands
The only place in Europe that have tea plantation and volcanic islands
I'm Portuguese but never went to Azores nor Madeira but is kind of a dream because are for sure one of the most beautiful places in the world
For a lot of mainlanders, we know about Azores because of a comedian named Helfimed
It depends, A lot of words that Northern Portugal have, the Southern don't understand and vice versa
About Madeira, I think a lot of mainlanders (like myself) don't know much about Azores nor Madeira, that said, a lot of words that we don't understand
Pretty good if you have the money, we don't need much but the government sure does
Living conditions are all right but if you want choice when you go to the market for stuff in general you're better off ordering from somewhere else if you can, it's bad unless you have something very specific
If you've been to northern Portugal into a secondary hub it's very similar
I was in Barcelos months ago because of my brother and it was surprisingly similar, a lot more space but at the same time more crowded though, plenty of tall buildings, that's a big no no here
Also, the air is much better, not as pure but a lot drier
Excellent, Azores is better than Madeira
You can see the insides of some volcanoes in Terceira
Hellfimed as a very peculiar accent, from São Miguel
Other islands don't speak like that, the rest have a very legible accent
I'll just leave it at that
The central group is my favorite area of the Azores
there's tea plantations in European Russia and volcanic islands in Italy and Greece
and Azores aren't in Europe
They are islands in the middle of the ocean, they don't belong to any continent
Every island has their own thing to look forward to, mainly geography and food
I recommend the Cheeses from São Jorge, The sights and old infrastructures, dead volcanoes from the inside, the lakes of Terceira and São Miguel, climb the mountain of Pico and try their wine and cheese too, Graciosa is super tiny but they have a pastry so good it's worth a trip although you can buy them anywhere else and almost as fresh, I don't know Faial nor Corvo
There's a bunch to soak in and I won't spoil but just these few things are totally worth it
I'm in Terceira and in a really good day you can see the São Miguel on the south east side, Graciosa on the north side, and São Jorge and a bit of Pico from the west, these two line up if you ever get to drive on the fast lane (we don't have highways) on the way to Angra do Heroismo and in the sunset it's absolutely beautiful
The Central islands, Pico, São Jorge and Faial are very close to each other and it's great for a short boat trip across the channel
I'm mostly familiar with São Jorge and Terceira and biased for São Jorge because my mom's side is from there and I spend enough time to know it all but not enough that every year there's something undiscovered
You could easily spend a month on the central group and never get bored
There's also the festivities during the summer (this year is dead because of a microscopic killer beer), I can't handle crowds so it's hard for me to enjoy some of them but festivals with older people are really good, you hear a lot of gossiping, lots of old time jokes, lots of really good food
It's hard to pinpoint but the central group is a short trip away from each other so if you ever come here you can jump from one to the other if you want to explore the most
Most people have a very bare knowledge of English but it's easy to get by, a lot of stuff is written in multiple languages
DON'T start off by speaking Spanish to them, only do so in a last resort situation, it's as offensive as calling a Californian a snowflake
P.S. Make sure that your rental car has good brakes if you drive in São Jorge, it's a vertical piece of land surrounded by water, there's a lot of inclines and twists and plenty roads are 300ft above water on one side and a wall on the other
We never had issues but don't want to start now
Yes, there's plenty if you like detail
Close to my grandparents home there's the remnants of a church, just the bell tower nowadays
In 1808, a volcanic eruption sent lava down that area and according to lore it was the ceramic angels the Padre put there at the time of eruption that saved the structure
You can visit the site but can't get in
The angels are or were there, don't know if they were relocated
This is just a bit of fun history to know about the area
My late great grandma told me a late late grandparent of hers helped build the church centuries ago
Terceira has a lot of great stuff too and a lot of interesting history surrounding battles against Spaniards and the french and even the monarchs and republicans
If you give context to it, I guess not
But we live in a age of outrage, so I might be wrong
Anyhow, I am interested
Probably a blog
Edit: you can always have a blog and create a sub, of course
You could create a sub reddit and use bots and moderator to delete any political or hurtful comments
I would be interested in reading it
I second this, would love to read the diary
In the 17th century, father António Vieira said of the Portuguese "Para nascer, Portugal: para morrer, o mundo," (To be born in, Portugal; to die, the world), in a clear allusion to the adventurous spirit of the Renaissance Portuguese, that seems to echo the modern migrant Portuguese
In other countries you see some people with books
In Moscow subway train almost every one had a book
I visited Moscow a long time ago, right after perestroika
Probably
I carry my book on my phone, now
Maybe they do the same
Seixal, especifically [ bairro 6 de maio ] Hands down, the most ugly city (part of it) in Europe
Brutalist architecture can be very beautiful
Something about the honesty of its design
As far as i can tell from the skyline, thats just bad and generic construction, barely architecture
Unconventional answer but I kind of agree
Tourist hotels and apartments look god awful
And I hate the way a lot of holiday villas look
They try and go far a "rustic" look but they just look so tacky and lifeless
Radom should win an award for all things ugly
I think the answer to that is Universal Healthcare edit: typo

It's beautiful
Neat, I didn't know we had a translated version
Gay ones
Yeah, I'm glad you had fun, but I'm sure locals weren't very pleased with your behavior
It's not a matter of being offended by fun (and jesus, where in my comment was I so unpolite to warrant a "get fucked"?), but often tourists come to a place and forget that those places are supposed to be livable places for locals and that there are certain rules to follow
I'm obviously very aware that the user I replied to didn't mean any harm and, sure, the journey was short and probably at decent hours, but the issue is that in those touristic places, that sort of behavior is amplified and repeated by a lot and while one person misbehaving is not an issue, 100, 1 000 or 10 000 people doing that definitely is
A lot of tourists get drunk, make noise late at night and trash the places and they don't get to reap the consequences of those actions
They're not the ones who have to clean up the day after or need to have had a good night's sleep because they need to work the next day
What I'm saying is that it's possible to have fun and still not being a dick to locals
[This would be my choice to represent Portugal]
Manuel Pinho, former Minister of the Economy about 10 years ago
[Here's the story, the specific don't matter much
It does indeed
I love this photo
Seems to be in the middle of Lisbon, with manly shirtless men and typical portuguese "desenrrascanço". I can't find a good translation for this word (it means something like "halfass a way to make things work") but I feel this photo really is a good illustration of it
I honestly have never seen it in person, so I can't really say
Either way, we are not a Mediterranean nation :)
That works, but I think the english term implies a sort of dignity that I don't think our term envokes
More of a Romance language than anything
The Azores, which holds the most disenfranchised spots in the country, namely rabo-de-peixe
Being disenfranchised is not at all something I would feel sorry for the Azores for
If anything I would say it's the other way around, the Azores feel sorry for us for how media and turist centered the mainland is
Portugal did join the allies and fought in WWI
But most people outside of Portugal don't know this because the participation was not very big, just a couple of battles, with the battle of La Lys
There was also some German attacks in the borders of Angola and Mozambique, that were Portuguese territory at the time
Not really an event, but when the Knights Templars were being prosecuted and hunted down, our King Dinis proclaimed that Portugal would be a safe haven for any knights who wished to come
The knights changed their name to "Order of Christ" and thought they were disbanded for a few decades, the Order is the only living successor of the Templars
I could say almost everything
Portuguese history is not very well known outside Portugal besides the period of discoveries
The 1828-1834 Civil War, also known as the Liberal Wars
My city (Porto) was under siege for 13 grueling months and it's such an integral part of our identity
25th of April
It was the day when our dictatorship was taken down
Idk much about it, but if some can explain I'd appreciate it
Just one thing, Hitler wanted Franco’s help, but Franco was the one who refused
We may forget the war but we'll never forget the Baker
Good old times, when a little army of 6
6K Portuguese in a *Táctica do Quadrado* and a *Padeira* defeated 31K Castilians
I doubt more than 1% of portuguese know about the battle of Almansa or Toro so there's that
Each state creates it's own national mythological narrative
>90% of the time when I say that I'm from Slovakia the immediate response is "ah, czechoslovakia
There's this number thrown around here in Portugal that 60% of americans think Portugal is part of Spain, which is problably the most offensive thing you can say to a Portuguese
So don't worry about it
Ignorance is not distaste or disliking one's culture, it's just ignorance
I mean there's a saying involving Almansa but I agree with your point
Yes and they (and I think colonial troops) weren't allowed to parade the Champs Elysée with De Gaulle
The reverse question: *what is illegal but doesn’t feel like it*
And the answer is peeing in the ocean
Drugs, widely and successfully legalized, nevertheless highly frowned upon
Always felr awkward using a big Lidl bag in another supermarket
Yeah the least you could do is buy the cheapest thing available
Excuse me
Can I have the law number
asking for a friend
They're still illegal in Portugal, just decriminalized
I will report you to the police
Buy GME
There are several regulamentos municipais in a number of localities, that forbid public urination
[sources] [source] [source]
I couldn't find a single one that mentioned the ocean specifically
I did find a few foreign websites that claim that we have this law, but they didn't cite any sources and appeared to be quite lacking in credibility
Probably to help the environment¿
Sure, but you're not getting arrested for consumption
I still do, I don't get what people like about beer
Now whiskey, that's good shit
The word "Saudade" only exists in Portuguese
Feeling of longing and missing something/someone
“Saudade” is a untranslatable Portuguese term that refers to the melancholic longing or yearning
A recurring theme in Portuguese and Brazilian literature, “saudade”refers to a sense of loneliness and incompleteness
The word "saudade", which means to miss someone, but in portuguese it takes the form of a common name and not a verb
Portuguese has "dígrafos" which are like your "CH" letter
Examples are: CH, LH, NH, QU, GU, RR,....
I’ve always been fascinated by Czech because of that
Czech literature (especially poetry) must be very interesting
Ye, we also have the verb to "Desenrascar" or the proper Portuguese way of saying it "Desenmerdate" which roughly translate to "unshit yourself" which means to deal with the hand you're given
Example if you don't have the a screwdriver or a knife, use a pen glued to monopoly piece so that you can use it to unscrew a screw yk
The myth that gets spread is that the word "saudade" doesn't have a translation in any other language, but that is blatantly false
It just doesn't have a ***direct*** translation to ***English***, and even then it's just a case of English having a plethora of words that are more context-specific, while "saudade" encompasses all those meanings (longing, yearning, nostalgia, homesickness
Most other languages do have a word for it
Really
I suppose you don’t have you’re welcome either
Those contractions are not exclusive to galician
We also have them in portuguese
We have that too in Portuguese, -inho/-inha or sometimes -ito/-ita
And we can use it with adjectives too, not just nouns
Well, there's the Portuguese Fado that focuses a lot on the feeling of "saudade"
In Portuguese "dor" is pain, is it related
I think the closest translation to English of тоска is melancholy, which is a feeling more associated with nostalgia than saudade
Saudade is much more intense, even though the Portuguese use it quite often to describe missing something
Edit: I mean much more intense than nostalgia*
Summer Time, without a doubt
More sun in the evening is great
I would prefer it if they just left it as it is
If it must go to a single time all year round it should be winter time because it's closer to the actual "sun time"
Murder it
Murder it
It is an aberration
Only the stupidest, most idiotic people could have suggested this shit instead of moving the time at which stuff starts; if you want to move it
It is unnatural and should be murdered with no remorse
Summer time as i prefer less light in the morning and more daytime at later hours
Summer time
Period
The early evenings really hit me hard and I hate it
Winter time definitely
Summer time is awful because when you wake up is still night and then you have sun until like 10 pm, which feels really unnatural
Winter time definitely
Leaving work or school at night hurts your mental
As long as they stop the twice a year jumps, any will do
I hate these changes, and sometimes they really hit my sleep
I would prefer the winter time, it is closer, but still 40 minutes ahead of the solar time where I live
Also makes it easier to enjoy or use early mornings
Either
I just want to stick to one time
Every time change I feel groogy and have headaches for a week
I'd like for Portugal to keep summer time and Spain keep winter time
It would get rid of that ridiculously late solar noon in the summer in Galicia and put us in the same time zone
that long
I usually only notice the difference on the following monday
i.e. Today
This, and move the office hours up/down if need be
I like the base GMT is neat to calculate other timezones
I know it's not much, but in winter the sun here sets at 17h20 or so
When I leave at 18h is already dark
Although it's not much, but I would appreciate if the sun set at 18h20 instead
In Portugal I definitely want GMT+1 forever
I think most of the Portuguese people do to
For me it's an all week
I have a week long headache
Portugal ranks #3 in the Global Peace Index
#2 in Europe and #1 in the European Union (it goes, Iceland, New Zealend and Portugal)
It also feels that way too
In here, you won't get arrested if you consume drugs, you get treated and reinserted into society
You get, however, arrested for facilitating drug acess
Our revolution to democracy was mostly non violent
(There was only like 3 deaths)
All the rest went pretty peacefully
Not to mention it was literally flower themed (red carnations)
I would say Portugal beat you by a year :)
> [They] were granted n-word pass from Haiti president
The WHO was not involved
That is wholesome
One thing that pisses me off here is that I still know a lot of people who go out of their way to buy purebred dogs (usually German Shepherds, Jack Russels and Beagles)
The London
Paris  but with all the chavs mafia eastern Europeans
The [Santa Justa Lift] in Lisbon
It's just a lift
Okay it's actually quite pretty, but I really don't get the queues of people trying to get in
A lot of downtown Lisbon is becoming a tourist trap I feel, at least that's the impression I get these days compared to when I lived there
In Edinburgh there are a lot of tacky tourist-focused shops near the castle
They sell stereotypical Scottish souvenirs and merchandise and have really obnoxious bagpipe music playing on shitty speakers
Pastéis de Belém. They sell pasteis the nata near the Jerónimos convent in Lisbon, it's a very touristy area
However most of the tourists don't know that they don't need to be in line outside for hours, they can just go in sit and have table service, the place has massive sitting areas inside
Adding to this, pastéis de Belém sell really nice pastéis de nata but they are small and expensive, there are other places in the city with same quality if not better
The city of Albufeira on the Algarve region
It's a really bleak city
Only houses and resorts, crowded beaches and stupidly high prices
It's what we call a tourist money grinder
If you are visiting the Algarve, don't go only to the places everyone goes (Albufeira, Portimão, Vila Moura)
There's an entire beautiful region to explore: the historic cities of Silves, Tavira and Olhão, the Fortress of Sagres, the historic villages of Vila do Bispo, Aljezur and Castro Marim, the pombaline city of Vila Real and the nature of Costa Vicentina and the Espinhaço de Cão, Monchique and Caldeirão Mountains
And I'm not even talking about the paradise that is the Ria Formosa
It is literally called the portuguese Maldives, with Cristal clear waters and white sand
And the best of all: no tourist crowds and super affordable prices
The best tip to have an amazing time on the Algarve is: don't visit only the famous places
Yes they are beautiful, but there's so much more waiting to be seen
Edit: typos
The [Padrão dos Descobrimentos ] although it is a good homage to the Age of the Discoveries, there is really no point in going up on top
There's also some people in Lisbon who will approach you to try to sell you marijuana, but it is mostly fake
When I went there it was during Winter and not too crowded fortunately
The hotel where I stayed nearby was also great and had the best breakfast buffet I've ever seen
I ate so many different types of bread
I went there an year ago in May and didn't find too crowded
Absolutely loved the city but did experience people selling me shit all the time near the Eiffel Tower  and a man tried to forcely give a bracelet to my girlfriend (I looked extremely mad and he left us alone)
Still, the nicest place I've been at and I didn't think it was that expensive, as long as I didn't order beverage and just drank the free water
Os pastéis de nata em Lisboa são bastante inferiores
Agreed
Went there 2 years ago
Loved Romania, Bran castle was definitely the least favourite part
I lived two months in The Hague but ended up only going to Amsterdam one day (to visit Van Gogh's, Heineken Experience, Adam's Lookout and the red light district)
I don't know if it's because I didn't really go to where I should have gone but the city honestly felt so underwhelming when comparing it to The Hague or Delft
Did I miss something
I’m Portuguese but from madeira and everytime I see padrão dos descobrimentos I’m blown away
It’s beautiful
At least there's a Wagamama nearby
What about the self proclaimed republic in Vilnius, Uzupis
When I was there kinda felt like a tourist trap
Haha I can sort of agree
Back when I was writing my dissertation last Summer I was glad I lived just outside the Fringe's limits
Had to get some things done in the city center before I left at the beginning of September and it was absolute hell
Yeah, it's a thing in some areas of Lisbon
They target turists, it's all fake drugs
Check:
It's not pricey for Portuguese standards, it's just that you get pretty much the same quality and bigger for the same prices in other places
And they are always warm also, like Manteigaria
How long is a block
Como assim
A parte de fora
Mas não vale a pena subir
(Talvez não fui claro no comentário :/)
Yeah, it's usually just parsley or oregano
Oh my, I was there
Os pasteis de nata que se vendem em Lisboa são overrated e overpriced
Tornaram se um bocado como os éclaires do Porto
Há sítios em Lisboa onde não são assim tão caros
I am an introvert and don't like football
However I have beard and eat bacalhau
Physically no, I'm tall, blonde hair, green eyes with fair skin, I do get a great tan tho and I do have a beard
I love village parties, love pimba, love talking with people, drink more coffee than I drink water, love beer and wine, like parties, love the Santo António party, but I do not love football but I watch some games and get into the spirit and sing my heart out our nation anthem
So I think I fit some cliches
Edit: forgot the most important thing, my name is Zé
Is having a beard a Portuguese stereotype
Oh god, the football
I have the sense that it used to be worse though
Maybe I just managed to gradually get away from the football-o-sphere
The football tho
If you like bacalhau and at least are able to choose a football team to preferer, even if you don't like football and have no particular reason to choose, you can get the pass for weird portuguese
I know right
Team bacalhau
It is a portuguese stereotype in Brasil to have a mustache
Basically looking like Quim Barreiros
I don't know I think it looks cool and I am too lazy to shave everyday
I sleep and eat at somewhat decent hours so I am not at your side of the border
Worse
Put the tv on after a game
10 channels analysing frame by frame every play in a game
Bacalhau for the win
༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ
Ah yeah, but that I just never see
I said that it seemed worse because growing up every adult seemed to want to make conversation about football + almost everyone my age talked constantly about it
As I tried to cut the conversation short, even at 15/16 (+/- 2008) it just bread amazement, and more questions as how I did not care
Now, I barely ever get anyone pushing football down my throat
I don't watch much tv besides the evening news, and normally turn it off as soon as football comes on (the last, more fluff, part)
I'd say the best part of football now is going grocery shopping when a big game is on
Streets and crowded places with Porto vs Benfica on are the best
And it barely ever seeps into conversation
Edit: one exception is my ukranian father in law
He doesn't speak english that well, really likes football, and doesn't know that much about PT
So he always asks how is Cristiano, and what I thought about his last game, to try and connect
The rare occasion I'll look at a game is before meeting him to be able to make conversation because he's a great guy
I didn't find a bacalhau, so you get the flag badge
Good job caralho
In Portugal bacalhau eats bacalhau
I think a lot of depictions of Europe in Hollywood movies fall into the trap of presenting it as either romanticized or backwater
There's a large amount of historical architecture over here, which I think has lead to the perception that we're stuck in the past
Not many portrayals of Portugal come to mind, but I do remember the Portuguese fishermen from Family Guy speaking with Brazilian accents
Also there was a trailer that released not too long ago for a French film called Opération Portugal which depicts immigrants and people of Portuguese descent very unfavourably
As in they're stupid and old-fashioned, but as it turns out have a heart of gold
Then again this seems to be the case with a lot of films/shows/stories depicting immigrant communities
In Love Actually the Portuguese are portrayed as a bunch of poor simpletons
Pretty much all of them
We're lucky if we get someone that doesn't speak with some kind of  Brazilian accent
Hell, even movies with actual Portuguese actors in them show us like some backward, third-world country/society (I'm looking at you, Love Actually
Fortunately we are part of Spain in Hollywood's POV, so we are spared by the Spanish stereotypes across the border
either that or we get represented as Brazilians with European seasoning
You thought that was bad
The episode where they visit Lisbon shows a BULLFIGHTING FESTIVAL WHERE THE BULLS RUN ON THE STREETS
Where did they get that idea from
We have bullfighting yes, but bulls DO NOT run on Lisbon's streets
It's my grandmother's favourite movie
She watches it religiously every christmas
Yeah conflating Portugal with Spain is incredibly cringey
Honestly I just wish these big productions would actually put some effort in their research and depiction of places
I get that maybe the average viewer they have in mind won't really care, but it's not that hard
They should at least try and get the accents and languages right
Ò yé, butchi ai schtili cán gô fó uóqueis im da junguel
And so on and so on
There is an accent for every language
I once saw a poster outdide of a Lidl that said "don't swap our babies". It also said to look into their Facebook page for more information and so I did
Turns out there are people out there who belieber the governament is swaping people's babies in hospitals in order to make them more acceptant of their power ir something
>Columbus
That's ridiculous
Everyone knows Columbus was a Portuguese spy born in Cuba, Alentejo, that tried to fool the Spanish king, accidentally discovering America
Copernicus ends with a S.
S is next to A in the QWERTY keyboard
Obviously, they accidently swapped the A in the end with the S at birth and weren't allowed to switch by the church since God snitched on them that he was gonna be a big bad heliocentrist
They added a U before the S, which the church allowed only because Copernics sounds weird and heretical
In the Latin world, names that end with an A are almost always( if not always) female
Copernica was a woman, obviously
Erasmus orgies, my friend
Neither, as I always write in uppercase
But If I had to write in lowercase, it would be "α". We learn cursive in school so I think the vast majority of people would write it like that as well
I mean carolingian miniscule was written by hand and that featured the "a". A lot of blackletter scripts as well
It's certainly time consuming however
People sometimes joke about uniting with the region of Galicia in northern Spain, which has historical and linguistic connections to Portugal, and as far as I know Galicians joke about this too
It's usually pictured as a friendly union rather than a conquest, but it's kind of at the expense of Spain
There's really frequent jokes involving a rivalry with Spain and defeating them in battle, which is kind of a recurring and somewhat romanticised event throughout Portuguese history
Now there's also this whole thing about Olivença which turned into a bit of an internet meme in recent years
This is a town which Spain conquered during the Napoleonic wars but is still officially claimed by Portugal
I feel like it used to be sort of a "fun fact" kind of thing but I think all the references to it in internet culture have made some people take it kind of seriously
There's also these dumb "Angola is ours" memes where you can't tell anymore if people are mocking the fascist regime in a tongue in cheek way or actually showing sympathy towards it
Feels like the former is turning a bit into the latter as time goes by and as some far right political opinions are starting to take hold in Portugal
In Portugal  we say that Olivença (in Spain that should be ours) is ours and there’s also a few people that want to get Galiza part of us (they probably want it to ngl)
As a portuguese, so many
Olivenza comes first to mind, Galicia (even though is not a reconquest but we kind of see them as close brothers), the parts the UK took at the Pink Map Ultimatum and basicly every former colony
And sometimes we joke about conquering the world and bringing the Fifth Empire to life
Really
Hahaha xD
I think in general we are selective, we just vote for one that we like
About commenting depends, some probably say to eat some tapas or to give Olivença back xD
Olivença é nossa
Give it back
( we'll also gladly accept our brothers and sisters from Galiza, but that is not rightfully ours)
Loool good luck
The Olivença thing is so overused and annoying tho
Like half the time you see a Spanish flair here there has to be some comedic genius replying "give back Olivença", it's so cringy
It's a small and insignificant town, who cares
Padeira de Aljubarrota has entered the chat
And the punchline is something like - " It seemed a good idea
how did it fail again
You tried a handful of times, ruled for 60 years, but not because you conquered us, and we fought back, just give up
, the Portuguese cannot be conquered
And Angola too ( also as a joke)
Olivença is definitely our answer to this question
For example:
Although, it's just for laughs really
I don't think anyone really cares
It's actually part of an euroregion now
(Source in wiki:
It's more like an internet meme, Portuguese people don't really care about Olivença a small town full of old people in Alentejo and the spanish also dont care about Olivenza a small town in full of old people in Extremadura
But if you give, but we won't say no
I notice that too
Olivença,  caralho
Yes  like I’ve heard many people say that the capital of Angola is Lisbon
coitados
Olivença you mean
You can keep her
But we start to make plans to reclaim Galiza, every time Spain football selection/a Spanish football team eliminate us from a international  football competition
Maybe some (cultural) blitzkrieg will change their minds
Coitados  o quê, Angola è nossa
(Sarcasmo)
Actually no
This part about olivença is because there is a real dispute between Portugal and Spain for the region
We also joke about Angola because there is a song, called "Angola é nossa
", angola is ours, that was created during the colonial war in the 70's, when Portugal was still ruled by the Dictator António Oliveira Salazar and the Portuguese colonies in Africa were trying to gain independence
That song, that is a patriotic song about Angola being Portuguese and that the Portuguese will never lose in combat and will keep the colonies, was recently turned into a meme
The other colonies did have anything to joke about, specially Macau, that was offered to the Chinese by Portugal very recently, in 1999, and willingly
Not worth the trouble
How is Gibraltar situation now, with the UK leaving the EU
You have a deal from my part
I only know abput it because of reddit
Not at all
Nope, nothing at all
Tipping, is just mind blowing how the employees depend on it, especially in restaurants
Metal detectors in schools
I know **why** they have them, but it will never not be crazy to me
Politics in the US are not confusing
There's plenty of available movies and documentaries about politics in the US, I'd say they're the most common
The only thing confusing thing is that you have crazy religious sects with aberrhant beliefs and then New York City and California, all in the same country
I always thought that wouldn't it be easier to control drunk driving if both the driving age and drinking age were 18
As it stands Americans can start driving very soon and getting a hold of alcohol before you can legally drink it isn't the hardest thing in the world
Meanwhile driving a car illegally seems a lot harder to pull off
I don't know, it just seems to me that it's easier to break the law by drinking when you're legally not allowed to versus driving when you're legally not allowed to, therefore increasing the driving age would prevent more cases of drunk driving
If I had a dollar for each time an American asked me "are Portuguese white or Latino
Tbf we do that too
Reminds me of the see-through backpacks idea that was spread around
I'm assuming that never really became a thing, did it
15 days for marriage ( no limit to number of marriages lol)
15 days a year for assistance to children
5 days for death of children, partner, parents, or in parents in law
2 days for grandparents, grandchildren, siblings or siblings in law
5 days for the birth of a child
Every absense due to school exams or court appearences
Any absence made by union representatives made to attend to union matters
Any absence made by a candidate to an election on the 15 days prior to the elections
Unlimited days for disease
All of these require proof of motive for absence
here you get the hours you need to donate off, not the all day
Caralho, is this for real
I had no idea and I live here xD
Paid leave for disease
Is this really like this
I understand if it is an work accident it can be paid but for a general disease I doubt it
Yep
My employer also gives us our birthday
First three days you don't get paid
Afterwards you get 55% to 75% according to
the number of days on sick leave
Same, but it's not very common
Are you getting those views from HLTV
Org
This might be biased cause I live here
But Tomar, Portugal is in my opinion still hidden a hidden gem, just 1 hour and half train ride from Lisbon
Apart from a major religious festival every 4 years, which attracts around 600k people  (if you are curious it's called " festa dos tabuleiros"), we are mostly hidden from the world
We have one of the oldest churches and one of the oldest synagogues in Portugal and also one of the biggest castles in Portugal,
Apart from the monuments it's a rather small town with quite old architecture, because it's so small you really don't need any transports
Food is inexpensive but rather good
I'm not really good at reviews tho and Im definitely not making it justice but if you take a look at my post history I have a couple of photos of it (sorry for the self promo)
Cáceres in Extremadura right
Went there on a school trip once and the museum was dope
Also Aracena in Andalusía is pretty and has cool caverns
I've noticed Dundee gets a lot of shit from people in Scotland
Ok not really shit, but a lot of people tend to describe it as boring
I've never spent that much time there but it looked pleasant enough
I also thought the V&A was cool
And apparently it's becoming a tech and gaming hub
In Portuguese the word for ass, cu, is pronounced the same way as the French word for neck, cou
Also the Portuguese word for dick, pila, can mean battery in Spanish
A lot of people think that the japanese word "Arigato" is related to the portuguese word "Obrigado" both meaning "thank you". However, this has been proven to be false
Found out the other day that the Irish Gaelic word for the stress sign is _fada_ (this in on itself means "fairy" in Portuguese)
The thing here is that they pronounce it as _fóda_, from what I gathered
_foder_ means "to fuck" in Portuguese, and _uma foda_ is something like "a fuck", one sexual intercourse, that is
It's kind of childish, I know, but I found this out the other day from an Irish guy named Seán, saying that is name was written "S, E, A fóda, N". It got me, the Irish guy and other Portuguese pals to finally understand that he was indeed talking about the stress and not about fucking the letter A.
We called it "fake friends", for Portuguese - Spanish one could make almost a book full of them
Some examples:Aceite (oil) -  Aceite (accept)
Embarazada (pregnant) -  Envergonhada/embaraçada (embarrassed)
Vaso (Cup/glass) - Vaso (Vase)  // (or even toilet in Brazillain ahah)
We also have puxe ( pull), which sounds like push in English
It's funny watching some people pushing doors instead of pulling
In Portuguese we write Caca but it's just the same shit
Well, there are literally dozens of japanese words with Portuguese origin
Check the list here:
Obrigado and arigato, both meaning "thank you".
Even worst
Borracho in Portuguese from Portugal may mean drunkard also, a species of bird and an handsome man

Regarding news I would say it's a normal amount of brazilian info
Maybe once a day
And usually it's things related to politics, like Bolsonaro doing something stupid or a protest
However, we are basically bombarded with brazilian soap operas
Every big generalist channel with the exception of RTP pass at least two brazilian soap operas after the night news
There's also a lot of brazilian music here, and most games are dubbed or subtitled in brazilian portuguese, which can be a bit uncanny for the average european portuguese speaker
And let's not start talking about the internet
Everything is from Brazil
Search for a recipe
Brazilian version
Searching about a law or regulation
It's gonna be the brazilian one
Searching about a translation for a word or phrase
It's gonna be in brazilian portuguese
The overwhelming doesn't come from news, but the rest of the media and info
Edit: typos
In Portugal we make an effort to remain connected to the rest of the Portuguese speaking world
We make cultural events, have their TV channels, etc
So it's not wonder that stuff happening in those countries always makes headlines
I think the Portuguese do worry about those countries
In the mind of most Portuguese people, they're also Portuguese
But it feels weird in the sense that we the Portuguese feel connected to Brazil (for example) but the majority of Brazilians know little about Portugal
Yeah, we should be able to filter out certain regions when doing a search
"-br" is your search friend
If you use Google, use "www
google
pt" instead of the default
You will be able to restrict results to "Portugal" from "Ferramentas". Not perfect but acceptable
At least on PC
and with Chrome
And to simply exclude a domain, add "**-**site:com
br" (in the case of Brazillian websites)
In Portugal, once someone said: To born, Portugal, to die, the world
I like the idea of living across multiple countries in Europe, and speaking the local language would allow me to do what I like the most: learn how the locals think
More recently, I would like to live in Iceland to experience their culture
In that case I would have to bring the sun with me
Either Germany  or Norway
Maybe not as prosperous as some northern European countries, but I would love to live in Italy
I probably have a narrow minded view of the country, but seems to be rich both culture and cuisine, and is generally quite beautiful
Probably Sweden
Maybe Italy or Germany, but admittedly I still perfer Portugal no place can't replace home
I am from Portugal
Speak English and German, can handle myself with spanish and Italian
Loved living in Germany and will visit as often as i can
I will never live anywhere else except Portugal
With all it's faults, i really love it here
Italy
Or Denmark
Also Netherlands, I lived in the Netherlands for a little bit but it gets impossible to meet people and consistently hang out unless you speak Dutch
Spain definitely, probably in Barcelona, but my second choice would be Italy
I’m Portuguese btw
Stay the fuxk away from (in summer) portugal one time I was visiting my dad their and had to stay overnight in a bus station cus of some transportation issues wake up to see my hand swollen as fuk I got bit my so many by mosquitos or whatever
Same boat
You forgot Portugal
On the upside, you live in a gorgeous country
Been there twice and can't wait to go back
What was your "they didn't realize I spoke the language" experience
Back in 2012, I went to visit my cousin in the UK along with my brother and other cousins
We were drinking a cup of coffee when a elderly woman sat in the table next to us, stared at us and said, rather loudly:
"These Russians are everywhere nowadays
We looked at each other in shock and then my brother turned to her, smiled and said:
"Actually were Portuguese, ma'am
The look on her face was priceless
Have you ever experienced something similar
Yes, in Poland a few years back
I mus say that my actions were fuelled by that arrogance you get when you think no one around you understands what you’re saying in your native language so you use and abuse it
I was with a couple of friends in line to buy cigarettes and we were talking in Portuguese
There’s this dude behind us that keeps eyeing us the all time
So I as arrogant as I can be say in Portuguese “What are you looking at
To what he responds also in Portuguese “I’m looking at you
” Awkward silence after that and then we ended up laughing about it
It was really embarrassing and taught me a valuable lesson
I don't have any funny stories
I just wanted to say that I expected that 1 in 3 responses to this thread were to be portuguese people
The OP is portuguese and the second most upvoted comment is from a portuguese
There tugas everywhere, EVERYWHERE
One time on a bus in Belgium this guy enters, having a phone call, very loudly and clearly describing his sexual exploits from the previous night with another man in portuguese
Couldn't help chuckling but I didn't say anything
He was probably another Portuguese person and was curious about you guys
Amigo tuga, já partilhei a tua estória no nosso estimado sub r/Portugal  !
She was speaking English, but we were speaking in Portuguese
I guess she thought we didn't speak English, the older generations don't in Portugal because back then they only learned French in School, but nowaday kids start learning it very early here
Not that she would know that, but if it had been my parents in that coffee house they wouldn't understand her
Are you pale-skinned and light-eyed
That's how I got mistaken for French several times in my country too
My friend and I had one too
In London, she was telling how hot the bartender was and that he had a nice ass
Turned out he was Brazilian and understood everything she said
She was so embarassed that we went back to our hotel
Yes and in hindsight my comment was really distasteful, thankfully we were able to laugh it out
I was young and stupid, but I’ve learned my lesson
I work a lot with tourists (I have a street food business in the local farmers market) and this week a family of Americans turned up and were discussing amongst themselves about who was going to order (I guess they thought I didn’t speak English)
The wife takes one look at me (I must have been smiling or something) and says to her family “I think she can understand us
”. I said that I understood them completely, to what they answer “Well, it’s a good thing that we weren’t talking smack about you then
Obrigada pela atenção caro compatriota
Felizmente o crescimento não se faz só para cima e para os lados e este caso foi um abre olhos para mim
It was
Luckily we ended up laughing about it
Looking back it was a distasteful thing to say
Join the recessive trait club, hermano ;)
No porno scenario in this case, I'm afraid
He stayed working, we went back to our hotel room and slept
Nice story though
My friend got married last april and her husband thought it was hilarious
This is Spanish
My parents have one and it's my favourite
I thought it was only a stylishly designed deck they found in a shop somewhere
I had no ideia there were different nationalities of decks and the most common was french
(just found out there is a Portuguese as well but very rare)
My experience in Portugal is that it is popular in some regions and others not
I remember people playing with it regularly in Trás os Montes, near Spain, and it was common
In Lisbon almost no one uses it and they found it very weird that I had it
In Portugal we use the French one but we call the types of card(nipes) ouros, espadas, copas and paus wich it looks like correspond to Spanish deck
I find this very interesting
Personally I have only seen french decks, there was a time I thought they were THE deck and there was no other deck
I live right beside you and I have NEVER seen such cards ever in my life
I never knew these existed, but TIL that our names for the suits are completely different from the images because of the Spanish deck
I never even thought about it
From Wikipedia:
> In Portuguese, the Hearts suit is called Copas ("cups"), the Spades suit is called Espadas ("swords"), the Diamonds suit is called Ouros ("gold coins"), and the Clubs suit is called Paus ("clubs" or "sticks")
You guys are our neighbors, and I swear I never saw those cards before
Cool post OP, brought me a lot of childhood memories, because those were super popular in here until the late 1990s. Now I don’t think they are, but also you don’t see many people playing cards in cafés or tascas
Yep, I also have one that looks exactly like that picture
It seems to be a miniature, though, as the cards are *tiny*.
Those were quite common until the late 1990s, when I was a kid a lot of people played with them, some actually prefer them to other decks
This already exists
Is it not the case in France
Most definitely
A lot of older people keep on driving up until the 70s-80s and are stubborn about it
It's dangerous
A BIG yes
A yearly test should be mandatory
My mom and I once had a car accident, because of an elder man whose vision was strongly debilitated
He was driving at 9 pm, and we had a head-on collision, as he was driving in our side of the road
Unfortunately, some doctors in Portugal do not seem to care enough to revoke driver licenses of elders that might not be able to continue driving safely, especially in smaller urban areas
We have laws that require a medical test after a certain advance age, if I'm not mistaken , I'm not sure about the age tho probably 65 or 70 years
Yes, and I cannot stress this enough
A few months ago, an elder man was tired of waiting for the railroad crossings to open and just passed by them
Needless to say, the train hit the car, killing not only him but his wife and their 10-12 year old granddaughter
Some old people can be stubborn and don't understand the notion of safety when it's told to them
Depends on the person, really
I have a friend who insists on wearing a T-shirt in the middle of winter
Personally, I'd say around 15-10ºC is the temperature at which I might want to grab a nice jacket
I'm really cold with 18°C weather
I'm going to Czech Republic for the winter
May die
Wish me luck
It depends on a lot of factors
A cold dry sunny day, -5/-10 is tolerable with the appropriate clothing
An overcast, windy and rainy day at 10 can be miserable even with appropriate clothing
It depends on wind, and it depends on predictions
I am in Lisbon, by the coast, and it is windy and you just know wind will pick up at sunset often and shady places might be windy
So this time of the year, if you are leaving home in the morning but returning later, you know you might be getting some wonderful hours at around 24 early afternoon but bits where it might be 13 and windy around 7-8pm
You bring a jacket, or hoodie or something
If the wind is strong even temps of 17-18, you want more than just a tshirt, even a long sleeved one
18°C. I don't like cold
It's a good thing that I live in a warm southern country
Here in Portugal everything below 10⁰C is extremely cold for me, giving that I live on the coast
I think the lowest temperature I've seen in my city was 2-3⁰C and it was on the new year's Eve
I could not even walk in the street in that night
But never snows here, unfortunately
Portugal entered the chat
Yeah, 5C is freezing my balls cold
Same thing for me here in Portugal
At 0° C all life functions cease
I've asked the question about politicians far more than about the cold, tbh
I can't believe PiS is bringing Poland back to the Middle Ages AND people are voting for them to do it
When it is above 30°c, you're in Algarve, not in the UK
Well, it's just the same with you people from the North and the heat
Guess you melt at 40°C ?
It's not just not being used to the cold, but you're cold EVERYWHERE
Houses are ridiculously poor insulated, so in peak Winter, if there's a sunny day, I sometimes feel warmer outside than inside because the walls haven't warmed up yet
I never had that issue when I lived in Poland, I started to feel like I could freeze when temperatures fell below -15 (or -5 if there was wind)
In Portugal
I'll be freezing if temperatures drop below 15 and there's a breeze
We have some places where it reaches below zero
Doesn't mean we like it ;)
Me too
You had close to that in 2010
37,2°C at Liperi
The most we ever had was 47,3° in 2003 at Amareleja, historically the warmest place here
Europe is a big continent
You are at 37 degrees latitude, which is like Faro, Palermo, Athens
It is a whole different ball game the far north, and summer is not so nice either, the too much light, the wrongness of sun angles is weird as fuck
Sorry for the personal questions, but did you grow up at lower latitudes, is your skin color dark
It is not normal for people who grew up in say southern Portugal to get depressed with the relatively small day time variation
If your skin color is dark, or even if it is not, do consider checking your vitamin d levels, and do consider upping your consumption of foods like fatty fish, liver, eggs and try to catch some sun on exposed skin (if your skin is dark, you are a vegetarian and/or cover your skin a lot, really really check with a doctor about vitamin d supplementation)
Also try to catch sun on your exposed skin in winter
I think it does a world of good
In Portugal "ter um par grande" has the same meaning of big balls, while "por os tomates de molho" means to not do anything, in essence being lazy
In Portuguese we say "ter tomates" (literally "having tomatoes", which is slang for testicles) which means being brave
If you want to say you're bored or lazy you can say something like "estou a coçá-los" (literally means "i'm scratching them [the balls]")
Grandes bolas, hmm I’m trying to find a more figurative meaning instead of large testicles
No there isn’t.
You already have money, why would you retire in Switzerland
In Portugal you have sun, good food, good wine and football, you have all you need to spend a retirement like a boss
Sort of
I tend to vote on the party that I believe is best for the current political/economical/social situation, though in terms of ideology I probably lean more towards the left
So if I think that the country needs a majority government I'll vote accordingly even if it's not the one I agree with the most, or if I think that we need more fiscally responsible policies in that situation (like during the 2008 crisis) I may vote more center
As for European elections I always vote Green parties because I think (though I may be wrong) that a lot of the environmental regulations/laws come from Europe and so I think that having a strong green presence in the EU is probably the best way to fight climate change
The only time I voted for a party I truly believed in was in the last elections and I kind of regretted it because what they wrote in their party manifesto was not at all respected by the chosen Parliament member, it was a bit of a scandal actually, but what can you do
“Portuguese smokers correspond to 20% of the population, with men having been smoking less and less, although they are the most smokers”
it was much higher in the past and unfortunately many teenagers still smoke outside of schools but luckily in general it is decreasing
The thing that annoys us the most is thinking we are Spanish or that we speak Spanish
We are older than Spain and we have resisted invasions from other Iberian countries for centuries
Also, sometimes brazilians will ask us to "give back their stolen gold". I understand that most of the time it's a joke but I have seen cases (and even met people who came to live in Portugal) where it seemed like they were talking seriously
Like, most brazilians are descendants of colonisers anyway so you shouldn't blame us who stayed here
Also, it has been proven the gold wouldn't fix the country's problems and even if it did, you've been independent for almost 200 years (congrats on that by the way
I know you've celebrated your independence recently)
Probably when a non spanish speaking tourist comes here and says "gracias"
Try thanking us by saying " Gracias".
We will melt at your feet, appaled by your wisdom and kindness
So you're Portuguese, right
- a tourist
Yes - a Portuguese
*proceeds to hit me across the ears with broken Spanish*
oh yeah, I know some Portuguese *proceeds to slap me with amazing Brazilian Portuguese"
Even I cringed
We would never ever confuse you
Or if anything we would be "Sweden
that thing next to Norway
". Sweden has no codfish
You are way more important to us
You do not get angry
You tut
You look
You sneer a bit
Somebody might say a polite passive agressive comment
Portugal is a very particular place in which we take queueing and their fairness very seriously and we are not inhibited at all to actually get angry in mobs at queue jumpers
It is a beautiful thing
Number issuing ticket machines everywhere where people queue trying to prevent chaos from occurring
Go to the supermarket
Take a number for the fish counter, another for the meat counter, or deli counter or bread counter
I think it's confusing in Portuguese:
First due to the whole Holland thing
Second because the actual name is the same as the low countries region: "Países Baixos". Which does translate cleanly to "Low Countries".
So, to recap:
Low countries - Países baixos (region)
Netherlands - Países Baixos (country)
Holland - Holanda (Netherlands region)
> proceeds to slap me with amazing Brazilian Portuguese
Yes
Annoying AF
But, to be honest it is still the same language so at least the gringo in question does know the difference between Portuguese (of both main flavours) and Spanish (Castillan for many of our Spanish Friends), and actually bothered to learn some of it
And, let's be honest, online the vast majority of Portuguese Language content is Pt-Br (A lot of us aren't aware of it, because we are used to only browse in English), and other folks really can't be expected to understand the difference between the two variants, and if they know there are differences they probably expect them to be similar to En-US vs En-UK, which, apart from bad spelling from the US part, is pretty much identical
It's also the "So you're Spain right
" for us
We do love to queue, if we see a queue we jump right in even if we are not sure why we are queueing
We actually consider it, on a day-to-day basis a different language
Like you might say "a link but it is written in brazillian", or ask a brazillian "how do you say that in brazillian
". True
Grammar and vocabulary is very different and functionally we distinguish their language from our language
(The other former colonies no, their portuguese is close enough to ours it feels the same)
Almost 48% of the brazilians are white and 43% are "Pardos" (misture of black and white
They have tanned skin)
Which means that almost 90% of the brazilian population as european ancestry, and most of them will have colonialist ancestry
That is what I meant
To be honest, most people here don't really care about it
We mostly navigate technology and entertainment in English or with (European) Portuguese subtitles
It's infinitely more infuriating in the rare cases where you pick a Portuguese flag and see Brazilian-flavoured text, because it's perfectly understandable, but hard to ignore
I imagine it would be the same with you guys and Austria, at least if what I heard about Schwarzenegger not being allowed to do his own dubs in German
Like, if you have someone speaking medical jargon in Brazilian Portuguese, it's very hard to not hear it as Brazilian Portuguese first and medical jargon second, because it's a bit funny sounding and distracting
I think this funny-sounding thing goes both ways, though, but I suspect we bump into Brazilian Portuguese more often than they do with European Portuguese, for obvious reasons
I wouldn't say we can't understand them
We definitely can
But it's just annoying
Nothing against brazilian portuguese, of course
It's just that, for us european portuguese speakers, brazilian portuguese falls into a kind of uncanny valley
We rather read it in english :P
>which is so different that the Portuguese can't understand them
It's actually the other way around
Brazilians can't understand us
And yes, it's a bit frustrating
>Portugal originated from the kingdom of Galicia
You mean Kingdom of León, which occupied more regions than just Galicia
>Spain primarily from Castile
Spain only came to be as a country in 1516 because the other Iberian Kingdoms united with each other
But it was not the same thing as Castille
You wouldn't say the United Kingdom is the same country as the kingdom of England (927-1707)
Portugal got it's independence from the kingdom of León, but this kingdom was not united with Castille at the time
Anything past Vilar Formoso is essentially the USSR to us
Exactly
You don't act on it, we do
And like you said, it's far healthier
I've once seen a young girl skipping a queue of around 20-30 people to enter a bus
Every
single
person
that entered the bus after her stopped at her seat to berate her for it, before taking a seat of their own
I had never seen someone try harder to be swallowed by a bus seat in shame and humiliation
I'm pretty sure she never did it again
> we are closer in pretty much anything but language to (for instance) Czechs or Slovenians
how so
(genuine question)
Huge PR on our part
It was called the "Hispanic" Peninsula until Spain decided to claim that name for themselves without owning all of it
Heck, 6 or 7 centuries ago we were called "Spaniards" because the "Spaniards" included Portuguese, Castilians and Aragonese, even though we all had different crowns
Same shit with the US claiming the moniker "America" for the whole thing
Still, "Iberia" may come from the same root as "Ebro", which is a river entirely in Spain
We can understand each other mostly kind of
Asymmetrically
A lot of brazillians might not understand spoken Portuguese which is really frustrating
If they are educated then European Portuguese might resemble formal written brazillian ( there is a lot of diglossia there, the way they speak is not how they write “properly”, and obviously this exacerbates class divides)
But we also understand Spanish a bit usually, or Galician even better, or some African Portuguese derived creoles só understanding each other more or less does not usually make people feel it is the same language particularly when comprehension is not perfect and not symmetrical
I dunno, it might be like somebody speaking Ebonics and somebody from Glasgow
But the written languages are just as different, politeness modes, even grammar ( they write stuff like “you is” or “ I saw he” to give an example of how grammar is diverging)
The official policy is it is all the same language and so on, and there are individual testing and language teaching
I think official treaties, being laws are written in very formal language which will be basically PT_PT
African and Timorese Portuguese is very close to PT_PT anyway
But the way people actually speak day to day is not standardized and you can tell instantly
Apps and sites and so on are localized
> "Yeah,the oldest country on the continent
Oh Boy
This is something that really ticks you guys off, isn't it
Namely what is the oldest continuosly existing as a separate and independent country and with the same borders in Europe (Assuming you from Bulgaria, which is the only country in Europe from which that sentence could make sense)
We kind of don't care, except to tick you off, TBH
Welll, The OP (at least from the flair) isn't European either
No, I got what you mean, I really wanted examples in how your culture is closer to those countries since I know very little about the region as a whole
Maps definitions for regions are a bit arbitrary, though
America starts the "Midwest" in Illinois, and the South is really the Southeast
We're only ever Western Europe when preceded by "Worst in" so Spain or Belgium don't get the bad rep
Otherwise we're Southern
> Spain is clearly the dominate one
We're not stuck here with them, they are stuck here with us
I don't know, being an older, stabler and an established nation-state country for longer than they have (not to mention a sizeable overseas empire and influence) does give us a few points that Ireland doesn't have over Britain, hence why we managed to shoo away the "Hispania" name for the whole thing
Not having a good substitute name also hurts your position a bit, but I do get your point about not wanting to be thought of as part of a different country
I like the "St
Agnes isles" moniker, being named after the smallest rather than the largest isle
It is possible to not understand them
Some accents are really weird, some variants seem to go through a different stress phenomena which makes it sound like a whole different language, then there are pronunciations issues which trip us (MEO
No, mel
Ássenau
No, Arsenal
) things like esse means este after all, lack of pluralization ( levanta o braço! Which one
Both
This happened to me honestly in a X-ray) and just things being understandable but meaning way different things ( fecha na segunda-feira, todo ano) stuff like that
Particularly on the phone or with recent arrivals it can be a lot of “desculpe
” from my side as well
So much stuff
Chicken is not carne, for example
Parede mole
Movie and tv language is usually clearer and more dramatic
I do not see a lot of brazillian movies or tv, I think BR tv uses a neutralish kind of accent which is easier, or it tends into formal modes which are not how people on the streets talk but is closer in grammar to how normal modes
I think a portuguese novela shown in Brazil was shown with subtitles
Some "gritty" brazillian movies are shown without subtitles but they can be a bit "what" to listen to
Foreign language movies or tv series are treated differently, in Portugal they are subtitled and ocasionally animated movies and/or children's movies are dubbed locally
In Brazil they dub things very widely anyway, alway locally
Fiction books  or "soft" science stuff written natively in Portuguese usually are not adapted apart maybe from slight spelling things
But everything translated is translated separately (and it is very very difficult to find a portuguese person willing to read to a brazillian translation) and on technical things, the language can be totally wide apart in terms, usages and all
Newspapers and magazines  we do not really read or buy media in brazillian
The very formal  like BBC or Folha de São Paulo can tend to very close to PT_PT though there can be jarring things like bad collocation of pronouns (they tend to overcorrect, LOL, in some cases it has to come BEFORE) or just different vocabulary
Yes
In fact if they want to be public servants they need to do a formal language/grammar test to test their knowledge of formal grammar, even if they got school diplomas or university degrees
The "concursos". (Example, google translate this  Lots of brazillians post in r/portuguese about it, studying grammar and preparing for that
Things like pronominal collocation like "give me" in english
In English it always comes after the verb right
in PT_PT it usually comes after the verb, but there are some words, conditions (particularly negations) which push the pronoun in front, and that is the rule also in formal PT_BR
In everyday brazillian they put the pronoun in front always (me give - me dá) . And it is just school learning the rules to write or speak more "formally". Sometimes they get it wrong, hipercorrect it in that they put the pronoun AFTER the verb even when it should be in front
Things like object pronouns (the equivalent of me/you/him/her/it) in english, also mostly book learning stuff
They are far more likely to always say "Eu vi ele" (I saw he) rather than "Eu vi-o".
They also mix up a lot courtesy modes and their pronouns  and verbal tenses
I'm dumb
It's official ;)
No worries
I just misread, because the all "Bulgaria/Portugal is the oldest nation in Europe" is an old internet peeve (moreso for Bulgarians, AFAIKT), which is silly, because the only right answer is San Marino
> my language calls the Pirenees peninsula
I like that
How do you guys call it
Something like Pyreneean Peninsula
Ah, of course
It slipped my mind that the Austro-Hungarian empire was more than Austria and Hungary, and that Prague/Bratislava/Ljubljana must have been important hubs of the whole thing and not just Vienna and Budapest
It could be African influence as well, because it shows up in African dialects as well, but I think brazillians feel better about Italian influence than Angolan
I am not angry, I was just explaining the differences, why it is difference
And no I do not think it great, or beautiful ( maybe to your ears but to me things sound like “I saw he” or “you is”)
There is a kind of frustration in miscommunication don’t you think
Also maybe Brazilians are more acquainted with Portuguese grammar (though not accent or slang) because it is their formal mode, while Portuguese people can just be frustrated by stuff which just breaks the grammar logic
You might think it great and richer but to others it might look like you are randomly inserting, mixing different text fonts or randomly bolds and italics in something that is meant to convey meaning
And you are going “ so many different things, isn’t it richer
“ well, the point is communication not diversity
Tower of Babel is too much diversity
I would add even something else
Another redditor here, a brazillian is espousing "ah diversity, so cool, so interesting". But in my experience this wild diverging of regional accents and diglossia (differences between official and actual language spoken) can exarcebate social class differences, can be a kind of barrier to social mobility
In Portugal while there are regional dialects (it is getting more blurred with each generation) and class differences in extent of vocabulary or specific vocabulary, usually it is close enough and you can not actually tell much difference between say politicians  who grew tending sheep or child workers in factories or those whose parents were political elite
The language they use is the same
Ditto about dunno football players, there is not much noticeable difference between how the kid son of emigrants who grew in a shelter home and the kid of university professors or doctors speak
I am actually not making up these examples
For brazillians it is different, and it is much harder for the poorer to get a good education in formal language, particularly because the rich have this culture of paying for "extra" classes for their kids prepping them for university (Brazillian kids do not have a LOT of school hours
University is free and merit based mostly, but again the poor start off a lot worst
True
And I just want to add that we are trying all together to standardize the language:
I learned this a few months ago, that a lot of European language and Arab languages, have the word for orange derived from the name Portugal because we introduced sweet orange to a lot of places
That apparent our drug laws are rather unique
I didn't know of thst until I saw some Americans talk about Portugal on the Internet and use it as an example for drug laws
Believe it or not but such subject is not really discussed here in Portugal
In fact, I suspect most Portuguese people aren't even aware of such laws
Which makes sense since the overwhelming majority of us don't do drugs
It actually has bunkers for 110% or 120% of the population, I felt safe in Geneva in case of a nuclear strike, thanks Switzerland
Where'd you think you got pasta from
Limona sounds almost like our word for lemon ("limão")
Cool
> No
Germany's 29
2 isn't "far more" than Luxembourg's 24
8 or Austria's 21
To be fair, Luxembourg is a microstate, and Austria is basically Germany
Correlation does not imply causation
At the beaches I frequent you can find some women sunbathing topless, but I'd say it's probably around 10%. And from what I've gathered they're not necessarily Portuguese women, but foreigners
It isn't abnormal for Portuguese women to do topless whilst lying on their bellies
A few of my friends do that
I'd say like 2-3%
In Portugal some do, but through the years you have less and less people who does this, much more in nudist beaches of course
Agreed
People are overestimating a lot
People didn't carry around instant live broadcasting devices back then I guess
'And gets everywhere'
The millennium falcon costs 1000€ and the average wage is around 930€.
Mate, if you are to receive a foreign stranger in your house, don't you want to know if maybe the guy is some kind of lunatic
I think it is normal behaviour for anyone with a sound mind
About the bringing up of "personal stuff" idk, but if something is on the net for everyone to see, then it's not personal really
Plus, Americans also have a reputation for straighforwardness, so I'd suppose people could think it would be of no matter
TIL it's normal to google someone
What the hell
Do you expect to find something related to that person
Idk about the bringing up of information
I mean it can be creepy regardless, if its out of context and of no useful purpose
Like, "hey Mary, remeber that abortion you were so sad about, like, you made a tweet a couple months ago
Well, there's that
" Or "So, we all know Mark got fired last week
I am going nowhere with this, just thought about it
What do you think about it, Mark
About the American straighforwardness, I'd concede that maybe with the Germans that may not be the case
In Portugal, where I live, and China, where I spoke to people about it coincidently, it is definitevely the case
Early modern and middle English are easy to read and understand for the most part, old English is extremely hard and i couldn't understand it
Scottish is understandable but a bit strange
Friday the 13th in the northern region
It was supossedly promoted by the church for celebrating the death of the pagan gods
The story goes that Freya was defeated and revealed as a witch and joined other witches and the Devil, making it 13 of them (or something like that)
But the rituals and celebrations (ironically) are totally pagan (animal sacrifice, and such)
They burn cats in a bonfire and dress funny
(Although the burning of cats is illegal)
It's funny because the northern region of Portugal is very Catholic, but they're the ones who preserve most of the pagan heritage
But dare you not tell them those things they do aren't Christian
Borat would love to see the figurative jew ( Judas) burnings at Easter too
The Lusitanean gods were not the Nordic gods
But that's just the story the Clergy came up with, I don't know why
I don't think we ever had Freya
The point is we have many pagan rituals and "gods" who were given a Catholic façade
For example, Saint Barbara is the "Saint of thunder"...  What's the real name of "Saint Barbara", I don't know, maybe no-one does
I can't remember any example where a Portuguese official's English was too bad
What I can remember is when our current PM tried to speak Spanish
You may rate [this]
I blame The Beatles' Love Me Do
Yes, when one speaks Portuguese with a Castillian accent you get the feeling they are fluent, until the differences in vocabulary shatter the illusion
Well we started the transatlantic slave trade
Other than that i would say the fucked up things the second Republic (fascist, 1926-1974) did including the ultramar war (1961-1974)
Well ... We literally started slavery
We started the transatlantic slave trade
Oops
Little did they knew 325 years later something whould happen
We only started the Transatlantic slave trade
The African slave trade had already been established and controlled by the Muslim world (it's several kingdoms in the West Coast and North Africa) for several decades or even centuries before we got to Africa even
We were also the first ones to abolish it
Not fully tho because our judicial system through history had problems to ensure that the law was being applicable and unfortunately the colonies continued for sometime (not that much after) even tho it was abolish for the entire kingdom and colonies
Although its a pride and accomplishment being of the first to abolish and something we should be proud we must remember that it wasn't immediate nor the pain caused to the slaves
We first abolish the trafficking of slaves (we pioneer that, 1761) but not slavery has in ownership of human beings, then in 1869 that slavery was truly abolish
Source law student
Edit dates to give context
At least that
Thats interesting
Where to start
Atlantic Slave Trade, raping native women as colonising policy, something, something, a lot, and teaching the Brits about tea (the first and the last were more or less at the same time)
We started the Atlantic slave trade
although we were one of the first European nations to abolished slavery
People seem to almost take offence that I don't like cod fish
So maybe that
A Portuguese that doesn't emigrate
Well
I'm portuguese and I don't like any kind of alcoholic beverage, do I fit in
Also, I don't despise 'AVECs' (Frenchmen or french immigrants), so I'm pretty sure I do fit in
A portuguese that doesn’t like francesinha .. I’m sorry but that’s too weird
someone who doesn't like bacalhau
If you moved to Portugal, you'd be early
Yeah maybe that, you blasphemous weirdo
What's next
you don't like aletria or arroz doce
Portuguese nationality should be taken away from psychos like you
Same i get dizzy just from the smell and just taking a bite and eating it makes my stomach feel like weird and almost like it's about to vomit, be it made by skill family members or restaurants
Same here
Only like one kind of cod fish dish (à Brás), and people get mad with it
Plus, I'm from Lisbon (alfacinha de gema) and don't like sardines
That gets me dirty looks as well
I dislike both those desserts
Spaghetti covered in cinnamon scares me
I like arroz doce fine
Aren't aletria and arroz doce essentially the same thing
I certainly don't. Bleh
I only eat rabanadas and cake at Christmas
I'm not a girl so no
that's why you don't like it
you are supposed to cook the specific noodles, use a rasp of lemon, use milk if you want
if you were served spaghetti with cinnamon then you got a whole different problem to solve
cada vez te enterras mais
Oh, Jeeez
Who the fuck likes rabanadas but doesn't like arroz doce
You are my opposite and I hate you
Rabanadas with vinho do Porto sauce is where it’s at
Shoutout to sopas de vinho too
bem me pareceu
o que tu gostas é do vinho do porto
mas isso quem não?
o Sol (male)
a Lua (female)
so it's the opposite of German
Interesting, are we the only romance languages to drop the "n" in "Luna" ? We say "Lua" here
Moon female, sun male
It’s fascinating that I always think of the moon as female and I can’t imagine it being male - funny how our language shapes the way we think
Same in Portuguese:
Male for sun: O Sol
Female for moon: A Lua
Also, for the Earth:
a Terra (female)
Interestingly, all other planets have a neutral gender, omitting its article
A couple of examples
> A Terra não é plana
> Plutão está longe
It's also worthy to note that in Brasil, omitting the article, even on gendered nouns is common
Same for the Lusos
Oh we use Terra too, written exactly like that
Piggybacking to add the Portuguese words: o sol and a lua :)
Most historians definite Portugal's golden age as the period of Discoveries comprised, *grosso modo*, from  1415 to 1543
Oh yeah, Portugal, "Os Conquistadores" (The Conquerors) Well, we discovered the sea routes to India, had a lot of colonies, trading power house
Basically the whole 700 years
Until fascism kicked in
Then it became kind of awkward
Our golden age started in 1143
And it ended with the Iberian Union
You're kidding, right
This is the real answer
Nope
It was awesome the all way through
Well
There was a generation where the country was under Spanish rule, but we don't really talk about it
As far as we're concerned, it never happened
It's Portuguese as well
Never really thought it was from Latin because it works perfectly in Portuguese as well
So I'm guessing we also don't talk about the people starving while the king built churches with Brazil's gold
Or the Inquisition's existance
Or the earthquake that shattered Lisbon
Or the Civil War
Or the multiple economic crises during the liberal monarchy and the First Republic
Awesome all the way through indeed
A taxi driver charged us 30€ for a 3km in Switzerland (but the taxi was caught in France)
Yeah we only didn't because it was raining :( the day before we did walk, and the thing is, we couldn't get an uber because we were actually in France, and in that zone there were no ubers, only in Switzerland, bad choice choosing a cheap hotel in the other side of the border
Yeah to move in the city I used the bus and mostly the tram, it was really a really beautiful city
Historical villages
[Here are some examples]
I like Viana do Castelo or Tomar but there are a lot of smaller places which are even more beautiful
Any city that is not in the Algarve or a day trip from Lisbon or Porto
I would say that right now the most popular with tourists are Evora, Obidos, Sintra, Aveiro and Braga
So all the others
Tomar, Guimarães and the Costa Vicentina are particularly pretty
As is the Azores
Visited Olomouc and had a great time
The town was a bit empty which is understandable since it was summer and I had heard it was mostly a student town
I enjoyed the calmness and the historic centre was very pretty
Our trip made me want to explore more of Moravia
I planned to visit Hungary this year before Covid 19 happened
I enjoy relatively long stays in places that aren't overcrowded and have more of a everyday life feel
For instance last year I visited the Czech Republic stayed a week in Olomouc and had a great time
Any place like that in Hungary you recommend
Probably French and Spanish, becuse, if you speak english and these two, you can speak to almost all africa, all america, all the caribbean and all of oceania
Probably French
Germany has a bigger economy and moves more people, so I'd say German, but each and every German person I met up until this point has been AT LEAST decent at English
French people on the other hand can really struggle with it
I've seen French people at restaurants in Portugal telling the waiters ". We don't speak English or Portuguese, only French" using some very broken clearly-sentence-memorized English
Also, like someone else pointed out, try to learn the language of the country you end up living in
Knowing English will get pretty much anywhere in Europe, but to feel at home, you need the native language there
Also, most people will appreciate your effort to learn their mother thounge and like you more
Good luck
How to reply to my Portuguese compatriots
Portugal  Caralho
Ps: of course I already knew the holy word "caralho", I just didn't know that I should use it on Reddit
There are more than 7 human bone chapels in Portugal
Best countries to drink a good coffee espresso shot are:
Portugal
Italy
Finland
I believe portuguese population in Luxembourg surpasses 20%! Yeah, emigration
In Portugal we usually fry eggs with vegetable oil
Feels like you guys use olive oil for nearly everything
Me too, actually
Every portuguese I know use olive oil for eggs
> Why of all places Luxembourg
B€caus€.
I see it as a snowball effect
Many portuguese people know someone in Luxembourg, so they take advantage of that support system and move there to have a better life
Knowing that there is already an established community that can help you is comforting and plays a role in it too
Luxembourg is a popular country for emigration in Portugal, as well as France, Germany and the UK, but you don't hear about large percentages because these countries' populations are massive, but there is a significant number of portuguese people in those places as well
Olive oil never sucks
You could put it on top of an ice cream, or eat cereals with it instead of milk and it'd still be delicious
I would say José Sócrates most likely, he is a former prime minister who stole A LOT of money and still hasn't gone to prison
Personally, I would also say António Salazar, our former dictator but there are still a lot of people who support him and I feel like 99
9% of Portuguese people hate José Sócrates
Joe Berardo 100%
José Sócrates former prime minister
André Ventura be like
Get a grip, 99
9% of the people in the chans, most likely
I think I can safely assert 100%. I'd say all 10
280
000 Portuguese citizens hate him
It depends
But just don't speak it like Spanish
I have seen a lot of people impressed by the level of Danish of my father but the face you guys make just seems like he is butchering the whole language
Not Portuguese
Since I dont speak it and spent New Years in Copenhagen
Same
People would then work 10h/day and that's not something everyone can do because it's exhausting and it might be incompatible with other responsibilities (like kids)
Never going to happen as long as we feel the need to keep growing/expanding
If companies get to decide between using technological advancements and better efficiency to increase profits and production, or to reduce working hours, they'll choose the first option every time
The need for GDP and population to keep growing into eternity is ingrained into everyone's minds at this point
I don't see that as clearly
It is great to be able to work a couple of days a week from home
But if companies are set up to work online, it would be much easier to outsource everything to cheaper places
United Kingdom for helping us against the French and Spanish since 1386 :D
Big ups to Italy for Pizza, the Ferrero Rocher (could stand to cut back on the palm oil, eh=), gelato, and San Pelegrino
Thanks to our Spanish cousins for being basically alright for the last 50 years or so
Mad respect to the UK for all of their sitcoms and panel shows, especially QI
Other things, not so much
Germany for sauerkraut and for some efficient and reliable cars
The French, thanks for taking in a large part of our population in the 60s, 70s, and 80s. Oh, and for the Taxi movies, I love those
I'm sure there's a bunch more things I'm forgetting, but these are some of the highlights
Thanks China
We all know where the noodle  truly started
Oh also big up to the arab and hindu world, imagine doing math with the roman system
I'd say Italy for simply making the best food in the world
I'd also say UK but they did send ultimatums to their oldest allies :I
Thank you Spain for not trying to invade us in the 20th century, cheap oil prices, and being a beautiful nearby country with a similar enough language that I can visit any time
we are no longer the best friends, but definitely England for helping us maintain independence against spain
Well, about the Dutch
And then threatening us for our african colonies >:(
Thank you for your music, half of my playlists are just English rock/metal
Dont forget about the tea
I don't know how
The British don't care much about their friends
We used to rule the world
And pillaging the country after the defeat of the Napoleonic armies
( but we love you still, as our favorite abusive partner lol)
A small price to pay being a small nation trying to play big in the "New 19/20 century Europe"
Pink Floyd
You're right
How inconsiderate of me
Thanks also for making sure Ronaldo is the kickass player he is
Sorry, mon frére, all is fair in love and football
Just really love Sauerkraut, personally
Even had it for lunch today-
No probs, I'd just advise you not to let your teen-agers come to Southern countries without supervision
Much like the British, they tend to be some huge jerks
Oh, I see
Could have given us moonehs for it instead :(
Not too late to give us some cash
/u/Peppl, I'll DM you my IBAN
Yup, i only said my favorite band :D
Legendary players are not made without great opposing sides
Without the high competitive level of the whole League, he probably would never have reached his current form: undisputed best player in the world
Iberia is already great
We're great when it comes to food, hospitality, good vibes, sunshine, and IT developers (bit of an outlier there, but it's true
We do need better politicians across the board though
Don't worry about Oliven~~z~~**ç**a.
Still ours though, eheh
People from Portugal understand the Spanish without much effort
I have no problema understanding Spanish
I can understand almost everything and I have never learned Spanish at school
Spanish is a lot closer to portuguese than to italian but I have heard that italian is easier for Spanish people idk if its true
For me Italian is a lot harder I only understand some words but its enough to understand what they are talking about but not the whole sentence
You didn't ask but I understand Spanish almost perfectly written and good enough when spoken, and can speak reasonably Spanish and poorly write Spanish
For some reason the Portuguese understand well Spanish, but the Spanish dont understand well Portuguese
I guess its due to the fonetic
Not if its catalonian
Not so much
It depends
People from Galicia understand portuguese without much effort but that does not apply to people from all Over Spain
But portuguese people in general are very familiar with spoken Spanish
For instance, when I was a child I used to watch cartoon dubbed in Spanish without subtitles
I lived in Italy (Verona) for 4 months and it was enough to reach B2 level
Yeah we eat vowels sounds wich makes it a lot harder but we also have a lot of different vowels sounds when Spanish only have 5 if i'm not mistaken
I never had a Spanish lesson in my life and I can communicate pretty well
Been in Spain several times and never had to repeat myself
Well
Whenever I try to speak Portuguese with a Spanish person - this happens when I'm in Portugal - they just wrinkle their faces
It's like they don't even try
And, of course, they don't addapt the way of speaking either
They just speak their regular Spanish
The portuguese have been so exposed to this behavior that we tend to be more "bilingual".
Besides that, portuguese is a more complex language - phonetically speaking - and we always use subtitles in movies/TV/series, etc
I've never seen having dubbed to Portuguese, with the exception of products that have children as their main target audience
Way to goddamm often
Trump, protests, california being on fire, and god forbid if it's election year
At one point some of the TV channels have very few news about Portugal, but those juicy american drama
You can bet their there
I refuse to believe that there is nothing important happening in the nation to that point
We get just a bit
And by just a bit, I mean maybe 2 minutes, 2 times per day, talking about the election
If there is a special event, like when the George Floyd protests started, we got like 10 minutes of coverage 2 times a day
The biggest news station (or at least the one with better coverage imo), has only one journalist to cover the entire USA
And still, the coverage about the elections is only "trump said something controversial  at an indoor campaign rally with most people not wearing masks, biden responded by saying that trump isnt the man for the job, and is leading by 10 points nationwide in the polls".
This is it
This is the coverage of the most influential country on earth
All time time
But I can't blame them
It's just like Idiocracy was made into a show and each episode is juicier than the previous one
Fortunately it's always reported as if it was just another episode of the sadest comedy show in history
Every fucking minute about whatever subject, usually denigrating Trump and trying to promote Biden
It's annoying af for the reason that I don't give a f about the USA and their internal problems
>I refuse to believe that there is nothing important happening in the nation to that point
Football is always happening
It is crazy that some news broadcasts dedicate as much time to football as everything else combined
I find that RTP1/2/3 usually is more reasonable, TVI and SIC loves to spread that juicy drama
For someone that doesn't even like football, this is just ridiculous
True, but that much is to be expected of the national channel
Yeah Op was talking about our country and how football is always on the news regardless, even during the pre-season and transfer market
This is r/askeurope, when we say Football, we mean the one actually played with feet
It is a year around topic over here
National competitions run for about 10 months
When local teams are not playing, the national team probably is
They only really stop for a few weeks in july/august where the transfers dominate the news and everyone is on holidays either way
In my point of view as long as we stay "separated" by  historical and political borders, have different hymns,  different languages and different cultures to fight for we will always consider that the europeans have a somehow identical cultural, "the european culture" because finally we kinda tolerate and accept other cultures and countries as well
On the contrary, on the moment that we create a "super nation" under only one umbrella things will fall apart
We will see our differences as something disruptive
The history of every nation is scarred with battles and wars for years and years
I believe that an "European Federation" is just impossible to achieve, we are not like the americans or the chinese to just unify under a single banner because we're just too different
And even if that happened, I believe such federation would be incredibly unequeal, even more when the divide between North and South already exists, just go back to the rather unpleaseant statments by Dutch ministers
Can we really expect Lisbon and Athens to have remotely equal power at the table in this federation as Berlin and Paris
Of course not
Do I feel European
Yeah, sure a bit, but I'm Portuguese first and foremost, and I sure as hell don't want to say "I'm European, from the state of Portugal".
I 100% agree with everything you said
As much as I would like to live in the United States of Europe, I know it can't possibly happen even in the next 100 years
*Hops into the conversation*
I think the reason we don't see/experience  the effecta of polarization as much as the US is :
1 Our political systems support , more or less, having multitude of parties, and in many cases coalition government are a thing, from local, regional and nation wide levels
2 The fact that we do not have Europe Wide parties, sure we have groups in the European Parlament but those have lil to no impact on local elections that are the real centers of power
Algarve
I get that it has the hot weather and beaches but what about castles and canons
Bitches love canons
I think a lot of places tourists frequent could do with a whole lot less tourists, including Lisbon
the Lello bookshop in Oporto
it's not worth waiting hours in line and paying a fee just for some stairs
I actually visited bratislava when I did a road trip across Austria
It is so close to the Austrian border that I could actually put it in my Austrian trip
I liked the city but, compared to some other cities I visited, it wasn't the best
But the roads were terrible, specially after coming from Austria
Nahhh they just need to find the cooking rat
the Algarve also has castles
Silves' is pretty impressive
As an Italian, would you recomend going to Urbino
I've heard it's quite unknow for most turists and that it's really underrated
However I don't know if that is really the case
I've heard about the Montefeltro Palace, but not much else
Sounds lovely
If I ever go to Italy, I'll make sure to make a stop in Urbino
It is both a blessing and a shame that Urbino is not that well known by tourists
What is the "rival" country of your country ?
Non europeans are welcome to answer too
We have no rivals
Spain
I'm from Portugal
I always thougth spain and portugal were rivals
Its because of transylvania isn't it
Pffff look at you thinking youre so special, we don't care about you
You ignore Portugal
i always thougth that there was some rivality because of the old times
That's why you empty your sewers in the river at the border
Same here between portugal and spain
Everyone on your border (except maybe Montenegro or north macedonia) hates you guys
Honestly for russia i thougth of ukraine or georgia
I always thougth spain and portugal were rivals
A brazilian appears from nowhere saying "they've stolen our gold
Provavelmente temos nem que seja noutro continente
To be fair the names of the capitals are similar
I think you forgot about norway
You are talking about north cyprius
Im asking you
Totaly not romania not because they have transylvania
Greenland or the rest of the nordics
Grece is about changing name to north macedonia
Why
Sort of
We are hatred rivals but we are also brothers of arms
Pick a decade, and then we decide if we are best friends or enemies
Not really, we don't really care about the Spanish, they only get annoying when they start talking about Iberian Union, as if we don't have History books over here
Never falling for that one again
Sim
agora pelos vistos temos a Venezuela
Got dammit that makes me mad
Remember Aljubarrota se eles tentarem isso outra vez chamamos a padeira
Tell me please
Same here some of us in Portugal consider you rivals but for most spain is one of our brothers
Ahh your flair says china
Yeah, in general we have a prety healthy relation
But when we were weak you guys just used us :(
But still we have a dictate saying "De Espanha nem bons ventos nem bons casamentos" meaning "From Spain neither good winds neither good marriages". There might be still a small rivalry but it's kind of a pacific one
Nah, it is fantastic
Portugal is, at heart an island nation
Plus it has been particularly useful this past month
Isnt transnistria the remenant of the soviet union
Yeah but that's due to ancient Times, just like the brazilians with us
Hope that this situation improves over there
Stay strong
Neither I thought we would deal with this so well
Even the leader of the opposition party is supporting the government, which I have never seen in my entire life
I'm actually proud of our politicians
>due to people passing out drunk in the shower
I can not imagine that being frequent
So no, it is not at all usual
well, even without temperature differences, people can have illnesses which causes them to pass out
Blood sugar, blood pressure things, allergies
yikes, no, not a good idea
Apparently some smart watches can sound a customized alarm/message system which seems like  a very good thing
That looks so
uncivilized
Commet sighted = -1 stability
What are some popular tourist destinations you don't see the appeal of
Doesn't have to be Europe only
For me it's all of those party + beach destinations like Ibiza, Mallorca, Lloret do Mar, Bali, Thailand, etc
I'm not a partying type of person so those destinations don't appeal to me at all
I guess Las Vegas counts as one as well, except for the beach part that is, with gambling added to the mix
I'm sure the neons on that street look nice at night but I'm not travelling to another continent to spend time in a giant casino theme park
I've been to Monaco/Montecarlo already, so I don't see the need to go to Las Vegas
Disneyworld in Florida doesn't interest me at all either
I've already been to Disneyland Paris as a kid
Sure, Disneyland is smaller but I'm not interested in visiting other Disney theme parks as an adult
What about you
I feel the same way about beach and party destinations, they don't interest me at all
A big part of this is due to me being from the Algarve so I already have access to that kind of stuff at home
I never understood why for the final year of high school trip a number of my classmates chose to go to Ibiza rather than Andorra
At least with the latter they could experience something different
The only beach-related holidays I'm interested in are to places with a much different geography, like the Caribbean, South East Asia and islands in the Pacific
Also Greece
Generally I also like to avoid travelling to places steeped in British holiday culture
By this I mean the type of place that aims to create a "home away from home" for Brits
I remember last year some English pals of mine went on a trip to Ibiza and the photos and videos they shared were of them in places surrounded by other Brits where everything was in English
What's the point of going to another country if you're so attached to that which is familiar to you
I mean I get that what some people want from a holiday is simply a chance to relax and that they're not bothered about learning or experiencing other cultures, but it baffles me nonetheless
Agree with your opinion on Las Vegas as well
I've no interest at all in going there
Every so often my friends talk about us having a bachelor party there, but I'd rather not
I've never understood the appeal of casinos or gambling, and the whole place just screams fake
As for your comment on Florida, I'd say that Orlando is a great place to visit if you're into theme parks
I've been to both Disneyland Paris and Disney World, and the latter's so much better because you have four theme parks as well as three water parks
And besides Disney World you also have Universal Studios, Islands of Adventure and more
>Bali, Thailand, etc
Hey, that is really unfair
I would travel to Thailand just for the food, or cooking workshops and so on
Admittedly, my teenage self liked seeing all of those coffee shops, porn supermarkets and such in the city center
I didn't enter any, but just the mere sight of them sure was a new experience
In Portugal you don't just find a sex shop like that in the open, you know
But yes, those young people who travel to Amsterdam for the sole purpose of smoking weed at a coffee shop
what's the point
Yeah, agreed
Dubai looks like a spoiled brat who likes to show off how rich his family is
Also, imagine just how brutal the heat must be
Most beaches look the same to me
As long as they're clean and safe who cares really
I'm not a beach person, anyway
And if I was I'd just visit the ones in my country
I'm not going to spend hundreds on a flight and a hotel in a faraway country to go to the beach
A lot of portuguese people se me to travel to places like Punta Cana and stay at resorts and go to the beach there
WHY
Eh I didn't mean to put down an entire country and should have explained myself better
The main reasons people seem to visit Thailand are also the beaches and partying
Maybe a lot of people visit monuments there too, I don't know
But regardless there's other countries in Asia that interest me a lot more
Japan, South Korea, China, Israel, to name a few
I don't see the appeal of Los Angeles at all
Is it even that popular of a place for tourists
When I was a kid I used to read a lot of tourist guide books and brochures
The Las Vegas hotels always left me a great impression, especially the famous MGM one
But the gambling aspect of the city didn't interest me one bit
So what would be the point of a kid staying at a Las Vegas resort
Doesn't seem like a very family friendly place
I've been twice to Paris and enjoyed it
Of course not all of it is great but it's definitely worth a visit
Unless it has changed a lot in the past decade or something
Well, yeah, a lot of the more modern architecture is pretty generic and soulless
And skyscrapers always look so out of place in European cities
Some cities and countries suffered a lot of destruction in WW2, though, which sadly means they lost a lot of their older and more interesting buildings
I know
Hence why I said "except for the beach part that  is"
I don't understand what that means lol
NYC is pretty much the only place in USA I'd visit simply because I could get around the city without needing a fucking car
It's a lot easier to visit capitals and major cities due to them having airports or more flights there
Reaching a smaller city or town can take up more time of your precious vacation time
Plus some of us can't drive, like me for example
I can't just fly to Bucharest, rent a car there and drive for 300kms to a more rural place
Norway's fjords are worth seeing
But yes, that country is crazy expensive
My brother has been to Istanbul
He said he enjoyed the Asian part of the city more
I can't drive though
And even if I could, 5 hours is a long as hell drive
London's Madam Tussauds and Natural History museums were a blast for me when I visited them as a kid
Yeah I've heard that Ibiza is actually quite beautiful
But they mostly stuck to the touristy/party areas
What a waste imo
I'm sure the AC is great in hotels and malls
but you gotta step outside to walk from one place to another
Imagine leaving your 15C hotel reception and suddenly being outside under the 45C sun
Well South East Asian countries and cultures don't interest me as much as Japan, Korea, China or even Mongolia
Going to North Korea would be interesting just to have an interesting story to tell everyone you meet that you've been there
But other than that seems pointless
You're not exactly free to walk around the country
You'll be watched by a hawk by some guide and won't be allowed to take pictures of a lot of places
You'll mostly be seeing propaganda that the country wants outsiders to see
I can't even drive, but even if I could I'd not want to spent my holidays abroad driving
I wouldn't consider a scorching desert sun and +40C temperatures as good weather, either, tbh
One that always gets me is *push* / *puxe*. *Puxe* in Portuguese is pronounced the same as the English *push*, but means "pull". So whenever I see a door has a sign saying *push* or *puxe* it messes with my brain
Pila
Portuguese for dick, Spanish for battery like AA ones, not car ones
Roxo in portuguese means purple
Rojo in spanish means red
They are not pronounced in the same way but I always found them quite similar but with different colors as their meaning
Padre in spanish is Father, and in Portuguese is Priest
In French, neck is cou, which is pronounced the same way as "cu" in Portuguese, which means ass
Why cross languages with similar words when you can just cross countries with the same language and not agree on the same words
I present to you,  the joys of two Portugueses , the Portuguese and the Brazilian ones (no clue about the other ones, sorry :/)

English: lunch
Portuguese: "lanche" (it sounds the same) - means a small meal between lunch and dinner
"Embaraçada" means embarrassed in Portuguese, while "embarazada" means pregnant in Spanish
"Pastel" in Portuguese is a kind of pastry, or something that takes cod, I don't know how to describe it
In Spanish it means cake
Today I, bring you three words that during my teenage years always made me laigh a lot
Even though we write them in different ways, they have same pronunciation
cú- cou- kuh
cu- slang Portuguese word for ass
cou - neck in french
kuh - cow in german
Also recently learn about curva and kurwa:
curva -  means curve in português
kurwa - whore in polish
Oh, that’s why I always get it wrong
In Portuguese, Pular means To Jump, so Pula is the imperative form of that verb, in the singular second person
It happens all the time
It happened in another comment in this post:
In portuguese we also say curva
If I'm right i think birra is also used by angolan portuguese to say beer
In Brazilian Portuguese it's similar, pasta means paste, and macarrão means pasta
In Portuguese Portuguese, pasta means paste, macarrão means macaroni, and pasta is massa
I love it here
Not the best country in the world, low wages, but it's very peacefull, we are about the friendliest bunch to be around, fairly cheap great food and we get to have better weather than about 90% of Europe
Would I change something
Yes
But overall, it's a great place to live
I haven't lived here for an extended period of time since high school so no, I don't like living here
There aren't as many opportunities, almost everyone is paid miserably
However, I want to buy a house here eventually in the future so I can visit frequently and I would like my children to be raised here because schools in the area I grew up in are fantastic
Nope, Portugal is an amazing place to live, we have great beaches, it's safe, people are nice (genuinely nice) food is the best, great wildlife
We also have small minded politicians
Yes I'm glad living in Portugal specially living in Porto that is the most beautiful place to be
The media isnt that corrupt, but of course you cant watch CMTV that is a basic portuguese rule
Man I love how a portuguese would be the only to complain in all this thread
We are really pessimistic
Thats really our nature
Keep strong brother
I really love Hong Kong and I hope you are aware Europe stands with you
You are more than welcome here
If you have more than 500k € to spend in real estate
You can come to Portugal and we'll give you full EU citizenship
Check Golden Visa
I can sort you out
Safest in the EU and 3rd safest worldwide
As I said before, we have our problems but we're a real mild mannered people
How do you feel about your country's location
Self-explanatory title
Portugal's location is a mixed bag
On one hand it's a good location to avoid wars that involve multiple countries
Portugal owes its stable borders to its location
But on the other hand you feel a bit isolated from a lot of interesting stuff happening in the rest of the continent, which has made travelling harder in the past and made cultural l ideas and exchange harder as well
We like to say things tend to get here later than usual
As for more technical stuff, I guess being by the ocean is alright, but I've never been on a boat in the Atlantic nor do I go to the beach so whatever
As for the weather, it's also a mixed bag
Lots of sun but also lots of wind and rain throughout the year
It should've been 10 meters further Southwest-bound
That way we would have had a moat
I think Portugal has a good geography, access to sea, while kinda protected by the mountainous north and the amount of rivers, but I think France has the better Geography, can be considered South, West, North and even Central Europe, meaning it has good connections to the outside
Border with Spain has the Pyrenees, Switzerland and Germany, they have the Alps at the border (Italy too but not much), it has good connection to sea, pathway to Britain, etc
I am not an expert but this is my opinion
I think if we were more on the interior of Europe, a Era dos Descobrimentos wouldn't have happened and a lot of things would be different tho
Even democracy arrived later to us
Last time I traveled I went to Vienna and something that surprised me were the  boards on the roads saying the distance until Bucharest, Bratislava, Prague, etc
, like if it were cities from the same country, while here in Portugal if you are close to the border you will have a board saying in caps lock "SPAIN 60 km" and that is why we feel somehow isolated
But for me the best thing of living here is the weather and the proximity to the sea
Having the sea just 15 minutes away from my house is the best thing and at least we can enjoy it during 3/4 months in a year (though the water is quite cold here in the North)
>Plus we've got each other
We're brothers
Not really
It feels like the most interesting parts of Europe are too far away from where I live
And your country feels quite distant for a neighbouring country
A huge chunk of your country is closer to France than to Portugal so I doubt it feels like Portugal neighbours you either
That's pretty cool
I've always felt like I was a bit like Switzerland when it came to conflicts among people I know
I just like to sit back and watch the world burn
France actually has a large part by the Mediterranean
Portugal has none
We're exclusively Atlantic
The Mediterranean Sea hasn't played a big role in Portugal's history, unlike the Atlantic Ocean and even the Indic Ocean
>Surely Portugal's the most ideally placed country in Europe for exploration
It has/had straight routes both down to Africa and the Cape of Good Hope and westward to Brazil and the Americas
A coloniser/trading nation couldn't ask for a better location
Yeah 500 years ago
You don't need to go that far
The UK or Ireland could do it as well
Same for France, Switzerland, Belgium or Holland
Or hell, even Iceland
> Portugal isn't enough to pose a serious threat
Only when it employs bakers
Yeah, but we have Mediterranean culture
Of course they do
It's smaller and less of a threat
As a Benfica fan I like Belenenses and Boavista more than Porto or even Sporting
He probably feels that way because he is from Lisbon and Lisbon is a bit isolated from the rest of Spain
I live 50km from the border with Galicia and I agree with you
The cities feel different but the rural areas are very similar
The landscape, the weather, the architecture and even the way the elderly sound, are all very similar
Isn't Andalusia the place of flamenco music and such
Not something I really associate Algarve with
France is "way too cold"? :p
Thst might be the reason sure
The furthest North I've been to in Portugal was to Oporto
I haven't been to Trás-os-Montes or Minho
So Galiza means nothing to me
I've only been to Madrid and the Canary Islands in Spain iirc
None of those places were any similar to Lisbon
I feel this way too
I'm from Algarve and you can definitely tell that both it and Andalusia have a big moorish influence
I used to go to Andalusia a lot during the Summer (because that's when everyone else would come to Algarve lol) and although it definitely felt different, it also felt very familiar as well
Andalusia got most of the cool ruins and architecture though
I studied in Alentejo and went to Extremadura a few times with friends and you could also see a lot of similarities
I was wondering what you meant by that
I had no idea about the similar economic activity or poterry tradition
Algarve is mostly known in Portugal for being a touristic place
A place where a lot of people have a house to go to in the summer
As for Alentejo, well it has a lot of gypsies, so I can see it being similar to andalusia in that regard
It's a quite barren place for such a large region however
It has less than 1M people and it's about the size of Belgium
It's also probably the least religious region in the country and has the highest suicide rates as well
Nah dude, I really like you
People (from European Countries) who have left their homeland and never came back
Why
To be fair, wanting to move away from Portugal (even temporarily) is a very quintessential part of feeling Portuguese
TIL Reddit has profile pics
Sorry, but is not for you to decide other people's lives just because of the political situation of where they live
Is like telling to someone who lives at USA or Brazil that they will never manage to survive because of the political situation on that countries
There are deeper reasons to someone to decide to live in somewhere besides the political issues
He's not deciding anything for anyone
What are you going on about
Yeah ok, that's less wholesome
Good on you guys to come back, I hope it brings you back anything you feel like you guys lost
yeah, I think there's more to it than economy
Spanish economy has also seen some lows historically, and they never much left the place
I haven't yet, but I'd like to try living abroad for a couple of years just for the experience, to be honest
I still use the old one
Obrar (synonym to defecate)
Mandar um fax (send a fax)
Arriar o calhau (don't know a translation to this one, but maybe "to drop a stone") (this one is the best but also kinda indelicate)
We have that as well
Also we have a racist version of it, which is "dropping Obama at the swimming class".
Sorry if it offends someone
You Spanish bros, you're very much like us in these things, but always bit more creative and hilarious
"Mandar uma carta ao salazar" - "I'm going to send a letter to Salazar"
Salazar being the portuguese dictator
&#x200B;
Edit: Added some context and translation
vou ali pintar as paredes da sanita (just going to paint the toilet seat walls)
vou ali fazer uma chamada ao Papa (going to drop a call on the "Pope" -> the Pope dresses white as the toilet seat usually is white) was used a lot in my teens
A bit racist but one I used to hear a lot was "Largar o Eusebio/Mantorras" - drop Eusebio/Mantorras (former black football players from Benfica)
"pintar a sanita à pistola" - roughly translates to "Spray-gun paint the toilet (bowl)", used when you have diarrhea or very liquid poop
Fazer uma chamada no telefone branco
Cortar o charuto (To cut the cigar)
"Fazer um número 2" - to do a number 2, number 1 being peeing
"To send a fax" is also a very popular one in Portugal
I think there was some Ladas here in Portugal back in the day
50 years old
Thought it was older
What was your "that's not how we do things here" story
When I moved to the uk and started meeting people I would always go for two kisses, took me a couple of times to forget that and start giving handshakes
Also when I took some friends to lisbon for a week, they were 3,one British one American and one from Canada, I told them we were going clubbing, they thought we were going home attl 2am, I felt sorry for them when we left at 7
I was once strolling around the city center passing the time until dinner when a group of foreigners approached me and asked where was the party
I replied "what party
" and a guy replied "they told us this is the party area and there should be many parties around".
They didn't believe me when I told them that no reputable bar would be open at 21 and they should go for a coffee and come back in at least two hours
I sometimes wonder what happened to those people
Once I invited one friend from the Netherlands to my house, so we could have dinner with the rest of my portuguese friends and go on a night out
Well, he showed up at my house at 6:30 and I was a bit surprised but ok, no problem, them at around 7:30 he asked me why wasn't nobody at home yet, I said that they we would only eat at around 9:30
Late the night, we were in a bar at around 00:30 am and he asked me if we were not going to the club anymore
I said that we were, but only in 1h or 2h... He was so confused
Same experience in Germany
Germans will often hug as a greeting which makes it extra confusing
Lemme guess
English
Oh I feel for you men, I'd have waited for them to invite me into their house too so I guess I'd have done what you did
10 ssems pretty late
I have dinner between 19h00 and 20h30
I would be in trouble then
I take a lot of medication, so I can't drink alcohol
I'm one of those who always asks for a coke when going out :)
Same here though, even in a restaurant ordering something that's not wine or beer is kinda strange
Truuuuuuust
Very common in the UK
Every time I'm out drinking here they're puking already by 1am
In Portugal n Spain 1am is about the time I get out of the house
Same here, and if you go to a restaurant with friends or something you can even start eating at 22:30--23
Yeah that was another one, once I meat the people they started to hug me, which I find very awkward tbh
Not an UK accent but unfortunately I couldn't identify the origin back then
I assume Nordic by their looks
It's just a culture thing
Most people here go to sleep between 11pm to 1am
Even my grandparents go to sleep at around midnight
I only go to bed at 10pm if I'm feeling super tired or sick
Completely normal here though
Nowadays you tend to see people with all kind of schedules, however there's still a cultural impact that lead most of us to have those eating and sleeping routines
But, for instance, go back some 50 years ago (in villages, maybe 100 in cities) and the people routine would be guided by the sun itself, not clocks
At 10PM in Portugal, at least in the summer, would still be bright, and so, not sleeping hours
Then, people, would go to sleep only at 11PM, or even a bit later
And they would wake around 6AM
7AM
Then you could ask, "wait
but then some people would sleep only 6 hours, isn't that why too little ?", Yes my friend
But then, after a hard working day in the fields and factories, the husband would arrive home and take a little nap of around 30 min
Really
Because I've been to Rome and the traffic is wild
Huh idk much bout Nordic but the British are already drunk by 2200
[This one from Ireland] is even worse
It actually got banned before 9 pm
*Raises glass expectantly*
To your health, my future friend
My 92 year-old grandma goes to bed at 1:30 am
in my experience, Brazilians and Spaniards really crank it up to eleven with the noise
It's okay, I get to drink champagne on New Years though
>Kofola
They don't sell that here
Plus, I always get Cola Zero or Sumol
Never
Well, ours made Trump almost faceplant with a hand-shake, four days after being hospitalised from a heatstroke, so I guess we'd fare pretty well
Edit: Wait, Trump just called him
WTF IS GOING ON, PEOPLE
But she's immortal
No one can defeat the queen
I'm Portuguese
My parents are Brazilian
Growing I never felt like I fit in or felt connected to my roots
I was constantly told I didn't look Portuguese or Brazilian (because I'm super pale - which is silly but still)
I spoke English from a very young age and my dream was to move to the UK as I felt it was a better fit culturally so to speak
I managed to move to the UK 3/4 years ago, and I still think it's a great fit culturally but now I'm constantly reminded that I'm foreign
So, I don't fit in Portugal because I'm too "foreign" but in the UK I'm constantly getting questioned as to where I'm from (literally like once a day as people can't place my accent) and why I'm here and when I'm moving back  to Portugal
Sometimes you just can't win
I'm too "foreign" for both countries
I've resigned myself to live "In-between" cultures
The key to being a true Portuguese is to comment "Portugal caralho
" every time you see Portugal mentioned on the Internet
It depends, really
If you're at a party, no one will really say anything unless it was really dumb to get drunk for some reason
If they're your friends, they'll keep an eye on you
If you're telling random people, they'll most likely politely leave your side
However, if you are NOT at a party, it is not very common and people don't tend to like it
People drink alcohol with their meals (wine and beer), but not much as to not get drunk
If you are randomly walking around in Lisbon while drunk you are sure to get started at
But if you make your way to the party districts at night, people will dance with you
I agree, but among close friends sometimes people say “tonight I really need to get drunk” or something like that, and they really get drunk or totally waisted, and everyone gets the message and understand that
For sure, but I think that was the point of the question
Among friends it's fine and no one will say anything unless it's reckless to get drunk (e.g. if you're pregnant, if you have a job interview the next day something like that)
You can actually get some very passable wines for 3 euro in Portugal
Or you can get bagged wine for 60 cents or lidl vodka for 4 euros a bottle
Love my drinks as anyone else but it's far to cheap to be an alcoholic in this country
People going to the Church
Religious practice appears to be dying off fast in Portugal
Bonus: sleeping the "sesta" in the afternoon
Asking someone for directions, now you only use the GPS
Weekly
Where did you live
Oh, the nostalgia
The hot summer afternoons, no one out on the street, all Nature is silent except the happy sparrows
And then, that whistle
In my street there is a old man that does that, but he is probably one of the few left in the country (and I really like the sound of the whistle)
There is still one around here
There are a few restaurants and that seems to be his main clientele
It is an old man with a tuk-tuk hand decorated with Benfica symbols
This one
And so France decided to join the dirty butt gang because of a chauvinistic joke
They are dying a bit in the younger generations, but compared to the rest of Europe we are still a very Catholic country
I don't mean religious belief in particular, I mean practice
If you were to compare it with a few decades ago, there are way less people marrying, being baptized, doing first communion, attending church on Sundays, etc
Still more than other countries, maybe, but it's drastically descresed in just a few decades or even years, I belive
Yeah, same here
I don't think we do
At least I've never seen anything like that in real life
I've seen Jeovah's witnesses distributing panflets/leaflets either on the street or by knocking on people's doors and that's about it
That's also pretty much the only kind of situations I've ever seen religious people actively proselyting in public
They don´t really exist in Portugal, maybe I have seen one or two, but it's not a widespread thing
I have been to the states and that was one of the weird things, that and American flags EVERYWHERE, which was very strange to me, I mean I like being Portuguese but people around here aren´t so gung-ho about it
Never seen one personally, actually I have seen more billboards that are more "sinner" than "pious"
It is very rare
There are two kinds:
- one vaguely religious but related to the religious festival of the local town which will likely list the schedule for everything, including the religious procession and the music concerts
"Festas em Honra de Saint Whatever
". This past year all have been cancelled and I have ocasionally seen a few simple billboards remind of the festival in general
- evangelical brazillian churches might have really lurid billboards (like "dia de beleza", day of beauty, go to their garage-church and get beauty treatments at a discount) or even roadside billboards
This is really rare, and often it is really creepy because they are kind of promising a solution to family or drug problems or money problems
It is not as creepy as yours though, though our culture is different, they are really alien here, and they are kind of careful to not make political statements or be too splashy, because they are foreign after all
to quote George Carlin:
"He(God) loves you, and He needs money
He always needs money
He's all-powerful, all-perfect, all-knowing, and all-wise, somehow just can't handle money
Yap, and if there were it would be the typical  "Jesus loves you" near a church or something, definitely no "hell is real" shenanigans lol
You have those brazilian churches, there is even one on the A1 S-N just outside Lisbon
And the Mormons that now have a huge temple in Lisbon, courtesy of the Lisbon mayor Me(r)diña.
Yeah, if you see a Portuguese flag outside someone's home it's probably still from the Euro 2004 that people got to lazy to take it off
We had Portuguese flags EVERYWHERE in 2004
I thought everyone had eternal life
I thought the open question is: will it be pleasant
Ugh Brazilian evangelicals are super creepy and annoying
Brazil is the USA of South America, pretty much
Yes, generally on old cinemas
They use the old cinema's bill boards to promote their services
The place where I once saw "The Return of the Jedi", now for only 10% of your income plus other regular donations will help you rid your body of demons
> courtesy of the Lisbon mayor Me(r)diña.
Why wouldn't they
They paid for everything, I think around 20-30 million euros
[The park and public space around are great
I used to see Mormons quite often whenever I travelled by bus to my uni from my home town (and vice-versa)
At least I'm assuming they were Mormons
It was always two guys wearing short sleeved white shirts and ties, and generally they were blonde
Yes, 2004, when we found out that there are a lot of people that all of a sudden loved the flag soo much, but apparently didn´t know not to hang it up upside down
or how it even looks, since they bought a chinese knock off with little pagodas instead of castles on it :D
yes, but that was for the euro 2004, Portuguese people only get gung-ho nationalistic about football
From what I saw in the US that's just everyday life with no apparent reason
That's awesome
I  I would love to have our flag waved on a flagpole in my backyard like the Americans
Italian and Spanish for me
I find Italian easier to read but Spanish easier to understand when spoken
I'm Portuguese, and it's incredibly easy to read Galician (Galician and Portuguese are sister languages), and Spanish
We can also get a general idea about something written in Italian or Catalan, and maybe French, to a lesser extent
I swear sometimes it's easier for me to understand italian than some Spanish speakers but written I would say in order of comprehension: spanish>italian>catalan>french
Spanish is really easy to understand
French and italian we can understand when reading, but some words sometimes i only get when pronounced and others not at all
I'm 100% with you
I find it easy to read Italian since the structure is similiar, once you know the some basic italian verbs it becomes a lot easier
I also think there's a lot of similarites with Spanish
As a portuguese you can easily understand galician and spanish (speaking and reading)
The regular verbs are almost identical and lots of similar vocabulary
You can understand catalan (writen and spoken) and also italian (more writen than spoken)
French you can understand a bit
English if they use formal words (coming from norman)
Romanian you can understand some words (and try to make a guess overall)
Everything else not latin it sounds strange ... or in this case
"extraneus" :)
Yes, Portuguese is quite similar to Italian or Spanish (when it comes to understanding the sentence)
And PLEASE, its portUguese not portOguese
I'd say Spanish and maybe Italian, not so much French
We have some different vocabulary and our accents are completely different (I've heard some foreigners say that Brazilian Portuguese sounds like Spanish, and Portuguese Portuguese sounds like Russian)
And they also completely disregard a ton of grammar rules
We can understand 98% of what they say, they have a bit of a harder time understanding us, but we can talk just fine
And you are making a typo
It's Portuguese, not Portoguese
Same lol the accent from the Azores is impossible to understand
Yeah, we don't really like to open our mouths when talking
My mouth kinda gets tired when speaking English, French, or Spanish lol
It's ok, didn't know that
Coffee
Having a coffee in the morning and after lunch is a ritual so many Portuguese cannot go without (myself included)
Sometimes you'll see some extraordinarily bad parking near a café around lunchtime and you just know that it's because the driver went to have a coffee
The art of "desenrascar", which is more or less improvise, aldo it has a stronger meaning
Portuguese, if you van explaine it better, please do it
Humm probably food habits and dishes (eating a lot of vegetables meat and especially fish, and eating dishes like bacalhau, bifanas etc and bakery goods like pastel de nata)
Also our hate/love rivalry/relationship with the Spain (or the different kingdoms that make Spain with exception being Galiza), if in almost 900 years this hasn't changed probably not gonna change in future
Watching the Portuguese soccer team in a cafe with family and friends everytime it plays against another country will never end in Portugal
Yeah most of my family gatherings (in Portugal) include a moment of one family member sharing their homemade licor/spirit (and in some cases wine)
That and eating tremoços with a cold beer during football match
Yes, there's no way that coffe will go down in popularity around here
It is also so damn good :)
It changed a lot
I remember my grandfather and his generation not liking Spanish people
I do think 2 generations after we see them as brothers, and we like them
Except maybe for the part that they fill every Lisbon sidewalk with their laid-back tourist asses and don't let people that actually work there move faster
It's ingrained even in formal writing
Japanese schools / keigo seminars teach you how to always start a formal email or letter with a small reference to the weather
And then there's nominikation: remember all those formal rules
Forget it
Yes, it's a mandatory company dinner, but everyone is drunk so make all the unprofessional comments you want and pretend it didn't happen once you sober up
Definitely pão com chouriço, bread with a chouriço inside great after a night out that with caldo verde and you are good
Blessed comment
Nah, bifana
E torresmos
Oh yeah bifana too for sure
BIFANA E PÃO COM CHOURIÇO CARALHO
Choripan looks more like a hotdog though
In our pão com chouriço, the chouriço is sliced and added to the bread dough before cooking
There is also a variation where they also use cheese
They might be the same thing
There are some variations, but the one I know is made from the pork belly fat
They cut it into tiny pieces, mix it with salt and other spices and fried on its own lard until it becomes crunchy
What's your province
If it's like [these ones] they look more like the pig cut we use to make entremeada
For reference, they have a similar meal in Denmark
I think [our torresmos] make more use of the pig's fat than the meat
Not really
A lot of people have flags, around euro 2004 there was a really massive movement of people getting a national flag to support our team
I wouldn't think anything of it if someone told me they had one
Usually when people have our flags on display it's either because a) it's either worldcup or eurocup season; b) they're emigrées that have come back to Portugal for vacation or to live out their retirement
It is not that odd normally
Expect it to be seen almost everywhere in National Holidays or Soccer tournaments
If by odd you mean unusual then sure
At most people might buy cheap ones during the Euro/World Cup
You don't normally see people displaying flags on their windows
And why would people own and display national flags all the time
That seems so pointless
>it's the "cool" thing nowadays
That tends to happen when your 3rd biggest political force is a fucking far right party
>Portuguese people have a reputation of being too patriotic,
We do
That probably was on the Parliament or some oficial building, those are normal
But in a normal house, unless there is a football match or something, you don’t see flags
That's just one flag though
You should've killed all of those fascists when the people regained the state
Like us during PREC
They were never gone
They were just hidden
The one from Parque Eduardo VII
That one Sure is big
Also, several years ago it had a big hole on it and took them forever to fix it lol
I don't see the point of that huge flag tbh
It's literally the only massive flag I've seen on real life
Parque Eduardo VII
You have some info about that flag in the Portuguese wiki page
(the park has a name of an English king)
What is your country's most famous photograph
What photo do you think is recognized by everyone in your country as being really important and having a significant historical value
For example, i find that Portugal's is the one of Salgueiro Maia making the peace sign with is hand during the April 25th revolution
Edit: [here's the one is was talking about ]
Also from PT and also from Eduardo Gageiro at the time of the revolution, i think this [one] one is even more powerful
That’s definitely not the most famous one I would say [this] one or [this] one
I just got chills from looking at that photo
Same my dear neighbor
We have the same phrase in Portugal "Rouba, mas faz". Sadly, too many justify corruption this way".
(Not *very* similar but it's as close as it probably gets)
From the night of April 24th 1974 to the Morning of April 25th 1974 The News Broadcast was basically held hostage by the "Armed Forces Movement" (MFA) to announce they had full control of RTP (State owned TV and Radio company)
They then began announcing on RTP1 and on RTP's radio stations that they were gonna make a revolution against the dictatorship of Salazar -- this revolution was later known as the Carnation Revolution
No, it is our history
there are forts, castles everywhere, and you learn about the wars from an early age, because it is still so present
we got lots of war veterans
And if you look at other continents, other civilizations, war is kind of a constant in world history
It is the lond decades of peace and prosperity which are the achievement
In Russia it is said that “there is no family where nobody died in WWII
” so it ends up being quite similar story
Mostly disused but you can still find some of these in agrarian or fishing related issues:
Arroba - 14,688 kg, usually rounded up to 15 kg
Grosa - 144 units or 12 dozens
Still very much in use in winemaking ( and I still recall buying a quartilho of unpasteurised warm milk from the owner of some cows):
Tonel - 2 pipas or 840 litres
Pipa - 25 almudes or 420 litres
Almude - 2 potes or 16,8 litres
Pote- 6 canadas or 8,4 litres
Canada - 4 quartilhos or 1,4 litres
Quartilho  - 0,35 litres
Hurrah for the metric system
It's 15kg in Portugal
Funny enough we used the same alternative measurements, bar the cristianos Ronaldos
Stronger Lusitanian donkeys could carry more
Portuguese food
When I was younger I thought it was boring compared to other cuisines, especially Italian and Japanese, but after having lived in and visiting other parts of the country, as well as having spent a year abroad I realize just how much I love
I still don't think it looks as fancy as certain other cuisines, but it's delicious nonetheless
I can also say the same for architecture
I used to think our old buildings here were dull and that we didn't have proper medieval architecture (in my mind medieval = timber houses back then)
I just thought our buildings were boring and disliked the white wall aesthetic
But as I got older I finally realized that not every country in Europe had old buildings of the same style
I came to love the Southern European style we have, particularly the typical architecture of the Algarve and Alentejo regiona
These days I try and take photos of all the old little houses I find, particularly their front façades
And in uni I came to learn that we have a lot of great modern architects in Portugal, many of whom have designed incredible buildings
I did not like Fado and I did not like soup
I have really learned to appreciate cod
When you're a child, you're all into hamburguers, pizza, spaguetti, sausages and so on but as a proud portuguese I started to enjoy a good dish of cod since I was 14/15 years old, mainly when it's christmas eve
Small talk in bureaucratic offices
Sounds weird, but I used to get so annoyed when people where chit-chatting and consequently holding the line for everyone else
But after living in Germany for a year I had to get a new passport at the Portuguese embassy and the small talk was so refreshing and heart-warming - to be able to connect with the human behind the counter instead of just trying to make it as efficient as possible
Sometimes slowing down is worth it
Same with Fado, now I even learned to sing a bit of it
Thanks
When I was younger I honestly felt like we were small and insignificant, with nothing much to offer
I had a really narrow-minded view of the country and kept thinking everywhere else in Europe was better, but as I got older I came to appreciate a lot of stuff about Portugal
I'm glad it's becoming more popular (though Lisbon and Porto are a bit hectic now) and more people are discovering it
And I'm glad you had a good time visiting Portugal
I really need to visit the Netherlands at some point
I've only ever passed through Maastricht by car but have yet to properly visit the country
A lot of people I know my age went to Amsterdam for the "usual reasons", but I'd love to go to your country primarily because of the art and architecture
You have a lot of great painters and very beautiful buildings
Agree, but I think there has been more like an evolution of Fado rather than only ourselves growing up
Nowadays you have really popular and distinct Fado singers (António Zambujo, Ana Moura, Carminho) and before was just a sad and melancholic song
Just see [this performance] on letterman and tell me something
It just shivers me everytime I listen
I am living outside Portugal and really miss our (fast food like) soup chains
There's nothing like a healthy and filling bowl of soup when you need some comfort food
This is not a european fast food restaurant, but it exist in a lot of European countries, bit not in Portugal
FIVE GUYS
I WANT FIVE GUYS' RESTAURANTS IN LISBON
I've had Nordsee in Berlin and I didn't think it was that good
What did I miss
I only tried it once
It was the saddest tasting fish I've had in my life
But to be honest I wasn't expecting much better in Germany
We say 'email' or just 'mail', afaik
Old people or more formal institutions still use 'correio electrónico', which was meant to be our translation for email, but it barely stuck back then and most people don't use it anyway nowadays
Same
Shame I can't use it professionally
Like other people have said, it's got to do with the English word mail not bring previously used as a loanword
It happens with some other stuff, here in Portugal at least
Plenty of people call Facebook "Face" for instance
Sometimes people also say "cheese" meaning cheeseburger, and since we don't call actual cheese "cheese" in English, it's not confusing at all
I laughed at this
Definitely masculine in Portugal
Spain
England
Brazil
India
Some African country, I can't choose
It could be Angola, Mozambique, Guiné, etc
Also North Africa
EDIT: This is quite hard to choose
Portugal is nearly 1000 years old (first established in 868) and had a global colonial and trade empire that only completely disappeared in the 70s. There are centuries old Portuguese diasporas spread all over
EDIT2: Someone asked me to write the reasons for these choices so that outsiders could understand better
So I will try:
Spain
I think this is obvious
Castile was Portugal's arch nemesis
England
Portugal's oldest ally
We helped each other in numerous wars and most importantly, they helped us maintain our empire and independence
In the end they betrayed us so we murdered their king's cousin (our king) and made Portugal a Republic
Brazil
The jewel of the Empire
Rio de Janeiro was once Portugal's capital
Then our king declared "independence" from Portugal, and abandoned us for Brazil
And then regretted and came back
India
The Portuguese discovered how to sail to India through the Cape of Good Hope (named by the Portuguese, because of this feat
It used to be called Cape of Torments), largely exposing India to the World
Today, some christian Indian communities refer to themselves as "Portuguese", since for them it's synonyms with christian
Territories in Africa were the last to gain independence
By the 20th century they weren't formally colonies, but actual regions
The Constitution stated that "Portugal starts in Minho and ends in Timor". Many Portuguese people lived there
The Portuguese had to fight a decade long war against independentist proxy militias armed by the Soviet Union and the USA, that let to a wave of refugees into Portugal, called the "retornados" (those who return)
The war ended when the military made a coup against the fascist regime
It was about this time we decided to be a European country, more specifically, an Eastern European one
The history of Portugal and it's Empire is veeeeeery long and complicated
Note that this is a country that maybe once had the equivalent (for the time) projection the USA has today, for maybe 2 centuries
But if you are curious and don't want to grind through history books, maybe try reading "Os Lusíadas". It's an epic poem about our history, with a lot of fiction and mythology, but conveys and idea
I believe it would be something like this:
Castile / Spain
Roman Empire
Cordoban Caliphate  / Taifa kingdoms (including here the Almoravid and Almohads)
England
France
If you want it from a currently existing countries point of view, then:
Spain
Italy (not only due to the Roman empire but also due to the Papal State / church politics , and the importance of the Republic of Genoa in the early Portuguese expansion)
England
France
Brazil
I think I would have gone with France for number 4
Napoleonic failed invasions and the liberal movements were some key moments for France
That's it
If we consider European countries only there is one list
If we consider all countries then Cabo Verde, Angola, Mozambique, Guiné, S. Tomé, Brazil, Timor take the top spots
I would include China and India but we learn only about the history of the smaller bits we kept until later
Yes, you're right
All in all, our history is really all over the place
I would even put Brazil below France, actually
Portugal (and most of Europe) have been very influenced by France
Influence on/from Brazil existed, of course, but was in such a simple and straightforward colonial way, you wouldn't need more than a few paragraphs to explain it
Even their independence war didn't take that long, and after that, there was a lot of movement of people, but not that much political influence back and forth, really
I don't know what game you are playing
But if you want to keep Castile at bay you need to use the UK and the Church
If you want to try and conquer it, I would suggest trying to turn the other Iberian nations against it
I edited the original comment :)
Oh definitely
Much like Spain, if we consider relations in the times of the exploration, almost the whole world gets included
On Japan in particular we made quite an impact with guns, religion and food
Other countries in the region like Sri Lanka and Indonesia were at least as much impacted
In 100 years, I would hope the United Nations functions the way the EU does today, and the EU functions the way the US does today (in terms of being a federation, not everything else about it)
How did Germany enslave the rest of the countries
I really hate this victimisation narrative that poor countries like mine tell ourselves
They hit a new record in their exportations since 2018 in the past month of September
During a damn world pandemic
They must be doing something right
They what now
I'm not following
Edit: accidentally hit save
How are they enslaving us
That was my original question
That won't happen
People in charge are not dumb and they know they can't create a federation if they destroy or vanish state's culture, because it would raise nationalist sentiment and soon or later break the federation
National culture and identity is essencial for the European Federation to exist
Also because they are the economical powerhouses of the EU
football coach Jorge Jesus
That man should do humour instead of being a coach
he is a quite good coach - he just won the Brazilian league and the libertadores cup (Latin America champons league)
however he speaks in a weird way and is constantly mispronunciating some words
People pick those mispronunciations and create memes, videos and the rest is history
"Preço Certo". Its a show where basicaly you have to guess the price of things and then win a variety of prizes
However, it has quite a funny/ jokimg around environment and the main host, "Fernando Mendes", makes it much better (along with a few more details)
So its very memed both the show and the host
There was a very funny exchange on TV in a sports commentary program where one guy is demanding the other "diga um" (tell him one [example]), and the other guy responds that there are many but doesn't give an example, so the first guy keeps yelling "DIGA UM" while holding his finger in the air
[This] is the whole thing (the other guys is saying "vários" meaning "there are many")
And [here] is the template (although any picture of him holding up his finger is fine to use)
Very nice, Poland, I'm impressed
But you won't ever beat us, WE SHOT HIM
Portuguese football and their characters  could be a giant meme
Spain
But it's like a brotherly rivalry
Still love Spain though
Spain is the sibling that we're always fighting and will never ever admit we love them
The UK is the best friend we consider a brother from different mothers
France is the girl we used to hate way back, dated for a while but still are good friends after it was over
And our ex-colonies are the sons
I completely disagree
Brasil is the brother country
True
Love Spain and Portugal
They are as different as they are similar ahah
Well to be fair, brother and best friend are very different concepts
Spain is definitely the brotherest country we have
Not after the Pink Map and their Ultimatum
You do know our national anthem was originally an anti-British anthem, right
You're also in one of our places, give Olivença back
It's a bit of both
I hear brazil being called "povo irmão" and spain "nuestros hermanos" all the time
Can't we have two brothers
I would say that the actual contact with Brazilian culture trumps the cliche intros when someone decides to make a video about Spain
I suppose
But then lets also give a call to Italy and France
Everyone in the family loves Italy, too
They are definitely the Fonzie of the group
Change the name, there's only one real Estremadura
we feel the same way about spain too
The joke was that there's also a region in Portugal called Estremadura (central coast area)
Eu entendi perfeitamente o teu comentário, não foi difícil aliás foi bastante fácil sem qualquer tipo de dúvida, não surpreende é bastante normal, tendo em conta a influência histórica, cultural e geográfica
Caso a parte, mas como é que estão as coisas por aí em Espanha
As notícias que recebemos sobre Espanha são chocantes, até faz medo para ser honesto
Um abraço de Portugal para com todos na Europa e no mundo que estão a passar por esta situação difícil
Orgulho da nossa família Latina  :)
No outro dia estava a ver o filme Django, do cineasta italiano Sergio Corbucci, e surpreendeu-me como estava a compreender as falas dos actores
Tanto falada como escrita, a lingua requer alguma concentração para ser compreendida mas a adaptação é rápida
Quanto ao espanhol, compreendo sem o menor esforço, tanto escrito como falado
O Francês é mais difícil de compreender mesmo ao fim de 5 anos de estudo
Ainda assim consigo interpretar o conteúdo duma conversa com base em palavras soltas que se assemelhem às de outras linguas latinas
O Romeno é o mais difícil de todas por ser uma língua com forte influência eslava
Algumas palavras são realmente parecidas com português mas acabo por não conseguir enquadrá-las num contexto
Tirando algumas palavras como "hilo" ou "logrado"  percebi basicamente tudo o que disseste
É muito fácil entender espanhol sem dúvida, até falado dá pra perceber
Quando fui visitar Madrid e Sevilha nunca precisei de usar inglês, um portunhol improvisado chegou para me conseguir orientar
Eu consegui entender tudo o que se encontra escrito nesta publicação e achei esta ideia bastante enriquecedora
É fantástico como apesar de nunca ter aprendido espanhol é possível ler textos nesta língua com facilidade
Vou ler vários comentários de modo a perceber até que ponto consigo compreender outros idiomas também.
Entendi quase todo o comentário, mais ao menos 90%.
Boa quarentena
-De Portugal
Acho que percebi tudo (%100) no entanto espanhol sempre me foi muito mais difícil ouvir do que ler
Francês é o mais fácil de ouvir para mim mas não tenho muito contacto Italiano
A lingua dos Romenos é que me dá mais curiosidade, gostava de saber se algum Romeno conseguiria perceber alguma coisa do que eu escrevi e vice-versa
Sou só eu que estou a ler os restantes comentários e a praticar o meu sotaque nas diferentes línguas
Percebi tudo sem grandes problemas
Estranhamente tentei traduzir à letra e não ficou muito bem
Escrito
Espanhol 85% prai
Italiano uns 50%
Francês uns 30%
Romeno uns 10% no máximo
Falado
Espanhol uns 50%
Italiano uns 30%
Francês uns 20%
Romeno praticamente nada
Percebi tudo, até palavras como vizinhança (vicinanza) são claras
Somos todos irmãos, filhos do latim
Apenas não compreendi "anche" e "spiegare" :)
Comparando o espanhol e o italiano e tendo em conta que o tamanho de ambos os comentários é quase igual, eu diria que percebi 99% do comentário espanhol (só não sabia a palavra "hilo") e 95% do comentário italiano (não percebi o significado de "intellegibili" e "spiegare")
Mas tenho a dizer que já vivi em Itália 4 meses por isso é mais fácil para mim perceber do que um português em condições normais
Quando ouço romeno dá-me a sensação de que estou a perceber as palavras mas depois não sei o que está a ser dito
When I hear romanian it gives me the sensation that I'm understanding the words but then I don't what's being said
Literalmente só percebi 2 palavras do que está aqui escrito
Desde que subscrevi a este subreddit, tenho visto bastantes romenos a dizerem que percebem outras linguas latinas por a própria língua ser uma delas, mas eu fico super confusa porque, a meu ver, não têm nada a ver
Em comparação, falando português, entender espanhol e boa parte de italiano é pêra doce
Romeno
Nada a ver mesmo, desculpem
Percebi o suficiente, cerca de 80%. Deu para captar o sentido
E o mirandês!!!
I understood around 60% maybe more, and got the general idea, it's about the language of Gauls, their culture their institutions, laws and how different they are to Latin language and roman empire (from the implicit context of the way its written)
How the region is divided in 3 parts
How far or close, am I to what's on the text it self ?
More like
Portuguese- -》Galician --》Spanish --》Catalan --》occitan-southern French --》northern French --》wallon
Occitan --》northern italian --》southern Italian -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------》Romanian
Ivan Drago was a great Rocky villain, agreed
Romeno
Italiana
Neo-latim
Apenas percebi estas palavras
Sim é muito fácil entendermo-nos mutuamente basta cada um falar mais lentamente que o normal que a ideia passa
Out of curiosity what does conas mean in that context
Cause here conas literally means cunts
Giro que a palavra vizinhança é mais parecida com a palavra italiana do que com a espanhola
Eu também estudei francês, por isso cheguei lá sem esforço.
Eu pessoalmente acho mais fácil entender o espanhol latino que o espanhol europeu, particularmente como falam no México
Os espanhóis quando falam muito rápido são difíceis de entender, mas devagar percebo
E o espanhol escrito entendo 70%.
Oh :(, espero que isto melhore depressa
i wasn't really sure if i got it right or wrong when i originally read it so i lowball it when I said "60% maybe more" but now that I have the confirmation, i can safely say that it was more around 70/80%. The thing with Latin that makes it a lot easier to understand at least for me is the etymology, there's also an intuition aspect of it idk how to describe it but there's a logic to it
It's beautiful that Latin still lives on, through its "children languages".
Portugal
We do that to wish prosperity
(Finally I read something I can identify with
No kidnapped brides, no broken dishes or glasses, no discussion about who enters first in the church
Just plain rice
Something [like this]
Even though I detest the idea of a monarchy, [I like this flag]
I would go back to the Monarch one cause I like it a lot
Return the beautiful white and blue colour scheme that dates back to the foundations of Portugal in 1139
Red and green in a diagonal
Then I'd put an armilary sphere in one corner and a cross in the other
I have three ideas for the Portuguese flag
Let me know which one you like better
The Portuguese flag looks like it belongs to an African country
Too colorful
Red and green mean nothing and don't go along well
So I would change it back to white and blue
The colors would divide the flag in half, not 2/5
I would remove the yellow sphere
It was only used when Portugal was a Kingdom
And I would increase the size of the shield since the sphere is no longer there
Just the red and green
No need for all of that busy business in the middle
wouldn't mind seeing a dragon behind the union jack though
would look pretty badass
I approve
Yes please
800 years of blue and white shouldn't be erased
And the meaning of a "peaceful nation by the sea" is better imo
Would the Azores flag get green and red instead
Agree, but I'd also make the proportions historical
50% Blue, 50% White
Bro i was going to say the same thing
Meh, i kinda like how it is now, its more original
I think the most overused colours in flags are white red and blue, but the red and green combination is kinda rare, and cool imo
Is nice butt I prefere the white and blue with the cross
I'm not a monarch I just thing is more Beautiful and simple
The flag of king Sancho 1 (1145-1185) is my favourite
ahahahaha have you been drinking
That'd the make the flag meaningless
Some history tour guide:"And here we have the flag of Portugal, as you can see it has too colours,red, which simbolizes the blood spilled in the conflicts fought and green, which simbolizes hope"
Tourist: "Inspiring"
The busy business in the middle gives personality to the flag, each piece has a meaning and history
Yes, people wanted these colors but the Republicans didn't want anything related to the monarchy
I'd also like it better 50/50, just for design purposes
But that would be very similar to the monarchy flag and I don't think it would be very well accepted by everyone
Pautas e vinho verde, caralho
Yeah of course it has
It would be weird not to
It just makes it uglier
Your description sounds fine, actually
Example: Ukraine , blue for the skies, yellow for the wheat and sunflowers
Great, moving on
Plus, it makes it much more recognizable
A flag should have symbolism, but it doesn't have to be a history lesson
As is, if you look at it for 3 seconds and want to draw it it's: red, green, squibly lines in the middle
To the point, see how it looks if it's small: . You don't really see anything but squibles, except for red and green
Flags should be able to be reproduced in a small form, as they are often far away or in the wind
While the portuguese flag is still recognizable because the red green scheme, veritcally separated as such is not so common, the squigly middle doesn't contibute much towards that
But that's just my opinion, I'd expect most people not to agree with that take
868-1139 de date and the Cross is central
When you copy the copy that copied you
Lol your flag is Beautiful
Much love
Brothers
Your flag
You mean that [blatant copyright infringement]
> Honestly I think it's a great idea to have all Slavic people have one similar thing just so we remember that we were once same people
Maybe you Prague Slavic Congress shouldn't have base the colours on the Russian flag and used the 3 combination of colours that are the most used in order to achieve that purpose
Nah, we still hold the license
You can still see it on our current flag
You don't want to go that route, otherwise some other Chad will steal your flag like it happen with Romania
Better just pays us royalties :)
Oh my god no
People do that
Like, non American people
That’s f** up
Nop
But it's expected / common that you give something at least to cover your own expense like food or cellphone bills

The [Portuguese water dog] And we have this symbol: [Galo de Barcelos]

I don't think we have a pet now :(
what came to mind: [Cod]
Yes
But that one is imported from Norway
And we love our pet in more than 1001 different ways
Sometimes I hear people speaking Russian and if I don’t see their faces, I’ll immediately think it’s Portuguese
Then I realize I don’t understand any of it so it must be Russian
Funny how the easternmost and westernmost countries in Europe have such similar sounds in their languages
Portugueses is often described has drunk Spanish or Russian trying to speak Spanish while being drunk
Good question, what do you people think of Portuguese language
I've had friends describe my language, Portuguese, as a Russian man trying his best to speak Spanish but never actually quite getting it (with French elements occasionally sprinkled here and there)
Makes for great Industrial Metal tho
[This always gets linked so here it is]
I also don't think it sounds like Spanish, but Portuguese is similar to Spanish, so my opinion is also not the best
From what I understand the 'th' sound is more pronounced in southern spain making it a regional characteristic of the language in a very popular place in Europe
The English 'th' sound isn't at all regional, and is a very common sound so there really is no contrast against another English speaking place/dialect
I guess that it is why it stands out
I personally feel that the sound adds a lot richness to the language and hope that it stays dominate where it is used
That’s a very interesting video, thank you for sharing
This whole thread is just awesome
Thank you UK, for saving our asses from the French multiple times
Thanks UK for our oldest and greatest Alliance
Thanks Spain for overcoming our differences and end up "nuestros hermanos" again
Thanks Switzerland for the great chocolates and for giving my uncle a chance of having a great salary in the 60's when we earned ours penny by penny
Thanks France for hosting our immigrants
Thanks Greece for understanding us when it comes to being broke (Southern Europe rules
Thanks Angola, Mozambique, Cape Verde, São Tomé and Príncipe, Guinea-Bissau, Brazil, East Timor and Macau for dealing with us for so many years (proud of you guys
Thanks Sweden for the great furnitures
Thanks Germany for being so supportive of us
Thanks everyone else for being such great countries
Love, Portugal
I would say we learned from you, be nice to others and others will be nice to you :)
\-forever allies
Awwwwwww, stop it
We thank YOU for being such (more or less) great allies
Cheers guys
To be fair England saved our collective butts more times than we could ask for
im sorry what
Spain for seafood
I love milka
Does it count

Aww thanks UK
Always in here ️
>Why’d you have to knock us out of the Euros tho
We heard some frenchmen going around saying they were going to win the '16 euro easily, so we had to do it ;) I've visited Wales last year and really enjoyed it, I hope I can go back again sometime
Fresh green wine at lunch is basically heaven on earth especially if you are eating sardines or light meats

Same in Portugal
The outside handle isn't connected to anything
That's just an option when you choose your door
Mine can be open either side as long as is unlocked
I'm talking about what, from my experience, most people in Portugal have
But yes, the other option exists
In Portuguese:
*"Jone maide is uai tu a taverne tru de darque foreste, onli to finde oute dat i forgote de moni
Djóne meide ise uei to a tavêrne tru/fru/dru (th is weird) de darque fôréste, óneli tu fainde aute date e fourgóte de mani
I think it would look something like this, but i'm no linguist
Jone meide iz uei tu a tabern tru de darque forest onli tu fainde aut dat I forgote de manei
John made his way to a tavern through the dark forest, only to find out that he forgot the money
Jónhe maide is uei tu a táverne tru da darque foreste, onli tu fainde aute dáte e foregote de moni
>"John made his way to a tavern through the dark forest, only to find out that he forgot the money".
Jone maide his waei to a tavern frou de dark forest, only to finde oute dat hee forgote de moani
Translation:
O João fez o seu caminho pela escuridão da floresta até a taberna mas quando chegou apercebeu se que tinha esquecido do dinheiro
>John made his way to a tavern through the dark forest, only to find out that he forgot the money
Jón meide iz uei tu a távêrn frú de dárque fórest, ónli tu fáinde áute dat e fórgóte de mâni
"Djon meide is uei tu a tavern fru da darque forest, onli tu fainde aut i forgot de moni"
&#x200B;
And now you just gave me an intense migraine ahah
I would switch de for da and finde to fainde
o "e" no final dessas palavras todas é memá tuga
Its more like :
djone meide is uei tu de darque forester, onli tu faind dat i forgote de monei
e dat por det
Formula 1 GP and the terrible organization with selling tickets and seats due to Covid social distance
TL;DR: [it didn't exist apparently]
Sports
Pretty much as it always has been but fortunately now tv and radio stations are  broadcasting and covering more information about other sports rather than just football which is nice for a change
Other than that it’s just covid, domestic and foreign politics and the economy going to shit
Why is it allowed that a Formula 1 race has 27500 people watching and most of our football stadiums are empty
Coherence isn't the biggest strenght of the portuguese government by now
That is truly interesting
Yesterday on one of our TV news channel they barely scratched the protests in Warsaw, Poland only to mention the cause behind those protests to be an “anti-mask” protest (we had a large gathering of people in Lisbon this last Saturday because of masks being of compulsory use)
I find amusing how generalist news treat their audience
Like I read about Warsaw protests a couple of days ago on reddit and then on some websites and I learned the essential question behind those protests was not about if wearing the masks in public was mandatory or not
I understand that the abortion is still a delicate topic for some people in our country but concealing the truth on current events to appease certain minds is just a shame
Yeah probably a coincidence they did not mention abortion but I also learned otherwise about coincidences, that’s why it seemed that only part of the tale was being told on that tv news piece
Thanks for your input
The coimbra University is normally considered the best in general especially in law, it is actually the oldest university in the Country , and the oldest at teaching law
but the universities classic and new of Lisbon are also highly regarded in law in equal,or almost equal, footing with coimbra
Though the University of Coimbra is generally regarded as the most prestigious university, given it's the oldest one, the new and old Universities of Lisbon and the University of Porto tend to have better scores when it comes to which is "overall better". Of course, at the end of the day, it mostly depends on the field you plan to study
Ainda tens a católica, pelo menos todos os meus colegas que vão para direito querem ir ou para a clássica ou para  a católica
Comment high jack: what do you guys think about CBS
I'm going there on the 2nd semester this year:)
"Ambitious" = too hard  that will shorten my Erasmus trips through Denmark and Northen/central Europe Countries  haha but I knew what I was signing up for
I think I will, Danish people seem really nice and so does  whole country itself :)
I got that impression too, but I didn't want to go any "crappy" university for my erasmus semester, and it was  between CBS and Erasmus School of Rotterdam, but in the end I chose CBS
I think the weather might be a problem in the first few months (I will go on February) is it true
I've already gotten most of my doubts answered though, but thank you
Not even a bit
Yeah, I'm used to cold weather (my city in Portugal has temperatures that vary from ~38°C to ~ -1/-2/-3°C) so I think I will do good there
Plus I really like the rainy days, but we will see if it turns out to be a pain in the ass
Are the infrastructures for sport for example and leisure in general good for when it rains/gets cold
In my opinion every country in Europe has something interesting about it
But I really think countries in American continent are the least interesting, because their culture is mostly adopted from European traditions and they are not that much original
( Not all exemple Mexico and Peru are still fascinating)
Can only talk about those I've been to
Well, Luxembourg didn't have anything going for it, really
Andorra is cool geography-wise, as well as a nice play for snow sports
The capital, at least from what I explored was a bit meh
Didn't really feel much of an identity there
If I ever visit again I'll try and research the cultural landmarks beforehand
Every boring part differs from other boring parts
It's why I'm so interested in seeing what mundane life in other countries is like
Norway has very nice nature
A shame it's filthy expensive
Geography Now sucks
It's a channel citing the Wikipedia page of countries and still find a way of getting things wrong
TravellerTim, Tom Scott or even RealLifeLore are way better to learn about countries
Been in a trip through Belgium and Netherlands
Belgium has more personality
Antwerp and Brussels are just the two the cities I would rather live
Also they have a disproportionate good taste in fashion
The fact that it was around 20% Portuguese in 2017 is quite interesting
The "Brazillian Jesus" was a gift from Brazil to the sanctuary
It's not quite a copy
as per the bridge, it was made by an American company, so maybe there's where the inspiration came from
If you aren't a big fan of Lisbon i'd take a look at the Azores or Madeira Islands, yu can find more nature there and that i tell you for sure cannot be overated
Check the North, is quite different and more original, with more historical places, no skycrapers, green valleys and more happy culture, also azores is much different than any other place in Europe
Went there as part of a Spring Break trip (as do a lot of other Portuguese teenagers)
Liquor and cigarettes are indeed super cheap
I've never been a smoker but I almost felt like I was missing out on some great deals
Dude, if I could afford to go to Slovakia at least once a month to have Halusky, I would
Been there twice, totalling like less than 4 days in the country, but each time I HAD to have Halusky
Nobody mention about being boring, I just said why european countries and there culture are more interesting to me
If I like something more doesn't mean I hate the rest
If I wanted to meet portuguese people I'd just stay home
By that logic, you won't find the palace of the king of Thailand anywhere else in the world, much less in the Vatican
Lmao touché
Nah, the Lake District, Cornwall and Devon are pretty, and cities like London, Manchester and Liverpool are cool
Your welcome, it just sounds so rude and sarcastic, dont know why
A lot, and when I say a lot I mean it
Search for José Sócrates
There ia a scale for that
0-Very corrupt .
100- Not corrupt
Portugal has 62 points
Yeah, a decent amount, but nothing too crazy
The problem is that the justice system is litteral shit
People(including politicians) go to jail for like 3 days and then leave because a) it has a mental problem so he/she shouldnt be punished for what he/she did or b) they just payed to get out and continue the crime life
Otherwise, not so bad
In a scale of 1 to 100, Portugal is rocking a solid 62, according to some recent studies
And then there are the 'megaprocessos' (very big judicial cases involving politicians and bankers) that take more than a decade to get anywhere
Justice delayed is justice denied
Verdes anos by Carlos Paredes
A masterpiece on itself, it's also an example of what a Portuguese guitar is able in the hands of a virtuoso as we never had anymore
[This]
But seriously, maybe some fado song
In my opinion, [Bom Partido] by Linda Martini
Maybe [Canção do Mar] translates to Sea song, is our identify, the sea
Anything by Madredeus, like [O Pastor] or [A Vaca do Fogo] anything they’ve made is a masterpiece
For me, personally, it's [Haja o que houver by Madredeus] Never fails to put me in a good mood
It makes me think of a sunny morning, by the ocean, for some reason
Edit: [O Pastor] by the same group, is also incredible
On a personal note, I don't like it much
But there's no denying the mastery on display here
This is the most beautiful piece of music to ever come out of *anywhere*!
Jóhann Jóhannsson was one of greatest modern composers in the world
Bulgarian folk have the greatest voices in the world
Lisbon native here
Well, its the biggest city in the country
You can find anything you want here
As for life in the city itself
I haven't lived anywhere else to compare it to, and I don't pay attention to other people's lives
I just stay home and play videogames when I have nothing else to do
I live in Lisbon, tourism gave us many things but also destroyed the cities identity
It's not for Portuguese people anymore, we can't afford it and now looks like any other capital city in Europe
I have had the chance to visit Vienna for 2 days last year, and I absolutely loved it
I kept telling myself "I can definitely see myself living here". One thing that I loved were the small SPAR markets lol, so colorful and organized
Do you have any advice or recommendations for someone wanting to work and live in Vienna, whether for just some time or forever
Am currently unsure of my future in Portugal with a Bachelors in Business
Portugal is an island
If I'm not mistaken, a few years ago, even Angela Merkel made that same joke
Imagine this: you can only name children after your monarchs
What names do you have at your disposal
In our case, we would have:
Men: Afonso, Sancho, Manuel, Dinis, Pedro, Miguel, Henrique, Fernando, João, Duarte, Sebastião, Filipe, José, Luís, Carlos
Women: Teresa, Leonor, Maria, Isabel
If it is a boy, Duarte or Filipe
If it is a girl, Leonor
No need to imagine
That's the reason I got the name I have
You go to Santo Amaro da Oeiras and everyone is named like that
Any ruler from your country's area, even it's predecessor
Carol is a men's name
If you count  when the court went to Brazil you would have:
Men: João, Pedro
Women: Maria; Teresa
Same in Portugal, but her cousin(?) Diego speaks and teaches Spanish
from what I recall, that is
That's weird
From what I remember she just speaks portuguese in our version
I might be wrong thou
Omg daredevil with portuguese speakers is a concept i never would think of
In Portugal there's a meme tier discussion regarding two beer brands: Sagres and Super Bock
The discussion is simply about which is the superior one and "supporters" of one usually say the other one is crap
Thing is, both are pretty mediocre
There's a north-south fight where sneakers are either called sapatilhas (in the north) or ténis (in the south)
With onions and a pinch of ground white pepper it's the best way, of course
There is also a North/South divide around that
Superbock sells more in the North (and their factory is near Porto) and Sagres in the South (and their factory is near Lisbon)
And just for extra confusion, Super Bock is NOT a Bock style beer
jokes on you, my friends and I are always fighting between marina and tagus
The one thing we can agree is that Stout is better than Sagres Preta
(disclaimer: I don't drink beer, nor do I care, I just like throwing gasoline on the fire)
How is it divided
Its regional
In Portugal, we call the fruit azeitona but the tree oliveira
I prefer mine with black pepper, but I'm with you on the onions
Seems that way yes but then again, many people in Lisbon claim to prefer SB, at least in my small circle of friends/colleagues
For me both are so meh that for the purposes of a cold one after work, if there's nothing else available
whatever it's on tap right now :)
True
A SB zealot would answer that with something along the lines of "ok, fine, but Sagres is not beer
" :)
Ahaha wow, that's awesome
Nothing of the sort (afaik) but the "divide" goes something like that too
Super Bock also has the advantage of having fantastic marketing campaigns
They're not just effective, they're usually very interesting
For sure, we're not, traditionally, a beer country
This sucks for me (not a wine guy) but then again, nowadays, you can buy anything, anytime
Oof to this day I can’t even smell a marina, worst hangover of my life
Black pepper is good too
One thing I noticed on the internet was, the smaller the country, the more aware they are of other countries
Big countries tend to focus a lot more on themselves, in the news or in history classes while smaller countries don't do that as much
Is Portugal small
What distinguishes us from the rest
Oh, we live permanently shiting about our golden age on other countries
I like how it seems like we all know each other, like no joke you always know someone that knows the friend of your friend
Example: when I lived in the UK I meat a Turkish girl that did Erasmus in Spain and made a Portuguese friend, I said we all know each other, she didn't believe and told me to look the guy up on Facebook only to find out that we had 10 friends in common because we went to the same uni, another, while in the UK meat two Portuguese girls and had friends in common with both of them and they were from small villages and I'm from the city
I think is fun because you always end up meeting a lot of people, but it's also bad because it's a "small" community people talk and Portuguese people are very judgy
Film voiceovers
Smaller countries can't afford to completely voiceover a movie, so we usually just stick with translations of the subtitles
Well , Portugal once ruled the world , and has one of most speaked world languages
And of course it has RONALDO
the UK is a fairly big country though
Zebett
How long
How is your mother and father
I don't hear from them in such a long time
Oh, how you've grown up, we must have coffee some time
When will you be around Coimbra
Lately, I've been passing some time there, but I'm just always jumping to Lisbon and back
Anyways, how is your wife
Any children yet
Oh, how time flies by
Have you seen u/Jz_Ribeiro
He was just above us talking about the glorious, glorious times of this wonderful country
Do you know what he has been up to
I heard good things, good good things
Well, we all know he was never the same after the "incident", you know, the codfish incident, but still, what a wonderful soul full of life
I noticed it while interacting online with Brazilians, most of them really seem to be living in a giant Brazilian exclusive bubble
Still, I perfectly understand why that happens, their country is the size of an entire continent for God's sake
But is Hungary small
Well, I mean, hide the pain Harold is from your country
Destroyer of civilizations
Learn some real trading
Omg martcapt I haven't heard from you in so long, we are all good thanks for asking they are all fine, how's your family
I heard your sister is living in France now, how is she doing
Yeah I haven't seen him in a while actually before we use to go to Alentejo together but not anymore since the incident, poor guy was really traumatized, how is it possible to go to a restaurant and not having codfish
Shocking to say the least I would be traumatized as well
Next time you're in Lisbon just say something and we can go have a beer and tremoços, maybe a chouriço as well
Bom dia
Course he is a big meme
Baduntssssss
No, spice, suger and gold
Cause he BIG MEME
Man, you should have seen us in the 16th century until mid 20th century :)
Let's not talk about it
Shhhhhhh
Ik we started the triangular slave trade, but let's not talk about slaves here
Well, who'll carry the gold, ivory, and sugar
Although we didn't genocide too much, which is kind of nice
The only good of colonial PT considering people merchandise might be that it limited the willingness to genocide its productive "assets"
Portugal from late 16th century until mid 20th century is a rollercoaster of sad emotions that makes a grown man cri
Well your country ruined our spice trade in the east
Shut up spice trade robber
Yeah, I know
I was using the word "lightly", in a certain sense, and wasn't aiming at Spain in particular
Just that, as far as I'm aware PT never tried to exterminate locals (on purpose), probably because they were better utilized as slaves, plus they'd fetch gold in exchange for european garbage
Which is awful, but you get what I'm saying
Idk, the story of the native american "indians" and the cowboy going yeeehaaawww murder murder is my first mental image on what not to do, even in brutal colonial times
Robber of the Maranhão. The Guyanas belong to Portugal
And Japan is our trading buddy until you took it
Yeah, maybe you do have a point there, to some extent
Ahah, I don't think anyone reasonable would call the colonialism period that
You northern bastards really enjoied the Iberian union didn't you
Thanks
That's so weird
I mean, I remember while being taught about it that the teachers didn't focus that much on the brutality, but still
Don't know when Spain gave up its last colonies
Here, maybe because we still had colonies (not slavery, not for a long time) when many politians were alive, many people still have the whole thing present
Like, my grandfather lived 40 years of his life while portugal still controlled Angola and a bunch of other places
In Portugal it is for sure "Não me Toca" from Alsemo Ralph
I guess we have Coração Não Tem Idade, by Toy, but that wasn't international
The lyrics are about a guy who wants to fuck all night, but he doesn't really say it; a few years ago everyone listened to that ironically
We also have Sal Grosso, the lyrics are: "Coarse salt, stuck to the nexk, calm down"; but again that's pretty local
I don't even know what that song is
You were probably not around for Iran Costa's ["O Bicho"] Or ["Milla"] by Netinho
Or if we're being really picky about the artist being Portuguese, ["Estou na Lua"] by Lunáticos
Thanks for reminding me that shit exists :)
That song is awesome
Or "Toda a Noite" by Toy
Hell, they made it into a laxative commercial
You forgot about the real masterpiece
[click at your own risk]
> Michael Teló's Ai Se Eu Te Pego
Damn, this reached Lithuania
Portugal apologizes for Brazil, then
It is an Brazilian song, it was actually pretty popular in Portugal also
I don't know why
I didn't know that version, its awesome tho
We're talking about the same song
NOOOOOOO
That's not even Portuguese, the guy is from Angola
> I don't know why
Mostly middle aged women
That's the name
I always called it "Toda a Noite".
You mean, the PORTUGUESE overseas territory Angola
ANGOLA É NOSSA
( jokes aside, if [O Bicho] is considered Portuguese, than Lord Anselmo is Portuguese too
Yup, it's "Coração Não Tem Idade (Vou Beijar)"
ANGOLA É NOSSA CARALHO
I thought that song was Brazilian
The government is trying to build a second airport near Lisbon to help manage the traffic of the current Lisbon airport (anyone that has travelled by plane to the capital knows how small that airport is)
They started the project a decade ago (maybe even more) and they are still debating the project
Many complications have arisen, mainly due to political reasons (it has been a subject of opportunity for some political parties) and, most recently, due to environmental reasons
The new airport , they haven't decided the place to build it since the 80s
Coimbra metro
Once upon a time there was a functioning train line connecting Coimbra (at the time the 3rd biggest city in Portugal) to smaller towns to east, which was very useful for commuters
However, it was decided it would be better to convert it to a metro system
How to do it
By removing the tracks and leaving no alternatives to users
Meanwhile 2008 crisis comes along, which means no money for infrastructure and for a decade people had to use a car
Recently it was decided to cancel the plans to make it a metro altogether and the path of the train line will become a dedicated bus track
During this time Coimbra has been losing importance as a city and stagnating it growth, becoming the 4th largest city after centuries of being at the same level as Lisbon and Oporto
Well, there are A LOT, but my ~favorite~, that flies completely under the radar, it's a small playground in my city center
The conversation probably went like this:
-We should put a little playground for *little* KIDS in that garden
-Why, yes
But where exactly
-Next to that statue
-Which one
This garden has so many appropriate statues to be next to a playground for little kids
-That 19th century statue of Jupiter kidnapping a very naked Ganymede, that, for some reason, instead of making him into a teenage boy, the artist made him into a toddler
-What a fantastic idea
I am a fan of some of his architecture, can you please explain why is he disliked
Whenever they decide to make a new Lisbon airport In a stupid location there is a major world recession
The universe wants Alcochete or nothing
I mean, yes, def
is a clusterfuck
Although, I'm actually pleasantly surprised
Our energy infrastructure is not a huge disaster
Our stadiums are mostly complete and usable
We got a pretty good ID card and corresponding internet-accessible gov info/tools
But again, like someone from Spain said above:
> We only have beaches and cheap alcohol, it's hard to execute this wrong
We do not appreciate our country enough, going by this thread
It is like projects are cheap compared to everything here
Have you ever used Estação do Oriente in a cold,rainy November day
I honestly think that we underrate our infrastructure
We have one of the best roads systems in the world and expo 98 and consequently, Parque das nações area was a HUGE success, the vast majority of worlds expos become a burden to maintain and rarely see any life after the event
The main problem I have with infrastructure is the railroad system that is horrible or nonexistent across the majority of the country
I have but i pushed through the cold as i dont get to use the station often and just admired its roof that looks like palm trees made of metal
I would probably hate it if i had to use it frequently
The railway system isn't horrible, it certainly does it purpose quite well, but it could be way better
There is toilet roll everywhere, though now I think of it, not a lot of stock
Liquid hand soap for sale literally everywhere, like usual
Rubbing ethilic alcohol, 90% concentration can not be found anywhere, though you can find 96% and 70% (you can dilute the 96% anyway) in some places though not all
Hand sanitizers basically nowhere by now, I saw some mid of last week and somebody was saying they saw some some days ago
But they can not be found on stores right now
Surgical masks, basically not findable
Desinfectant sprays and such still on the shelves, maybe a bit more depleted than usual
Maybe less long shelf milk
Everything else, like normal
Yeah, you can't find anything with 60% or more alcoholic volume, and no masks either
I don't know
I've been to the supermarket the other day and didn't notice anything unusual
But let's see if thst changes in the next few days
It's particularly ridiculous in southern Europe where almost everyone has a bidet (I think)
Ah yes those i crapp CARDBOARD NOT HARD AT all tubes
Wtf do I mean by plastic yeah yeah plastic TP Tubes
Porcodio
It expresses an emotion so strong that it's a crime to say it in Italy
I like "Farfalla". It's Italian from butterfly
No deep reason, it simply sounds very nice and I think it perfectly fits the animal
All the other names are fake
Farfalla is the right one
I was having a conversation with a Russian inter student about this topic awhile ago:
He answered the Portuguese words "fogo" and "chama", which translated mean "fire" and "flame". Then I asked why, to which he responded: The pronunciation is so cool, I love saying this words in my head, they don't even sound that portuguese tho, they could be words used in some exotic place during a ritual or some shit
Possibly "Saudade", a portuguese word, with no equivalent in english, used to describe the feeling of missing someone, or something
It is the primary feeling behind Fado music
There is that Fado classic called "Gente da minha terra" (people from my land) which is about this feeling
The lyrics go like "people from my land, now I understand: this sadness I bear, I've inherited from you".
We use it like that as well
nah, porco dio isn't an expression in Portuguese
if I said the equivalent, (Deus porco), people would just get confused
>Deus porco
AHAHAHA
I imagined a pig god
Like a literal all powerful pig thing
Portuguese parents naming their kids with a female name and a male name following it (and vice versa), for example: "Maria João", "José Maria", "Catarina José", etc
I don't really like it
Thankfully, it seems to be less and less common as time goes by
Sometimes, older names are just ugly: Etelvina, Prazeres, Tibúrcio, Engrácia, Alcindo
Honestly, I'm not a fan of the misspelled English names Brazilians often pick either like Maicon or Estefáni
One of my colleagues was named José Joana
Our teacher wanted to be funny and asked him if he preferred to be called "José" or "Joana", to which he answered with a huge smile on his face: Joana
Eu sendo um José Maria sinto me bastante atacado com isto
Or having Salazar in any part of their name
Maria João is everything but ugly/bad
He would be so mocked in Portugal with that name
I thought that was short for "Charlotte".
Yes, but the list gets expanded each year, and it's not a small list of only "normal-looking" names either, there are names there I've never heard of, even outside Portugal
If you are a foreigner, you can also request a name outside the list, but it will still have to be approved
It honestly sounds more scary than it is, lol
It's not so much that they have to pick from a list, you just can't register the name or the spelling of the name of your kid in some crazy, bizarre way
It's meant to avoid having people calling their kids "Chair" or "One Two Three Four". And in the case you want a regular name, say like "José", it needs to obey Portuguese spelling rules and you need to spell it like that and not like "Jusé" or "Jozé".
However, if one of the parents is not Portuguese, they can apply to register any name they want for their kid
It still needs to be approved, but the Portuguese government is generally pretty lenient in those cases
And I believe once a name is approved, that name becomes available for other foreign parents
To be fair, this is hardly an issue, as most people have common sense and give normal, common names to their kids
I think there is an approved list of names, but then again some celebrities have named their kids weird stuff like Lyonce Viiktórya
That's definitely NOT an approved name, it sounds awful
yes, its true unless at least one of the parents is foreign
and imo that list still allows too much idiot names
Desculpa, José :'(
Conjectura: Todos os nomes masculinos seguidos de "Maria" ficam mais betinhos, com a excepção de "Zé Maria", que fica mais serrano
I mean, it's common, I just don't like it
I know that there are people who like those types of names, it just comes down to personal taste
Hey, agree to disagree
Yup, this
The list does exist, but it only serves to record which names or spellings are already pre-approved or banned, you can still apply to name a kid something that is not already there (and, as you say, there's exceptions for foreign nationals)
Also, the list also restricts some names/name combinations to a specific gender
That one exists because the father (footballer Yannick Djaló, for the ones who don't know) has a Bissau-Guinean passport, so he and Luciana Abreu could opt to name their daughters anything permitted in Guinea-Bissau, which happens to be anything at all
There are some similar to Viiktórya in there (such as: Viktoriya) so it doesn't surprise me much
Honestly, I'm sure that just like anything else, there are ways around it that people will use, too, which is why such names will end up being given anyway
Hey, I love that god
I named my cat after him
To be fair, Thor was the one who dressed up as a bride, Loki just shape-shifted
In modern history I would say the ATM
In the past maybe the passarola (the first prototype of a flying device)
The caravel which made you go *swoosh* in the sea, then the Nau(carrack) which made you go **SWOOSH** in the ocean, some rad maritime instruments which made you not get lost in the ocean and the almost invention of the first airship
the passarola, but the inventor died before making any progress
Plus, tempura
That's about it, I guess
The Portuguese caravel
Although the most used invention right now is probably the microphone windscreen
Probably the Indian Spice Trade route
Or the "Caravela" which was the boat that got to India in the first place
I would say caravels and the nautic instruments were real world changers back in the day
We invented the ATM
feels good to read football and not soccer
Yep, and the SIM card too
Now, I wonder how that would come to be
Knowing Portuguese people like I do, I'm guessing that SIM means something in English lol
Yeah I got it
This
Portugal needs to modernize its rail system, it's falling way behind other European countries
We are in a tough position since we cant really change if Spain doesn't do it at the same time
But yea, Portugal is reallllly far behind regarding the trail system
At least there seems to be a real politically will to change it in recent times
In Germany, they have a machine where you put plastic bottles in and it gives you money (cents) back to use on your next supermarket trip
^((Someone from Germany please verify this)) .
This year, in Portugal, we got about 23 machines as part of a pilot project
I personally never tried it out because the closest one is still very inaccessible
Well, we were neutral in WW2 but since we had a right wing dictatorship from 1929 to 1974, fascist is still a common insult from left wing people to anyone who don't share their views,  because it still seems strange to some that you can really be anti-fascist and anti-communist at the same time
Yeah I think it is still insulting, or at least depreciating
The most popular term here is the word “bufo” but it is an old term from the years of fascism, them “bufos” might have well been your neighbor from couple of houses down the street
Nowadays portuguese natives just use the slang word “chibos” to call out people with that kind of traits
Which is funny because a “chibo” is also a goat in portuguese
Indeed
Another thing people call each other is "Salazarista", since the dictator's name was Salazar
Thats a very disingenuous take
Although some people do use "fascist" or "Salazarista" too liberally there's no false equivalence between being right wing and fascist
It's not common to call supporters of PSD or CDS fascist
Guess that we agree then
It's a privilege
Learned two languages growing up, and it's very useful that one them allows me to communicate with so many people around the world
English goes against it's own rules a lot of the time, but overall I find it an easy language to learn compared to others and a simple one to grasp, which makes it useful as an international language
The downside is that there then becomes an expectation for people from other countries and cultures to know the language, and some native speakers become frustrated when the former don't speak it
Many native speakers also don't feel the need to learn languages other than English, and thus don't put in as much effort in communicating with non-native speakers compared to the other way around
No, but that sounds like an interesting idea
If I was a cook I think I'd play around with fusion cuisine haha
Yeah, tell me about it
In a way the Spanish have it worse
Usually things are labeled with the correct flag for Brazilian/European Portuguese (hence the Brazil flag for Portuguese memes), but it's actually helpful
Most of us would prefer English to Brazilian Portuguese as it's less uncanny valley-ish to us
Spaniards have their flags on "Spanish" because there's 30 million Spanish speaking countries and then it turns out it's Mexican Spanish
I'd rather have Brazilian flags than Portuguese flags marking Brazilian Portuguese content, to be honest
That's the first time I've seen Brazilian Portuguese described as uncanny valley-ish but it's absolutely true
Written Brazilian Portuguese is just like European Portuguese, but there's always something very "off" about it
Even Spanish feels a bit uncanny-valey-ish to me
They are just too close to European Portuguese for the differences not to feel like mistakes, especially because most of the differences feel like simplifications, so they both sort of feel slightly infantile (which is totally unfair to them, but it's hard to shake off)
I literally cannot think of a single videogame with international fame made in Portugal
Really curious to give Control a shot
Love the whole Brutalist thing they have going on in the game
Just a reminder that Crusader Kings III is out people
Also cities skylines, the publisher was Finnish but the developer was Swedish
I used to play the shit out of the Tycoon games, so much fun, as well as Theme Hospital and all the other zoo games
DiRT is more emblematic than Project CARS
There was a post on r/portugal a couple days ago about an award winning game produced by a portuguese team that's coming out in 2021 I think, can't remember the name though
Dakar 18
It was developed by Bigmoon, a studio in Gaia
Same :(
Already out ? See you in 2021 folks
Holy shit, I thought it was going to realese october
What have I done
If I knew this, I wouldn't be having a life like I'm having now
Oh great
I can't wait to go cheat on my sister with her daughter so that i use our marriage to steal their lands back from the muslim pope
It is, I thought it was the opposite for some reason
Well fuck, thanks for getting me addicted in a new game
It's in my top 3 favorite shows
I love from s1 to s3
I love the ending
Honestly the best show I saw in terms of writing
Can't believe this show isn't more known worldwide
Guess because it's not American made
However, from what I heard the experience might not be so good if you are German native speaker
They say they way the actors speak sounds too fake
I love this series, and I believe it will be one of my favourites for many years to come
Thanks Galiza for the influence you had on our language, which I consider that it is also your language
Thanks spain for your really cheap gasoline and diesel
It's worth driving the kilometers
Thank you Spain for
Uhhhhh
Holding it for 500 years without going to war with us
For
Uhhhhh
Cheap Gas
*^Do ^I ^really ^have ^to ^thank ^Spain
*^GODDAMNIT ^it's ^the ^only ^country ^we ^border
*^wait
^by ^land ^anyway
Thanks US for accepting all the illegal Azorians that would get in your boats without you noticing and only revealing themselves when they were in Boston or Jersey
*^No, ^that's ^not ^it
#God, this is hard
Thanks spain for trying to fuck us at every moment you can
Thank you Spain for
the cheap gas
Thank you US for the cool movies we enjoy without dubbing, Spain, because we're able to watch a movie and read at the same time, Spain
Also, I would like to thank Spain for helping out during our summer fires
And cheap gas
Towels
Interestingly, if you draw a straight line from New York across the Atlantic, the first country you find is Portugal
That would make us the closest neighbour across the sea
Weird flex, but ok
Here in Portugal, we have Sumol
It's an orange or pineapple soft drink with a lovely light taste
It doesn't scream "I'm fake orange" at you like fanta does
Food wise, it's one of the things I really miss when I'm abroad
They also have a zero version which is passable, although not nearly as good
And from the Azores, there's Kima, which is a soft drink in the same vein as Sumol
But instead of orange or pineapple, it's this really intense, mouth-puckering passion fruit taste
It's really tart and refreshing
Sumol
its kimda like fanta, but better and the brand is portuguese
>Surge
Wait, you guys have oil reserves and Surge
Man, I'd keep quiet about this
Otherwise, the Americans might get a little invasion-y.
Don't forget [Brisa] from Madeira
I quite like Sumol Zero, better than the original actually
And the Passion Fruit version is awesome
They need to make a Zero version of that
Laranjada (from the same company that makes kima) its the same but its made from oranges
But why does the last sip always taste like metal
Ooooh, I love Lilt
I don't really enjoy alcohol, so none of the usually iconic Irish drinking stuff (beer and whiskey) really stuck with me
But Lilt is a really refreshing flavor, and n my mind, the taste of Ireland
I remember my Danish friends bringing us cans of FK when I was younger
Personally I'm not a fan, but I appreciate the enthusiasm
A few years ago, they collectively lost their shit when FK Booster came out
It was like the second coming of Jesus
Guaraná is delicious
I love a cold can of Guaraná on a hot day
Apparently it has a lot of caffeine though (as does the actual fruit)
We also have Radler here in Portugal
They've actually spun it off into 3 variants: lemon, lime+apple and lime+pear
Oh, and there's a non alcoholic version as well
Não há pessoal a vender aí no Brasil
Olha aí o nicho de mercado
Abc
Never tried it
I'm assuming it's good
So good
Just thinking about it makes me want to go get one
Team Passion Fruit over here
Although I am not a Sumol kind of person (I know, unpopular opinion) and, even worst, I dislike Sumol pineapple (please don't shoot me), I LOVE the passion fruit version
It's the iron price
I'll let you off with a warning this time
But please remember Sumol fondly
To be fair, orange Fanta is about the worst orange soft drink I've personally ever had
See /u/perrrperrr
Now you've done it
Prepare for freedom, I guess
:'(
So long Norway, I loved hearing stories about your high rate of EV adoption
It is but I'm a suspect because I really like the passion fruit flavor
I tried it when they came over that Summer
It's not great, no
Se fores a Varsóvia há Sumol na Smaki Portugalii
Conhecias a Pizzarte
That's our secret though
You have it on the beach, so you associate one thing with another
So, everytime you see a Sumol, you're like "Man, I should go back to Portugal". And everytime you're in Portugal, you're like "Man, this beach trip really needs something refreshing
Oh, they have Sumol, perfect".
Omg a serio que isto existe
Estive 6 meses na Polónia cheia de saudades de tudo o que era português e quando pesquisei lugares portugueses, este nunca apareceu
De nada
Sumol não costuma haver no Biedronka, mas eles fazem a semana portuguesa de vez em quando e encontras produtos portugueses
No Lidl às vezes encontras carnes fumadas portuguesas quando eles fazem a semana espanhola (lógica zero)
A sério
Eu também só descobri porque uma amiga me levou lá! Achei os preços elevados mas dava para matar saudades quando não havia nada no biedronka e as coisas que tinha levado de Portugal tinham acabado
Nice, devias ter ido mais vezes, eles têm um crepe com doce de ovos e fios de ovos que é super bom
Eu estava num grupo de portugueses na Polónia, no Facebook, e eles costumavam alertar quando haviam produtos :) há pessoas em Cracóvia a guardar produtos para gente de outras cidades, por exemplo
Também é bom ;)
Eu tinha a minha própria máfia  levava produtos portugueses para aí e trazia produtos polacos para cá :)
Haaaaaate it
Yes
Even more so because 99% of the time the translation ends up being brasilian portuguese
No taboo at all to talk about António Oliveira de Salazar here
Most people didn't like both him and the life back then
If you ask anyone about it, how was life, what were the differences, even about more sensitive topics, like censorship, government police related tales, etc
, I always found everyone to be pretty open about it
No taboo at all, normally we have two kind of people who fantasize over the regime
The poor nobodies the think that we should burn or cut hands of every criminal in this country, even the guy who steals an apple
Usually the story goes " when we had salazar there was no crime and kids could play in the street" stuff like that
On the other side we have the traditional catholic rich aristochratic families, next to the monarchy salazar was the next big thing since they had money and could keep living the good life and liberals were quiet
From my experience it's not taboo to talk about the Estado Novo (the Portuguese dictatorship til 1974) at all
I mean, when Portugal did their take on "the best Portuguese people ever", well after the revolution, Salazar, the dictator, won first place
It's not taboo
We should talk abt it even more as ppl don't seem to remember famine and all that happen and support the alt right
There are people abroad who very weirdly idolise him and it's just so hard for me to understand, specially when the praise they give him is so different from the praise he sometimes gets from Portuguese people
Like this article from a while back from an American news outlet:
"Portugal's 20th-century philosopher-king may be the ideal model of a leader for our times
Yikes, man
There is one taboo that was left tho
"Right wing" is kind of a dirty word
Not really for me but this is my opinion
English, usually the translations are in Brazilian Portuguese, and I prefer in English because I learn more and get more used to it
I'm so used to playing them in English that it'd be weird to play them in anything else
If the game was undeniably Portuguese then I'd go with that
I like playing in Portuguese when it's possible
English for sure
If there's a Portuguese translation most of the time it's in Portuguese from Brazil and it's weird because they use a different grammar and it's kind of cringy to read like they are making writing mistakes on purpose and use some expressions that doesn't exist in our native language
No offense to any Brazilian but I just can't stand reading it, I would guess it's the same to them for ours written version
I prefer playing them in the original language if it's a language I understand
Sometimes translations are bad and even when they're good some jokes are lost in translation
English, always
Also, I bet that if I changed to Portuguese, it would be in Brazilian Portuguese
That shit hurts
It depends if, when choosing the language, the portuguese language appears with the portuguese or the brazilian flair
Translations are done by brazilians most of the time
Those translations are usually terrible so, when that happens, I prefer English
But if there's a Portuguese translation, then I'll play in portuguese
The original one
If made in Portuguese from Portugal, play in Portuguese
If not, english
Most of times, translations are incorrect/misleading, remove some of the jokes/puns and are often not avaliable in Portuguese Portuguese, but in Brazilian Portuguese
I hate movies with portugese translators due to the voice acting mostly cus their Brazilians who do it and the accent it always the same (IN MY OPINION I JUST DONT LIKE EM)
But I love cartoons and really any kids movies I hate the english version when I hear the portugese version the first time
(Honestly they are just seen as almost non existant)
i think we don't have negative stereotypes towards them
Actually, we have positive ones
Country people are seen as genuine and truthful people
Thats just my opinion tho
Yeah
Im from the countryside and here in Portugal we are seen as dumb, poor, stupid and lazy
I agree
People from rural regions are seen as hardworking and respectful
Even if sometimes they have poor taste in music or clothing
I mean, there are stereotypes for people who live in the north, people who live in the south (alentejo, algarve)
some make fun of the alentejo people for being a bunch of lazy farmers, it usually is just banter tho, i dont think anyone actually hates anyone
I wholeheartedly agree, people from rural areas in Portugal are seen as hardworking, down-to-earth no-nonsense people
They might not have the luxuries of a big city but they have their values right
No, unless you are from Alentejo
Sometimes close minded about some stuff, but is natural and is fascinating hearing their stories and expressions that usually don't hear
I am
Yes
Until I'm able to read all my favorite books in their original form, it will never be enough
I speak English and Portuguese, used to speak decent French too but after years of not whispering a word or hearing it I forgot most of it, always wanted to learn German but never had to chance to go beyond numbers
Bro, do you really live in San Marino
Also yes
Ahahahah
But it might work with sand
I envy those countries with proper snow so much
I've only seen snowing once in my life, and it was very weak, only lasted a short while
Nonetheless, I was euphoric and everyone else in that Viennese street might have though I was a crazy person
Snow here in Portugal only appears in remote places, where nearly no one lives, and comes in dreadful tempests and hard ice, with a touch of blinding fog
None of that soft, fluffy, pure white layers you can play with
The only one I remember was an accident in a pyrotechnics factory in Minho region in 2004
I don't know if it's the most notable but I remember standing next to one of the rocks that was thrown in the air and it was about half of my height
Edit: Apparently there was a terrorist attack in 83 with explosives perpetrated by Armenians on the Turkish embassy
Dear Netherlands,
I miss your bikes and wonderful parks
And I miss your train, you’re railway is something wonderful for Portuguese standards
Dear UK,
Can you please behave next drunk vacations
Meanwhile I miss Victoria & Albert museum still my favourite in the whole world
Dear Germany,
Your parks are wonderful and thank you for all the medical help now with COVID
We will not forget ️!
Dear Poland,
I miss soplica !!
Dear nuestros hermanos aka Spain,
I will visit you again and have tapas and sangria as much as you let me
I really like you as a neighbour history aside
Dear Spain,
Sorry for always complaining about how loud and annoying you are
Truth is, we don’t look at each other much - maybe it’s the endless centuries of rivalry and wars between us
But all that is behind us now
You guys are cool and we have so much in common
Let’s be friends
Or hermanos even
Sincerely,
Portugal
Thank you France, Switzerland and Luxembourg for receiving so many Portuguese people with open arms, and giving them a better life
Although we do have very different languages and culture, we do share those similarities you mentioned and I would like to explore them as well, I'm intrigued by your country old mythology and language
Also, your country has the best flag
&#x200B;
(Fyi, you just need to give us some cod and we will be best friends
It's ok my friend but don't let it happen again
You are welcome back my friend
We think you’re really cool too
Let’s be friends ️
My breakfast always consists of a cup of warm milk mixed with a double expresso
I won't wake up until I drink it
I don't remember the last time I've had milk
I've hated milk all my life, I only use it to eat cereal and in the end the remainder gets discarded
Yoghurt and cheese is completely fine tho
There's several: "para lá do sol posto" meaning "beyond the sunset" ;
"onde o Judas perdeu as botas" meaning "where Judas lost his boots" ;
"fim do mundo" meaning "world's end";
"no cu de Judas" meaning "in Judas butt".
I really don't know the origin of this obsession with Judas
No cu de Judas - in Judas ass
Atrás do sol posto - behind the sunset
It's got double suns, and a non-zero number of retired Jedi Masters
Fellow European Healthcare workers, how are you all holding up
I'm a General Practice/Family intern, in my final year of internship
Friday we were told we're going to do extra-shifts, our vacations were canceled
We still trying to reduce unnecessary appointments as much as possible, but we still have a lot of patients who come because they're scared of going to the ER or the hospital
I have an auto-immune disease and I'm on immunosuppressants
I have to do admit that I'm scared
How are you all doing
Edit: Thanks for the silver and all the kind words
Unrelated, but based on what you see and experience, do you think SNS is ready to take on this issue as the number of cases increases with each passing day
I hope everything is ok with you
It's not uncommon here for people to honk and wave at fire trucks when they're returning from a wildfire
Ours wasn't so bad on Friday, but we're afraid of what is going to come
Since I'm taking my Infliximab on my hometown up North, my next appointment was delayed for 3 weeks
Hang in there, Hermano/a! Boa sorte
Unfortunately that is about it
Stay at home, avoid crowds, wash your hands regularly and avoid touching your face when you touch doors, elevator buttons, etc
I was diagnosed when I was in my third year of medical school
My mother wanted me to quit, but I didn't. I worked too hard to get into college, sacrificed too much
I'm not letting a disease control my life, so I made a choice and I went to one of the fields with the lowest risk of infection
I've been on remission for almost 4 years, so I've been as healthy as my colleagues most of the time
Too early to tell, we're doing everything we can and, supposedly, we're doing it earlier than Spain and Italy, but when you still see idiots partying on bars or going to the beach it makes it hard to tell
Gracias :)
Tu também!
It would increase the possibility of a severe pneumonia from what I know
Some people only have flu like symptons, while others evolve to more severe pneumonia, lower immnunity is a risk factor
What's something other countries get credit/flack for that also exists in your country
In Portugal we have bullfighting but Spain gets all the flack instead
We also eat snails, but only the French seem to be known and made fun of for eating them
The Inquisition
We burned a lot of jews too
Nobody expects the Portuguese Inquisition
I'd say we're in the same boat on that one
That I didn't know
Some Portuguese people eat frog legs
I've never tried any, though
Really
I mean, Hitler was born in Austria
I mean our Inquisition isn't exactly unknown, it's very prominently featured in Voltaire's  *Candide*
When it comes to the Inquisition, I think the ones that get forgotten the most are the french
They're the ones that first started it
I've noticed there's a variety of how British, Canadian and Australian people mention their height and weight online
A lot of them just use metric, but justas many, if not more, use imperial
An Australian told me that Australians nowadays only use imperial for height, but I've seen Australians online state their height in metric as well so idk
Also, it seems like British people use Celsius nowadays
Do men kiss each others' cheeks as well
That's something I've always seen as a French thing
I got surprised when I was in Italy and saw guys greeting with kisses on cheeks
I'm Portuguese and I just use to greet girls this way
Dankeschön
Heute habe ich gelernt
A sério
Em Lisboa o que não faltam são restaurantes onde se pode comer caracóis
Mas talvez seja uma coisa mais regional
Se calhar no Norte ou nas Ilhas não seja tão comum
In Civ 5 Denmark gets the Vikings theme with Harold Bluetooth being their leader
I don't think Danish sounds that much like German
Norwegian sounds more like German to me
Danish has a rather distinct sound to it
The few times I've seen Canadians using metric for height and weight they happened to be from Québec
Is that a coincidence or
Well maybe I'm not running into many big history fans or buffs online, but rarely do I see the Portuguese empire and its slave trade being discussed on the English speaking Internet
That being said, it makes sense that North Americans and the English don't talk about that one as much
Well, you're the first ever person from Sri Lanka that I've encountered and spoken to in my life
Most people I run into online are from Europe/USA/Canada/Australia
Alot of Arabs and Latin Americans like anime, so I also run into them online at times as well
Most common East/South East Asians in English seapking communities seem to be Indonesians, Malaysians and Filipinos
Oddly, Japanese, Chinese and Koreans seem quite rare to find in comparison
Do they don't venture outside of their own countries Internet or something
Oh baby, I'll show you my «auto-de-fé» if you show me your «cure par l'eau» ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
It's really odd how USA never switched to metric considering after independence they wanted to be as different from the British as possible
Also od how the country that's supposed to be the representative of the Western world and the most influencial country in the world uses a system that most countries in the world neither use or understand
Gym machines all over the world list the weights in both metric and imperial
Perhaps in order to make it easy to sell them to American gyms
Ah faz sentido
Eu só comi caracóis em Lisboa e no Algarve
Talvez no Alentejo também se comam
Deve ser algo mais típico do Sul do país então.
If properly cooked, chicken is delicious
I prefer chicken to turkey
Online forums with people from all over the world
Rome please come to besiktas
Well, I think both England and Spain get the most attention and the most flack for their colonial empires and slavery
Probably because they had the two largest ones and their languages are spoken by tons of people all over the world
Don't forget there's lots of Spanish speakers in USA and a lot of States were once Spanish colonies and part of Mexico
People are aware of the French colonial empire but usually when people think of France and empires they think of Napoleon and what he did in Europe
Different from what
The American and UK based websites
Well, it's much smaller, for starters
Portugal has its websites and Brazil had theirs
The Brazilian Internet is obviously much larger since there's more Brazilians than Portuguese people in the world
I don't know what their Internet is like since I don't venture there
Interesting
Let's not blame the Straw Hats for this
Frango também se come muito em Lisboa
You overestimate the savouriness of mediocre cooking
I agree with you
And that's not the only thing Americans do that's different from the rest/most of the rest of the world
They also play sports like American football that pretty much no one else does
Japanese and Koreans play baseball but those aren't Western nations
And let's not get into USA's political system and the way they define liberalism
Seriously, for a nation that's supposed to represent the West it sure doesn't seem that representative
It feels incredibly alien and foreign, as do its practices
Even if its small things such as their date format being MM/DD/YYYY
That crap alongside their usage of imperial makes the English speaking Internet a hassle to navigate at times
>Is this only you or do Portugese and Brazilians not intermingle on the internet
I don't know what the average is like tbh
I don't go out of my way to look for Brazilians if that's what you mean
I don't use any Brazilian websites either
Perhaps Portuguese people who can't speak English thst well interact more with Brazilians online and use Brazilian websites more often, idk
Isn't ice hockey Canadian
Ice hockey is only popular in some European countries in Canada afaik
A lot of those counties where it's popular are small and/or have low populations
Basketball yes, it's a sport played all over the world
And if volleyball is American thst one is also global to some degree
I'd say pro wrestling is the most popular American "sport" worldwide after basketball
A lot of males under 40 all over the world know who John Cena, The Undertaker, Hulk Hogan, The Rock, Stone Cold Steve Austin, Rey Mysterio, Triple H, etc
are
Lisbon is probably one of the cities with fewer scyscrapers in Europe, hell i don't know if we have one at all
It may be the reasons everyone said, contrast between old and new but I think it's also because the airport is right in the middle of the city
It is complicated
It is not just about preservation though that can be pretty much a factor (see Sevilla and Dresden, where new skyscrapers off the city centre would ruin skylines and UNESCO and many locals are not pleased)
It is also a matter of urban planning
This is really hard to articulate, but if you look at new world cities which are really quite young, they might have farm land open land in many directions around, you can plan and build roads, and infrastructure in a whole recent neighbourhood without much constraints
European cities, and look at a place like Paris, or Lisbon  which can be really old, are kind of spreading from their historical centers
Even if historical centers are off limits to build skyscrapers, as you move from those centers there are other historical centers, limitations, areas which have been built long before, of villages and towns which got absorbed into the bigger city as it spread
And it has been spreading for centuries and the bits which are not developped often are so for a reason and now might be particularly cherished for environmental reasons
To build skyscarpers on existing plots with surrounding buildings, it can be pretty complex
You need to plan for acess to it - lay down maybe new electrical lines (which might not be possible or easy
It is amazing the limitations which can exist in Lisbon's historical center), water
The skyscrapers can shade nearby buildings
Roads might be too narrow to plan for access for people to actually live, or work in those skyscrapers
Prontos ou não, aqui vou eu
"Um dois tres, aqui vou eu
" (Something like  that, idk about continental Portugal or if it's really like this
(One, two three, here i come
"Caralho, aqui vou eu"
PS:I m portuguese
Preparado ou não, aqui vou eu
He is portuguese for does who didnt know
Not really, if think adapting your vocab should be the norm
Changing your accent however, comes off as very cringy imo
I would prefer if they did
I do not think, or am up to date, on all the brazillian terms
And it can be a total brain freeze if a brazillians asks me for the trem and I can not recall if they mean train or tram and both are nearby (Rossio
Also manners, I get their manners are different, but it would make a better impression if they adapted
Africans it is usually not an issue, they are very corteous mostly, but brazillians got this habit of just approaching people, using a not too polite term of address (você. Ocasionally moço/moça which is kind of like lad/lass) and asking/saying what they want, without good morning/afternoon or hello, or please, or excuse me
It might be perfectly normal in their country, but your instinctive reaction is pretty bad
I'd love so
I have no idea of what some words mean and they might sound unintentionally rude when addressing people (using *você*, for example)
If you're going to live in rome, behave and speak like a roman
If your visiting rome on vacation, no need
"Romans" may have different accents, but they all speak latin
It is as infuriating to see someone who speaks portuguese using terms that don't make sense in Portugal, or having no concept of cultural ajustment in regards to manners, as it is to see the Brits and Americans that have lived here for 10 years and don't know how to say anything more than "Olá, como estás" with a spanish accent
To that point, at least Ukrainians try to learn the language and adjust as much as they can
They could just speak english, which would probably be easier since a lot might know it already, but they don't. Because they're not dicks
I think we appreciate it if they adapt to our language, but I don't expect them to speak perfect continental portuguese either
Exactly the same with BR Portuguese and EU Portuguese
I think the word they use for flight attendant is hilarious: Aeromoça/Aeromoço. It basically translates to "Aerolass"/"Aerolad".
I don't mind brazilians speaking with their own vocabulary
Yes, their way of speaking souds rude to us, but you have to be aware that that's how they speak and that they're not trying to be offensive
It does bother me when they can't understand us tho
It bothers me even more when portuguese people (especially young people, born and/or raised in Portugal), spell words like they do in Brazil (anônimo, sinônimo, freqüente), or even use PT-BR words instead of common PT-PT words ("jeito" instead of "maneira", or  "chance" instead of "oportunidade")
Ok, but did you read the question
Moço/moça is very rural, and in that context, yeah, it is very weird
The spell word thing is probably an automatic complete thing which is loaded from brazillian examples
No portuguese person ever would try to put two dots on the letter u, like ever
I am not even sure where that is on my keyboard
... it's more annoying if they don't, except if they're tourists
I think the reply was obvious, I just went on a little tangent
No, I read your reply
I just don't think you read the question lol
It is very rural and is better avoided
It can be disrespectful particularly if addressing somebody older, and second it can have a connotation of somebody working class working a lowly job  or short for moço de recados)
And portuguese society in general maybe as reflexion of the 1974 revolution (with capitalistas, reacionários, reforma agrária, exploradores, PREC and whatever still on living memory of many many people) is pretty sensitive, reactive still,  about modes of address or other words evoking unequality or condescension from the client (like the client should not use tu form either, and not tu pronouns or imperatives also
Never give  an order on the tu form except to children or of course people you are in a tu-status with)
Use senhor/senhora, case closed, better to be too respectful than not enough
If it sounds cumbersome of person is too young, what we all do, what instutional communication is drop the pronoun
"desculpe, sabe onde fica X?"
What are some things you don't understand about your neighbouring country/countries
Spain's timezone is a strange thing to me
Only the Canary Islands share the same timezone as Portugal(well, except for the Azores)
It just seems strange that the timezone changes when crossing Northern Portugal over to Galicia or vice-versa
Spain should have the same timezone as Portugal, the UK and Ireland, but timezones aren't always 100% logical so
Spaniards, why do you dub EVERYTHING
I can't understand why you would put a dub above the original unless it's a chidren's cartoon
I don't understand Spain's need for a nap after lunch
It doesn't make sense ahahah
If the Spanish timezone confuses you, check out China's timezones
The Azores should be 2 hours difference
It's been a while but last time I saw a map with timezones the Azores were spread pretty thin in the 1 hour distance from mainland
Interesting
Maybe he thought it would make international trade easier or something
Also, apparently Portugal tried adopting the same timezone as Spain, France, Italy, Germany etc
back in 1993-1995 but people didn't like the change because it was still night time in the morning and the sun set at like 22h00
Plus Madeira was now 1 hour behind and the Azores 2 iirc
On average we have lunch and dinner slighy earlier than you guys I'd say
2PM for lunch at earliest isn't a thing here in school or at work
It's usually 12h30-13h30
we eat and do everything at the same time as you guys, but when we're eating lunch the clock says 1pm here and it says 2pm in Spain
To be fair that so applies to France, Germany and Italy
I keep forgetting Russia borders Norway
Geopolitics
Russia, specially the government feels threatened by what they see as expansion towards their borders and to what they consider to be their zone of influence
Russian geography in military terms is compromising because of how flat Eastern Europe is
As for Putin, it mostly comes down to people kinda missing the USSR, specially the older generation
They had a role in world affairs that they can't have anymore
Until not too long ago a lot of places in Portugal didn't accept card payments
Mostly smaller family owned stores and restaurants
You have specific days for Tacos
I've only had tacos once in my life
Why should they be eaten on a specific day of the week
Pizza and pasta at the same time seems odd
Sometimes two good things don't mix together
That's a lot of carbs
I'd feel bloated
What do you mean exactly
If it's our not so great social mobility then I agree
The gap between the rich and the poor here is not so good
There's 7up and Sprite, we don't need Lemon Fanta
Like wise, we find your lack of Sumol disturbing
Fanta
We do not drink Fanta
That is an American thing which tastes of rind of orange, awful
Sumol or compal or, best of all, Kima, ah Kima
Fanta, no
>without the pleasure of cold coffees
Wait
People actually *enjoy* drinking cold coffee
Without being forced
For me this is both a TIL and a TIHI
What next
Cheese with Codfish
...cold coffee
Doesn't thst defeat the purpose of coffee
That's like drinking hot Coca-Cola
>Also my girlfriend works sometimes with Germans and she says that they never want to improve something even if it the current method is highly inefficient
That goes against the efficiency stereotype
Yeah it's weird considering England's NT only won 1 tournament and it was back in 1966 already
And the way they beat Portugal and West Germany was a bit suspicious
? Sesta is a thing in Portugal too
To bring people to the interior and create a capital away from possible attacks from the sea
I was shocked to learn it's illegal to drink alcohol in public in some countries
Is that supposed to fight alcoholism
That's one of the 5 biggest countries in the world
Ofc it has various timezones just like Russia and USA do
Then we'd have to wait yet another hour for their voting places to close during elections
Some Portuguese people eat frog legs
We still have those coins here
They're indeed a pain
You know Pam, in Spain, they often don't even start eating until midnight
I remember that period
It was horrible, stupid
It was light till 23 in summer, starting classes at 8:30 in winter was even drearier
I think I can understand that
Tourism can be a kind of burden in a city or neighborhood, and a lot of tourists feel entitled to just demand help, assistance, recommendations whenever ( I got stories)
Also after a whole, there are places where rent is so expensive, everything is geared for tourists and locals just would not set feet there or know it too well
And then there is that other thing which is when tourists find good small authentic places and those places get ruined, expensive or queues or crap or usually all of it at the same time
Just do not stop people like that to ask for personal restaurant recommendations  it is a big insensitive to whoever actually lives in a place feeling tourism stress  Just do your due diligence beforehand,  and take risks, go with your instinct
Except when it's for kids, yes
Most shows and films are subbed
Most people prefer the original, even with dubs in Brazilian Portuguese
We're probably more exposed to English because of that
Also pointing out it is all those foreign police who are too brutal and do not understand how to make those delicate soulled English fans abroad behave
That's true
Spain might have a point here
I know but in Spain in some cities they close stores and universities don't have classes after lunch because people have to nap
In portugal you don't have that anywhere
Ah well I was born in 1990, so I was way too young to remember that
No wonder it changed back eventually
The sun setting at 23h sounds hilarious though
I stopped drinking soda years ago and I think I've only had Fanta twice in my whole life
I mostly drank Coca-Cola and 7Up
> skordalia
Hmmm
That
actually seems like a good combination
Lots of Garlic , olive oil and some sort of pureed base (prob
potatoes) with fried salty cod fish
I think I've got a new recipe to try on my unsespecting family this wekend (already have the cod fish, obviously)
I guess this does more than make up for the cold coffee
...........NO ONE EXPECTS THE PORTUGUESE INQUIS
Wait, that's made with haddock, not Cod Fish
Carry On, then
/actually, after my initial post I remembered that there is indeed a traditional "Tarte de Bacalhau" (Cod Pie) which *can* include cheese, though it's more usually made with cream rich white sauce
Not my favourite, by far, but with a good strongly flavoured
Açores Cheese grated coating, it's not all that bad
/^now ^I'm ^hungry
Can confirm that cutting up spaghetti is a thing in Portugal
Vespa and Lambrettta for mopeds
Tupperware for the meal plastic boxes
Tulicreme for hazelnut-chocolate spreads
Kispo for lodge jackets
Nutella for any brand that makes a similar products
Kispo - quispo - an impermeable jacket
Jeep - the type of cars that jeep does
Gillette - Gilete - razor blade
Are some examples in portuguese (Portugal)
"Maizena" for "corn flour" is a classic in Portugal
Literally no one knows any other way to call it
post it for sticky notes
bostik - for the reusable plasticine for stick things on the walls
panrico - for sliced bread
coca-cola - for coke
all stars - for the famous model released from converse
bimby - for kitchen robot
jipe - for the 4x4 car model jeep
I heard kispo is also a brand
>"taparués"
I've never heard it like this, just Tupperware with a massive Portuguese accent, especially the w turning into a syllable of its own
There's some variation in the way people actually say it, but I've never heard it without the "-re" bit at the end or ending in an S sound
As far as I'm aware, you just spell it tupperware anyway
Jipe from Jeep
Also, Jeep for that type of vehicles
And dodot for any baby wipes
Yep
Kispo for any padded winter jackets
we should start spelling it tamparuére
Want a ghost chup
Exactly, but the ones like Jeep and Land Rover
I think is written like "Jipe".
Escreve-se "taparuere"
([Fonte]
Maybe, I'm from Porto though, so not that far away
I say it like tâpâruére, with two closed As, but in my experience lots of people say tápâruére and tápáruére
Some people say tamparuére and are often mocked for it
Probably a Mediterranean thing xD
Very interesting
In portuguese we have the word "dragão" which means dragon
A kite would be "papagaio" - a parrot
Pila
Portuguese for Dick
Spanish for battery, the tv remote kind and the likes
Either way, someone's putting it in wrong and getting disappointed
A budgie is a "periquito"
German is one of the languages I'd like to learn someday, so thanks for teaching me a couple words :)
It might be, I've never heard much different
Sometimes I've seen it called "papagaio de papel" (paper parrot) as well, but "pipa" or "arraia" I've never heard before
Is there a non obvious explanation
basically anytime I went to New York and saw someone falling in tourist traps
Once in Budapest while talking to these german guys I was saying things I could say in German, I was obviously drunk and I said "Deutschland uber alles" because I genuinely thought it was part of your anthem, the guy looked at me with this annoyed look and said: "No man, cmon, don't say that" and I was a bit confused until I asked "why not, its part of your anthem" and he explained and I remembered how I had repeated it multiple times in Berlin and felt like a total fucking idiot and spent the rest of my vacation embarassed as fuck, thinking: "oh god i'm one of those tourists"
I still cringe everytime I think about this
God, I thought this was just a myth or a recurring joke we kept making, but I've actually seen this happening in a café.
I don't know where the tourist was from, as she was speaking English with a non-native accent (so she wasn't Spanish either), but she paid and said "Thank you, gracias
" when receiving the exchange, and every Portuguese around her just kind of perked up and subtly twitched
It was beautiful
España es un sifón turístico, sabes
Llama mucha gente de todas las partes
I guess that's a considerable factor too
Yep
Some people from Lisbon call the rest of the country " Província " i.e. " Provinces".
It pisses off everyone, at least in Porto, the second largest city, where I'm from
we use provincianos (from the province) to describre the ones who live out of the city
However Iove the word people from Madeira Island use to describe the ones who live out of Funchal (the main city of the island) :vilhão
Azores here
That is regarded as a PALOP in Lisbon standards
ahaha
As we say, I've been very happy at Peso da Régua !
We call you cubanos
Cheers from Madeira
To be honest, the name doesn't come from Porto either eheh
Portus Cale was the roman name for the harbor at Gaia, a city that lies on the opposite river bank of Porto
As we do, we just started calling the northern bank of the river Porto, which means literally Harbor
If Silesia thinks every idiot comes from Warsaw they should see the type of idiots Warsaw imports from Radom
Why, though
You are the ones stuck in an island, trying to get to the mainland
You're a bit confused
The harbor (both sides of the river) was Portus Cale (Harbor of the Cale people)
Later Vímara founded Porto, naming it so for the harbor and then founded Gaia, naming it New Village of the Cale
The idea that Portus Cale meant "Port of the city of Gaia" is totally unfounded
They were just named after the same Celtic people
Nobody is stuck and nobody wants to go to the mainland honey
you’re the ones that are stuck in a rectangle trying to come to the tropical island with no corona
You think we’re in some kind of sick competition with Azores
They’re beautiful
Please go visit
:) Also, please find something useful to do rather than answering to a 83 day old comment
I never had any embarrassing experience, but it has happened to me A LOT
Specially in Europe, there are portuguese people everywhere
The cities where it happened the most were Paris and Geneve
In Geneve, I literally went A HOLE DAY only speaking portuguese, and I didn't intend to do it
I managed to get a portuguese tour guide in a museum, a portuguese employee in a store, and portuguese Waiter at lunch (Italian restaurant), dinner (fondue restaurant) and at an ice-cream shop
It was a really weird experience
I went to London in a school trip
We were a big group and the only other person in the subway was a guy making his own cigarette
We, as the dumb middle schoolers we were, decided to grab a speaker and started playing a song about losing your weed
We were all laughing, thinking that he didn't understand us
We were about to leave the train when our teacher asked him, in Portuguese, where some place was
He responded but didn't say anything about our song
We all left the train quiet and embarrassed
My family was the one who heard someone else
My family came to visit me in Poland and I took them to Warsaw's old town
My dad is admiring the palace and of a sudden we hear "have you taken the picture yet
" to which someone replied "I would but this fat fucker won't get out of the way
". My dad turns around without missing a beat and says "the fat fucker would have moved out of the way if you had asked
I've never seen someone get so red and speechless so quickly
Not me, but while on the bus in Belgium (flemmish speaking part) there was a young man in the very backseat of the bus explicitly talking about how he had sex with another man the previous night in my mother language (portuguese) and he also had the other person on speakers so I could hear the whole explicit dialogue between them
Pretty awkward ride
Here in Portugal, you can take German in secondary education, so it's not as uncommon as you might think
In addition, Portugal has a [german school] which offers comprehensive education, so there's a lot of upper-middle class people that go there
Edit: Why were you talking shit about Portugal
I mean, there's a whole bunch of possible reasons, but I'm just curious
Naaa if you go to Luxemburg, it's can happen like that very often and I'm not joking
Is that song possibly the "Ganza na areia" meme
Yeah, I believe you
Literally 1/3 of the population of Luxembourg is Portuguese
And this is why I never go anywhere anymore without wet wipes
Well, that and the kids
As someone who talks shit about Portugal a lot, I agree with you
However, it is extremely disheartening for young people to see that if you're working in Portugal, you are often (in European standards) not making a lot of money
And seeing that there's one set of rules for common folk, and another for the rich and politicians also doesn't help
You are Portuguese, you are supposed to talk shit about Portugal
Unless, of course, an outsider talks shit about Portugal
Then, suddenly, we will all defend it till death
(however, stating the obvious, that salaries here are low, doesn't qualify as talking shit
Completely agree with you
Everytime a foreigner starts talking shit about Portugal, I can feel the spirit of PORTUGAL CARALHO rising
We get that a bit
It's mostly people who went away for a year, or a couple of years
When they come back they're all like "Fuck, Portugal's a pigsty, I forgot how behind the times everything is
How do you stand it
". It's really annoying, to be honest
I always find it fascinating because one of the reasons why we don't move forward is because such a large part of the active population moves abroad
Spanish people, specifically Spanish women dress very smartly everywhere they go
The French are smart dressers too but, not as smart as Spanish
Swiss and German are casual dressers like the Portuguese
People from Moscow are so good looking I never noticed how they dress
The only think that I've noticed hasn't much to do with the clothes themselves but the way people treat their bodies
South Europeans tend look more like they workout, pay more attention to make up, hair style etc
Things to do with their body
I think this is because of the weather
Most of the time you're going to be showing a lot of skin, so it makes sense to worry more about this kind of stuff
Edit: for example, here in Portugal there's some social pressure to not look too white
People will comment a lot on your appearance of you have no tan at all
So people put an effort to have at least a little tan
I don't see this being a thing in North and Central Europe
From reading the answers, it seems I might be the odd on out
I dress normally to go out
At home wear pijamas/loungewear all the time unless I'm going out in the next 20 minutes
I like to be comfortable
I have to wear several layers of medical grade compression (legs and arms) and so once I get home I immediately just want to be as comfortable as possible and just change into pjs
Whenever I feel like it, I just drive 80 miles and have lunch in a seafood restaurant in Spain
Then I come back home
Unfortunately,  we can only make this trip to Spain because it's our only land border
No ID shown, no customs, no nothing
We just cross a bridge or get a ferry to the other side of a river
Well, as an example, our gas here in Portugal costs more than if you buy it in Spain
Most people that live close to the border prefer to go fill in the tank in Spain than here
It's really usual for portuguese people living next to the border to go for fuel in spain because it's way cheaper
As a Portuguese person, there is only one terrestrial border so the obvious answer is Spain and before the pandemic you would cross like nothing
Usually I do those trips just to refuel (Spanish fuel is much cheaper then ours) and for visiting Seville or Merida whose cities are close to the border
As I live right in the down corner of Europe the only country that I can go easily by car is Spain (1 hour driving to Galicia)
This year due to the pandemic, borders were closed between March and June, but now there is free traffic again
In average, once in a year I like to visit one country somewhere in Europe, depending on the cheap flights I have available
Luckily, right before the pandemic, I had the opportunity to visit Austria in the beggining of the year
To Spain, normally I go 2 or 3 times a year, most of the times spending one day or two somewhere in Galicia (mainly Vigo), but this year I didn't have a chance to do that unfortunately
But still, this is me who lives in the extreme southwest of Europe
I have family living in Switzerland or Luxembourg and it's completely different, they cross borders almost in a daily basis
I have to say that I am 29yo and I don't own a passport
Never needed it and I live in France, 5km away from Luxembourg and 5 away from Belgium
I enter and leave normally without any restriction (this in normal times, not with corona thing)
And yesterday I went to Germany to do some shopping
Ah and I went to Italy by car last week to visit my bf's family
We crossed Switzerland and nothing was asked either
Edit: oh and I'm portuguese, I emigrated here 3 years ago
Im from Portugal and I could just cross the border to Spain by going through it haha
I live close to the border, and could basically walk into Spain without anyone noticing or even caring
People routinely drive into Spain for fuel or gas (which is cheaper) or for groceries (some are cheaper, some are not)
I've had friends living in Spain, but working in Portugal that would pass the border back and forth everyday
As long as you stay inside the Schengen Area, it's like you were going from state to state there in the USA, only people speak different languages in each one
Before the virus I's say it was pretty common for having traffic between the borders, I'd always see few Spanish license plates and if you were close to the border, crossing it to go to the nearest gas station would save you money since it's cheaper there
I remember being in vacation in Monte Gordo, near the border and crossing it casually to a nearby Spanish town to pass the day or in the North of Portugal, where it was yo Tui, Galicia instead
The schengen area is quite crazy, you can be driving and not even notice you crossed borders and now you're in a completely different world
It isn't uncommon for us to take a day trip to Seville
I'd probably go to Spain if I lived a bit closer to the border, because as it right now it's a bit of a hassle
Every time I go to Algarve, it seems like a different country
I took a flight from Liverpool to Dublin a few years ago and got the "city bus vibe" from most people
The only word that comes to my mind atm of having made me slightly surprised is ***soutien*** that means *bra* in portuguese and *support* in french
Maybe I found it funny imagining the producers wanting to make it sound fancy, but direct to the point
These are only from the North, due to English immigration: soquete-small sock, aloquete-lock, locket, tótil-totally
ooohhh, there goes my imagined brainstorming meeting
Excluding mirandese cause it’s an oficial dialect
Maybe Spanish or French
Se tiveres aprendido uma lingua latina antes, tens uma vantagem para aprender Português.
I agree with a lot of what you said but I would encourage you to go to uni, you will probably find like-minded peers
Uni learning is worlds apart from school learning too
Any lecturer worth their salt will be super happy if you are as clever as you say you are
Plus if you get in with the lecturers they will be a track you can take to do the awesome things you want to do
It's decriminalised, here, which is perfect
The interesting thing is that you don't really see/smell it around
What is sometimes noticeable is the smell of smoke on someone's clothes, but it's quite rare (relative to tobacco)
The thing we've had here is: before decriminalisation drugs were a huge problem, people were taking them for all sorts of reasons
Nowadays, after the law's passing, consumption has decreased immensely
Very common between university students
It's everywhere and almost everyone below 25yo has smoked it at least once
In Portugal it is not legal but it is decriminalized so you won't go to jail if you get caught
Hash is more popular and cheaper here
But last year there was a big drug bust operation and now my friends say it's getting harder and more expensive to buy at least here in the North
Very very popular
Smoked two this morning already, but here we smoke more hash
Everybody smokes
I don't, which is hilarious, because I was actually named after it (I'm 40, and my dad still smokes)
Well Idk about you but I used to smell it around all the time when I was living in Lisbon
I agree with the rest though, and it might just be a Lisbon thing
I don't think that the decriminalization method is perfect, I mean, it was the best solution at the time but right now we are losing a big opportunity
Remember the drug problem that we had here wasn't due to cannabis but heroin and crack/cocain
If we legalize (cannabis) we would give way better support and access to users, by doing that everyone would be more informed, the money made from it could be invested back on education and the healthcare system
Portugal has a good climate to produce cannabis, specially if compared to other european countries, we already produce it but for foreigner companies
Apart from that, this legalisation could attract younger people to farming and smaller areas of the country, repopulating them
Tons of new business could emerge from that, using hemp to produce fiber, materials to build housing and even transform the local gastronomy
Adoro como os comentários aqui são todos de portugueses mas é só grandes testamentos em inglês
I'm from Lisbon, I just don't go near the *Baixa* area that often
Neither that nor like *Cais do Sodré* and so on (places full of people at night, you know
I agree that, there, yes, it does smell a little, but it's not really that spread out, I mean, you don't really smell cannabis in other parts of the city that often, at least I don't, but I do always have a runny nose :)
Yes, of course, I meant "perfect" as in "I don't have a problem with it, I actually do support it" :) .
And yes, legalisation should be something we should strive to, of course, I'm all in with you
No, people do smoke tobacco, here, not as much as I’ve seen in other European countries, like Spain or France, though
It’s just much more common to smoke cigarettes than to smoke cannabis
It’s easier to get (and legal to buy, btw) and much like tobacco, it gives sort of a bad impression
Tobacco is much more well accepted and it’s disregarded as something harmless, which is a shame
It’s much less of a problem in younger people, but still, [studies] found that about 10% of 15 year-olds are “regular tobacco consumers”.
Oh yeah, it’s definitely only in certain areas, especially the ones you’ve mentioned
I used to smell it mostly in some parks (not even secluded ones either, near pretty busy areas) but you’re right, it’s definitely not in every part of the city :)
I feel people are smoking less tobacco in Portugal
At least my group of friends and acquaintances that were heavy smokers no longer are
I used to smoke too and I quit :)
Congratulations
Well what I’ve seen is a transition from cigarettes to Iqos, those heated tobacco devices
Yes
Even though we have a list of official names, it is very extensive and accepts multiple spelling variations for the same names
This is due to official spelling changes through time, as well as immigration
Sometimes the change is as simple as a diactric change (a/á/à/â/ã) and sometimes letters are changed
Tiago/Thiago, Filipe/Felipe, Adriano/Adrián, etc
there's also Dupond & Dupont
This is mostly due to official spelling changes through time
We do get a lot of weirdly written names from Portuguese speaking immigrants thought
We also have "Davide" and "David"
That's not completely true
The names you mention (all the second examples) are not possible to give to a child of two Portuguese parents, and can only be chosen if one of the parents is foreign and they provide examples that the name exists in their original countries
All other cases must pick from a list of names where spelling is consistent
Spelling standards evolve with the time, and famous dead people have their spellings change: "Luís de Camões" was originally spelt like "Luiz de Camoens".
how would you pronounce Arletta and Arleta differently
do you mean people tend to write down her name as Arleta instead of Arletta
Regardless of how, the reality is that those names exist in the country, and that is what the question is about
Yeah, that's true, but it's honestly a rare-ish occurrence
That is not my experience
When I was in school, I always had someone with a non standard spelling in my class
And I have several colleagues at work with alternative name spellings as well
And most of them were born in Portugal, but don't ask me how that happened
I literally never had it happen until I started working
Maybe there's less immigration to my area, that would make sense
Not native but the classics that I usually spot are:
"Did you saw that"
"Me and my friends"
"A lot of persons"
"To who
"To *whom*."
"Oh, I'm so sorry, my English is terrible
Caminho de ferro or ferrovia in Portuguese (ferro means iron in Portuguese)
So, iron path pretty much
*Caminho de ferro* and *Ferrovia* both mean Iron road
*Linha de comboio* can also be used and it translates to Train line
"Linha férrea" in Portugal with the 1st meaning is "Caminhos de ferro"
Steel is Aço not Ferro
but yeah sounds cooler
Not really
Most of the country is rural but still you can find a house almost everywhere
Alentejo is our region that is less populated but still almost every mile you cross at least you see a house
Yes, but that is because people avoid building houses close to railroads whenever possible
And there are trees and walls protecting houses when not possible
At no point you were ever more than a couple km away from the nearest home
A Finnish forest is like space
No one can hear you scream
as long as it is someone who follows Portuguese culture I think it would be just a little trivia fact about the president
if it were basically a foreigner holding Portuguese nationality it would be seriously controversial
We might have had it
I can think of at least one sovereign queen born in Rio de Janeiro
And there might have been others during the republic, I have no idea
It would not a big deal, as you can see from me having no idea about others
edit  - this made me go look, and found another one born in Rio de Janeiro
and the first two presidents of Portugal were azoreans, I did not know that
Portugal already had 60 years of Spanish Kings and it didn't turn out so peaceful after all
> if it were basically a foreigner holding Portuguese nationality it would be seriously controversial
It would also be inconstitucional
As our constitution does not allow for foreigners that hold portuguese nationality to be candidates to the presidency
- vide art
122
º of the constitution - it expressily states "portugueses de origem", excluding all portuguese that have acquired their nationality later in life
There are a number of high political offices that have the same such requirements, actually
most of your country is Germanic though
Visão Júnior
Slowly creating sleeper agents for the revolution
One day the 12 year olds will rise and take over, forming an alliance with the grandmothers that read Caras
Stop it guys, you’re killing me
England - Castile was trying to invade Portugal with France's support, so we made an alliance and pushed them back
England was also an enemy of Castile and the Lancasters wanted to place one of them on the Castilian throne
The Treaty of Windsor was signed in 1386 and established a pact of mutual support between the countries
It's still active to this day and was used during the Napoleonic Wars, WW2 and the Falklands war
The alliance might go a little further back, during the Siege of Lisbon in1147 when English and other northern European crusaders – en route to the Holy Land to participate in the Second Crusade – stopped and helped Portuguese King to conquer the city from the Moors
England
helping with the reconquista and kicking the asses off kingdoms that would become Spain and later actually kicking Spanish ass
From our point of view, France and Spain seemed like they were old buddies
They kept teaming up
So you guys were Team Tulip
The ruler of Portugal at the time was the King of Spain Phillip II due to the succession crisis we had which ended up uniting both kingdoms under the Iberian Union
So I would wager that we didn't actually fight them and that we were actually being liberated by the English, we were forced to being under rule from a foreign power so that's why we were on opposite sides
Oh and BTW that union fucked Portugal a lot making us lose a lot of possessions to the Dutch and contibuting even more to the Spanish hate (not like we ever liked them but it got worse) that eventually lead to the Revolution of 1640 ([ in which the English came to our aid again and we kicked some major Spanish ass
I've recently read a book on the evolution of Horror and the Gothic stories written by Protestants during 17th and 18th centuries display this hatred for Catholics very well with stories about priests and Catholics committing rape, necrophilia, incest, etc, here's a quote:
"While horror may thus seem graphically to reduce the body to its material, a historical basis, it is important to remember that the way in which it does so is always historically defined and culturally specific: perceived as a threat to the process of national, Protestant identity-formation in the 18th century, Catholics in early Gothic fiction become the objects, sources and causes of horror par excellence

Our first king's father was from Burgundy, so thanks for that
Nice guy, very honorable
I'm yet to enter a Primark shop
You just see large crowds of people entering them on a daily basis and being given bags by people at the entrance or wtv the hell that is
It kinda creeps me out, to be honest
Sarcasm, word play, sexual innuendos and really self deprecating
So much that our jokes rarely involve foreigners but our own people,  from different parts os the country
Bacalhau (codfish), francesinhas and president Marcelo
I’m alentejano and I confirm this
Honestly yeah
Most countries in Europe seem to have dark, sarcastic, and self-deprecating humour
It's just the language barrier that makes it hard to notice
Our minister of health started crying recently during a speech about an institute that's part of the Portuguese National Health System
[video here] It's a sad video to watch and it's clear that she's exhausted and she's under tremendous pressure
I personally think she's doing the best she can with limited resources but people forget that it's a person in that position and are quick to dehumanize her
Edit: there's also a few years ago when Passos Coelho, our prime minister was interrupted by people singing the song about the carnation revolution after his austerity measures and overall cuts [video here] (starts at 0:25)
our health minister cried a bit last week but it was not a breakdown i think
However her office must be really on the limit
The health minestry is difficult for itself but this is just another level
I think the health secretary also cried last summer on the first day in months without covid deaths, which was clearly an escape because we all knew that it was not the end
I don't know if I should call it a nervous breakdown, but our infrastructures minister is completely batshit crazy and has anger issues
Every time he opens his mouth, he speaks has if he's about to punch the listener
[Here] he is saying that we shouldn't pay what we owe other EU countries (in the time of the crisis)
He says stuff like "The Germans and the French will tremble
I don't give shit  if they call us irresponsible
We have an atomic bomb to blow in the face of the French and the Germans
We don't pay
[Here] you can see how he answers another MP
Sarcastic, aggressive, threatening
This guy belongs to the party that ruined Portugal in 2008/2009 (which is in power again) and is the minister overseeing the TAP (plane travel company) crisis today, which will surely bring us back to 2008 numbers
This is why Portugal remains miserable: people keep voting for these retards
After atching that video I now understand why swedes call a argument that leads nowhere a “polish assembly”, it makes perfect sense
I was just reading some comments on the first video and god damn, people are ruthless
It always baffles just how arrogant some people are, sure governments do mistakes, they're humans after all, and there's a lot to hate but a so many people often act like they would run the country better while not even grasping the responsibilities and duties of governing millions of people
Don't forget the time the Prime Minister freaked out on a guy who said he was on holidays during the Pedrógão fires
Edit: [here (starts at 0:26)]
How did I not know about that second video
It gave me chills
You seriously post videos posted by a political party to talk about "nervous breakdowns"?? Please keep the libertarian propaganda in r/iniciativaliberal and r/Portugal
"Coutrim makes Pedro Nuno Santos go furious" it sounds like the shit "Feminist DESTROYED by FACTS and LOGIC" videos
If you want to talk about allowing TAP to go bankrupt go somewhere else
Lol not to mention the absolute smackdown Pedro Nuno Santos gives Coutrim in the second video lmao
"People pooling in their resources to help others in their community is a good thing, people pooling in their resources to give them to private medical corporations is not" - This part is gold, but I digress
People are cowards
that was the first it came to mind
Ah yeah I totally forgot about that, he almost punched the guy in question, post the video if you can
Is it a lie
Do you seriously think this man is acting accordingly to his position
I don't care where it comes from
This is not how a MP should behave
It's common sense
Edit: it's not propaganda
Only one of the videos is from Liberal
And I don't see how it's propaganda anyway
Am I trying to convince Europeans to vote Liberal in Portugal
And libertarian is totally different from liberal
Do you know that Vince McMahon meme, the WWE guy with all those face expressions
Well that’s me figuring out these stuff
>This is not how a MP should behave
It's common sense
It's a heated debate, I take it you haven't seen many debates if you think that that is agressive, maybe he was a bit rude, but so has your party been on multiple occasions, especially when it comes to your marketing campaign
What do you mean my party
I just chose the video dude, I didn't even see what channel was from
I just searched for videos with his name and title
This dude has behaved like this multiple times
These are 2 different videos, from different channels, many years apart
You're speaking like a fanatic
If it makes you feel better, I don't think IL outdoors are very tasteful aswell, but this is beyond the point
This dude acts erratic and there's no denying it
There's a small border town in Spain called Olivença (Olivenza in spanish) that used to be ours and according to a treaty from the XIX century should still be
Despite this border conflict, no one in Spain or Portugal really cares about it, and over time it became a meme
The joke consists mainly in saying that Olivença should be portuguese and that one day we'll invade Spain and reconquer it
There is even a romance and a drama play called "A Reconquista de Olivença" (The Reconquest of Olivença), that uses this meme as a metaphor for freedom, dreams, the future and the way we are governing the country and educating the youth
The justice system
Angola is ours
Marcelo is omnipresent
There's a saying about our former President Mário Soares: "Deus está em todo o lado, o Soares já lá esteve
" (God is everywhere, Soares has already been there
) I think we should add "e Marcelo já lá voltou" (and Marcelo has already come back)
Honestly I have a really hard time finding news in languages I understand for the whole continent
I follow Portuguese the closest, then British, then EU, then Spanish, then the rest
I’d love to know what’s going on in Estonia, Denmark, France, etc
but I can never find any sources that cover those places in languages I understand
I also despise the fact that 90% of “international” news sections are just whatever ridiculous thing is going on in America at the moment
True, but the other people have their fair share of idiocy too, albeit far smaller
The two party system is in itself a joke
Urban beach
It's a nightclub that you have a pretty good chance of being beaten up by the bouncers and there are rumours of human trafficking
Wow that would make a really good movie set
You can legally drink in Portugal once you turn 16, I believe
At least that was the case back when I was a teenager
You could legally purchase beer from a supermarket but not enter bars
Also, I remember a lot of people aged 16-17 back then going to nightclubs already
That being said, I remember a few kids from my class bragging about drinking alcohol when they were 12-13 still
And by the time you're 14-15 you're considered lame if you haven't tried alcohol yet
I didn't start drinking until I was 20 or so, which is considered VERY LATE
The part of Portugal I live in (Ribatejo) drinking is just a part of culture
First time I ever tasted alcohol, it was Port Wine, I was maybe 6-7
Most people I know already had drunken experience at maybe 13-14
Drinking isn't something cool kids do, it's a thing most do, cool or uncool
It's kinda sad but oh well
Alot
At around 15, sometimes 14 i ca clearly see that people have tasted alchool and drink it in a "regular" basis
Same in Portugal atleast where I live
That was the old law
Now it's only at 18 you can legally drink
It's illegal to sell alcoholic drinks to a minor in Portugal
I don't think it's illegal to buy them, but I'm not completely sure
He is talking sh*t(censoring for the kids who may be browsering here) That was the old law
Now it's only at 18 you can legally drink
Easy there, pal
I wasn't aware it was 18 these days
When I turned 18 about a decade ago it was still 16
So it's not like it's something that changed 50 years ago
suck my pila
From far-right Salazarists to communism, Portugal has it all
So, here's a [Wikipedia Link] there are 230 Deputies in the Parliament, but let's go from Right to Left:
CHEGA (Enough) \[1\] - Far-Right party, that has inconsistent policies, which is incredibly populistic and seems like it's trying to bring fascism back
Economically Right-wing unless they think that would be unpopular in that specific occasion
They only have one loudmouth in the parliament, but they seem posed to become the third biggest party eventually
CDS (Christian Conservatives) \[5\] - They are the standard conservative party that also panders to Catholics
Economically Right-wing
Dying party, probably going to be eaten by CHEGA
IL (Libertarian Party) \[1\] - Big fans of privatization, whilst being in favor of legalization of prostitution and drugs, standard libertarian stuff really
It has got only one elected Deputy
Maybe it will survive CHEGA, but it won't grow that much
PSD (Social Democrats - Center Right) \[79\] - Center party which becomes sort of a center-right party when it's forced to work with the parties to its right, at the moment it's the second biggest party and it probably won't leave its spot any time soon, still, it's being eaten by CHEGA
PAN (Green party) ~~\[4\]~~ \[3\] - Environmental party, doesn't hold an economic identity, it grew in the last election, maybe it will grow again
I'd wager that it probably won't, as every party seems to have gotten the global warming memo, but hey who knows, this is the most boring party to talk about by far
PS (Social Democrats - Center Left) \[108\] - Center party which becomes sort of a center-left party when it's forced to work with the parties to its left, at the moment it's the biggest party and it probably won't leave its spot any time soon, seems like it's growing and becoming the dominant force for at least the next decade if these trends are anything to go by
~~Livre (Europhile Left) \[1\]~~ \[0\] - Used to be a Left wing party that was Pro-Europe (they usually aren't), with all of its liberal and general left-wing economic ideas, but it kinda elected the most incompetent politician to ever hold office, she didn't know what her party's positions were, she didn't deliver the documents in time, she asked police to protect her from being asked questions by the journalists so her party threw her out, and her party has now no role in parliament, she's a free agent, and the party will probably die
Cool stuff, nice fun drama
OV (OG Green Party) \[2\] - They used to be the green party, until the new cool green party came, and now they are forgotten and dying, sad stuff
They should be gone any minute now, almost no one knows this party exists, they are always in a Coalition with the Communist Party, people think they are voting for the Communists, but surprise, a party you didn't know about is now in office
By the way, this one is the most boring party to talk about, I just forgot this one existed whilst writing the thing for PAN
BE (Left Bloc) \[19\] - A bunch of left-wing parties combined, with all of the general left wing economic and liberal ideas
They seem to be surging somewhat, absorbing the old dying commies
PCP (Communist Party) \[10\] - Left Wing economically, right about center in terms of liberal ideas, with an aging population they should be irrelevant in a few elections
&#x200B;
As for Pro or Anti Europe, every party from CDS to the former Livre is Pro-Europe, the others are Anti Europe
Don't you find that somehow undemocratic, since not every option is the same
In Portugal,  there is one ballot given at the polling station where every party that is running to the polls appears
You just make a cross in a square in front of the name of the party you want to vote for
For the ones not paying attention, Salvini is the 'italy is in need of a mass cleansing, street by street, quarter by quarter' guy
I wouldn't say that Chega is posed to be the third biggest party for a long time, imma be honest
They seem to be holding on to new fascists (of which there aren't that many) and to older people, unhappy with CDS's and PSD's  policies
But they crumble under the minimum civilized talk, it's all the gypsys' fault, those or immigrants
Much like PAN, I'm certain that they won't be growing for long
As for BE, I wouldn't say they're and have been absorbing communists (that sounds yummy)
They're mostly holding on to younger people with very consistent social priorities and not very developed economic thinking
And PSD is definitely not getting completely eaten by the fascists
Edit: sad u forgot my boi Santana Lopes :'(
Bem resumido, mas esqueceste-te de glorificar o nosso futuro lorde supremo o Exmo
Doutor André Ventura
Advice: better go to the sub's main page and pick a flair, much like my own, for us to better identify where you're from :p
Especially with PSD going more to the center thanks to Rio's weird leadership, giving those on the right wing of PSD no ground to stand, and with BE's future limited success, thanks to PS's success, I'd say CHEGA will gain the eventual third place
I'm obviously not happy about it, and I'd really like to be wrong on this
I don't mean that old commies are going to support BE, what I'm saying is that as old commies die, younger people (unfortunately) tend to choose BE over PCP, so PCP's irrelevancy is inevitably
And ya boy has no parliamentary representation, so he is irrelevant
Fica para a próxima, quando ele colocar aquela lei em que eu não posso falar mal dos polícias, dos juízes, dos guardas de prisão e provavelmente dele
Aí falarei bem do homem, porque assim a lei me diz
I see how it could be troublesome
In here we just vote for a party, wich means we
can be voting for whatever aparitchik that stands in #27 on the lists
I buy as many products as I can from my home country, using online shops (I am living abroad)
I feel I am doing my little bit to contribute to our economy that way
É justo
It translates to "Its fair", and its meaning is something like "ok, fair enough"
I would say “tá certo” which means you’re right/it’s right
>out of a pre-approved yet very comprehensive list
that list is too much comprehensive and it's kinda bullshit foreigners are allowed to write "alternative" spellings of Portuguese names
Oh God
I'm portuguese too, nothing to add to the question itself, though
Damn seeing so many people with regular full names
My parents decided to max it out at 6 (2 + 4 family names)
7 words total with the "de" ("of") in the middle of it all for good measure
It's a pain in official forms where you can't shorten it and it barely fits
Happy for the limit though
They tell the sad story of having to leave out 3 names they wanted to further shove into my poor person
Although it would feel weird if I had to change it for nationality reasons
Just FYI, the rule is 1-2 given names and at least 2 surnames (4 tops), so the child can chose which to use
They don't have to be the parents surnames
They can be a great-grand-parent' surname, a parent's given name, a place or profession that has to with the family, and so on
We have the most liberal naming conventions in the west
I moved from Portugal to Belgium a few years ago
It's common here to have more than 3 names (I know people with like 6 names) . Normally it's just a first and second name followed by mother's and father's surname
I don't know why but it's nearly impossible for university and administration staff to understand how my name works
In university documents they consider both my mother and father name together as my first name (no idea how that happened)
I had to go to the hospital and they would call me by my second to last name
In the gym my second name was forgotten
Somewhere else my first and second name were joined and become my first name
From that viewpoint, why doesn't Spain take responsability for their massacres in the Caribbean and South America
Or even my country for the massive amounts of Africans we enslaved
Because Colonial pasts are a problem in Europe
If you stop and look at the numbers, almost every European country that had a prominent colonial past doesn't acknoledge any past war crimes
Germany took action with the holocaust because it was a highlight, the freakin' second world war, man
The eyes of the world were turned to Germany and her allies in the 40's. They were either (most commonly) viewed as "The Evil Villain" or, in the case of Italy and Japan, "The Great General". There were WAY too many witnesses to Germany's war crimes to just cover it up
In short: ***If it's abroad, doesn't matter

If you had been born 200 years ago, what would you be doing in 1819
If you had been born 200 years before your actual birth, what would you be doing in 1819
Would you have been a farmer
A soldier
In my case, I have an autoimmune disease, so would have been dead
Thank you 21st century medicine
What would have been your fate
I would be a farmer, stuck in a marriage arranged by my parents and pregnant with my 9th son at 25
And since I wouldn't be rich enough, I would be working even with a huge belly
If I didn't die at birth I would probably be an emmigrant
My origins are mostly from the coastline, I would likely start working as a fisherman or some docks
There weren't a lot of factories in my area back then
By 1819, the country had been through 3 invasions by Napoleon and the countryside was economically devastated
A huge percentage of the population ran away to the colonies on whatever boat they could find
I would likely be one of them
Probably working in some huge farm in the middle of nowhere in Brazil
...I doubt I'd have a good life
Hauting my grave, since I would have died at age 8 from cancer lmao
My family was a noble one at the time, so I would probably be in some arranged marriage with some guy from some other noble family, opening my legs for him trying to give him a son stuck in a society that had way to many rules in everyday life
Either the same thing I'm doing today, studying law to become a lawyer or be in the navy or working has lawyer but doing poetry on free time (like many poets did back then, getting a job to be able to live and doing poetry)
Probably alive until my late 60 i guess, since my only allergy is to penicillin, and if i was working has a lawyer i would have a safe job that would increase my chances of surviving
I would've been a soldier and fight for the best president my country ever had António de Oliveira Salazar
I was diagnosed when I was 22, so I would have probably have 2 or 3 kids before I died as well
Also, I would have likely been a farmer too or a fisherman's wife
In England
If you didn't die during the voyage
Fernando VII
I've edited the question, if you had been born 200 years before your actual birth, what would you be doing in 1819
1819, dude
Salazar was born in 1889
And the poor, the sick, the women, the injured, POC
basically 90% of the population
salazar was president in 1932 if i was born in 1819 that would make me 113 years old the oldest person in the world to ever exist was 116 years old so that means i would see salazar become president(best moment in the Portugal history)  and i would still be able to fight for him for 3 years and deffend him from the capitalism's idiots
what a great life i would had
Both my grandmothers were married at the age of 18 and 19
We're from rural Northern Portugal, very, very Catholic (which I also am, but it's not a problem to my family that I remain unmarried nowadays), getting married at an earlier age was the only way you got out of your parents house and gained some semblance of independence
Absolutely
There is one democratic government of China and it resides in the Island of Taiwan
We've seen how the communist regime treats democracy or disent on countless ocasions but unfortunately our governments always follow real politik and chose to side with the opressive regime of the continent in exchange for cheap consumer products
You are not a legitimate government because you win a war
You are the legitimate government  when the people is heard and chooses who will rule
Probably and most likely
Democracy works that way but at least people would have a voice
There's two versions
One says he lives in Lapland, Finland and the other says he lives in the North Pole
Santa's from Lapland
That's what I've always heard
Lapland is often dubbed as "terra do pai natal" (santa claus' Land), when talking to children
The usual saying is that he lives somewhere in the North Pole
When I was a kid my mom also used to say he lived in Lapland,Finland
Here too
At least according to my mom
Santa lives in Lapónia (don't know what's the actual name of the that region in Finland)
Edit: I'm dumb, it's Lappland
When I was young, the one that brought all the presents to the children was Baby Jesus, Menino Jesus
My grandmother used to say which presents came from her baby Jesus, to signal the presents that came from her
It sounds very Santa Clausy in Finish
Not sure if it counts but a tourist/client once asked me how to get to the other side of the island
In mainland Portugal
In the Azores, more specifically in the Oriental Group, some people think that you can just walk from one island to the other when the tide is low
It also pisses me off when anyone comes to Portugal thinking that we belong to Spain or speak spanish (we don't)
I saw a vlogger saying it's tradition to drink a ginginha (cherry liquor), in the morning cause it's medicine
No one drinks in the morning
People often stare at foreigners drinking early in the day and go like "look at those weirdos, drinking so early
Note: ginginha is "medicine" for throat ache, cause it's sweet and (should) have honey
This sounds like something I would do
Asian tourists are generally clueless
Context:
- once again we do not fucking speak Spanish, not even as a second language, it's not like some former Soviet republics where people speak Russian as a second language
- younger people is Portugal, specially in urban centres tend to be well educated, and a large majority of university students in Lisbon speaks, if not perfect, reasonable English
One time I was working as a tourist helper person (if that's even the name), in Rossio, in the centre of Lisbon
I was with this girl, let's call her Raquel
Well, two Americans came to us, full of bags and shit, it looked like they had just landed
Came right to us being all like _¡Hola
_ and _¿Cómo estás?_ with a very heavy American accent
Then they just stoped in front of us, started talking to each other in English saying like 'take out the dictionary', and the guy said something in the lines of 'do you really think they speak any English here
This is the only city they got
They don't even got trains here' Bear in mind that we got plenty of other cities, Rossio is the place of one large ass train station and both of us were wearing shirts that said 'I SPEAK ENGLISH' on the back (in capital letters) and had cards pinned to the chest saying 'I speak' and then a (in my case) Union Jack and both a Portuguese and french flags
Well, this people looked at us, looked at the dictionary and at us, again, and started trying to speak some sort of Anglo-spanish thing
Raquel was becoming really red and angry
She looked at them and went like 'If I were in New York, would like me to go to you and ask you stuff in Spanish saying to your face your not smart enough to speak English
', a little 'uncalled' for, I know, but we were both fed up with those pricks
They just walked out all mad like 'they're dumb and rude blablablablabla'.
I only had to read that it was a video to know which one it was
...does it have a backdoor
Desenrascar
It means to sort something out; to achieve something given the resources or what you have at hand
Like [this
It’s a really useful word
Portugal **caralho**!
"Portugal damn it" is too soft
Sobremesa is postre in Portuguese
After tomorrow is similar
I was hoping to find the classic “[saudade] a unique word from Portuguese speaking countries and Galicia
As explained by A. F. G. Bell in 1912: “The famous saudade of the Portuguese is a vague and constant desire for something that does not and probably cannot exist, for something other than the present, a turning towards the past or towards the future; not an active discontent or poignant sadness but an indolent dreaming wistfulness
But I love love love the art of “desenrascanço”. Also- such a great word to say
Can’t think of an example
What’s the first that comes to your mind
A favourite expression
Also my mood 24/7
Extremely widespread
[This type of building (if you can say that) that you can encounter in Seixal]
If 16th century european architects would travel in time to see those buildings, they would have an hart attack
This one hurts the eyes
Ahahahah isto nem pode contar
No fundo todos sabemos que isto nem acabou de ser construído, mas compreendo porque isto está aqui
Vivem pessoas aí?
When's construction done
I know, it was a joke
Yes, as an optional class
Usually Catholic, but other religions can be taught if there are enough students wanting to do it
I'm Portuguese
The class is available if you want your kid to take it
It's called Moral and Religious Education
It is supposed to teach about your particular religion
I don't think so
Religion is not something to be imposed on children
Their families influence is already bad enough influence on kids
Let them be free to choose whatever they wish to believe in
Moral, aka viagens ao aquashow e n fzr um crlh
é a maneira de convencerem os alunos a não anularem a disciplina para terem mais tardes livres
It depends on what you mean by "religious literacy". If that means smth like teaching kids what Sunni and Shia Islam is, for example, I'd be all in
The problem is that teaching that without getting into preaching is very hard and I don't trust teachers to do that
I don't want my kids to get indoctrinated at school just bcs a good intended Jewish, Muslim, Christian, etc
teacher wanted to show them "the word of God", just no
That's not neither the teacher's nor the school's job
School's supposed to educate and since this is a secular state, we should teach secularism
That doesn't mean teaching atheism, btw, it means secularism

In almost a millennium of history, we had many capitals, including Rio de Janeiro
But the two options are:
Guimarães: that's where Portugal was born
Coimbra: It's been there since the Romans
It's the home of one of the oldest universities in Europe
It's basically Portugal's Oxford
I think both these cities have been capitals at one point or another
Edit: I think Lisbon is just fine
I'm very happy that my capital is the second oldest city in Europe (after Athens) and it's even mentioned in pre-roman times in greek texts
Besides, its history speaks volumes about what Portugal is really about
Porto, because the name of the country literally comes from that city (as it was the capital of the County of Portucale)
Lisbon is not even one of my top 10 favorite portuguese citys, but I don't see any other possible capital for our country, mostly Lisbon is the best option because of its size and Central location
Porto
It's realistically the only other city that has capital-level infrastructure, but Lisbon has a better position (more central) for a capital (more central)
Also, in my completely biased opinion it is the most beautiful city in Continental Portugal (Açores and Madeira are also really beautiful)
However, with how hot the Porto vs Lisbon rivalry is already, the country would burn
By the same logic, let me try
Madrid: oh, no
Rome: fuck, even worse
Well, we do have the oldest alliance in the world with the British
So London
Goddamn it
Doesn't work for us ahaha
Genève all the way baby
Yeah, Lisbon
Makes more sense as a capital for many reasons
Coimbra wound't be a bad option because is central and is an old historic city with a cultural and historical significance
Porto is a great city but is too northern to be a capital and Guimarães doesn't make sense  is also too northern and Braga bigger and older city in the region and is a more important city overall the only thing Guimarães has over Braga is that was the first capital
We provide warm and sunny weather and lovely beaches for our fellow northern neighbors to visit, relax and boost our economy lel
Edit: I remembered we provide cheap, quality labor in all areas but mostly tech
We also provide nice shoes, wine and tea produced in the Azores
We were the ones that exported the Roman Empire true to oceans to the world (Europe in other words)
We had a colossal impact in terms of riches that Europe collected, we had and still have one of the largest gold reserves in the world
We also have a huge ocean territory with an important geopolitical location
Right now we provide cheap tourism lol
Poland have an important geographical location, it’s cheaper in terms of transportation, any European country can get there and move to some place else with the goods
so, you mean, meaningless :(
Thank you for your gratefulness, kind baguette warrior
We appreciate your cheese
>Also, leather
Everyone I know who works in leather says you guys are the
Huh
Have you searched how much of European funds come to build those highways
Please do
Have you searched how much European funds come to improve the Polish industries
Please do
And the iron tower
Apart from sometimes having to wait for some procedures, I can't see any downside
In my opinion, if we didn't have the Universal health care many of us probably couldn't have even basic procedures done
I'd like that the waiting time didn't exist but, not having an universal health care system would be much worse
Not really
Perhaps the ironic thing is that you also get properly priced private healthcare
Well, taxes
But you either pay public healthcare for all or private for you, so it's the same
People abusing the system
Like hypochondriacs
LOL
Many of what you said is simply not true
Please do some more research before making such claims
Same here
It's called a "moderator fee", where you pay a symbolyc 20€ per day you spend at the emergency that only gets charged if it's not an emergency (i.e. it's a critical issue and/or you need to stay more than 10 days until they find out what's wrong with you)
It's essentially a hypochondriac tax
Here there's definitely both situations happening
how words in Italian change genders going from singular to plural
Spellings in French and English
Quatre-vingt
I mean, there's a few non-indo-european languages spoken in Europe, but their native speakers probably think most other European languages are nonsensical as well
That's weird
I always thought we either sounded like mid-atlantic Oxford wannabees or like mid-atlantic Mobsters wanabees
I mean Russian is obviously a dialect of Portuguese, but it doesn't carry to our English
Even more fascinating is that almost every portuguese can understand Spanish quite well but Spanish people don't understand a word of portuguese
And the vocabulary is almost the same
A friend of mine went to Sevilla with his friends and he was talking portuguese, then a Spanish guy asks them "where are you from
I Guess from your accent that you're from russia". And this happens just 100 kms away from Portugal
> *(plus)nineteen*
Ten(plus)nine
Have you heard Portuguese
If so tell if at first you thought it sounded like Russian or not because someone people say that Portuguese sounds like Russian (even though the languages have nothing in common, although Portuguese has a few fonectic sounds unique in Europe)
I'm quite interesting in knowing if you guys think it sounds similar
Honestly your comment and the one before are the truest things in the world
When I go abroad and talk portuguese with people back home, I’ve had people hear me and ask if it was russian
I am Portuguese and can confirm most Portuguese people do not speak like that
I'm pretty sure the guy who is speaking is just not comfortable with the language
>And as for Portugese - I love the language, it's so, so beautiful
*Happy Portuguese noises
Thanks for the complement, now i feel bad for not knowing Croatian to compliment back xP but i will listen and then give an opinion
Edit: i have listened a bit of Croatian now, i like how it sounds, it strange but beautiful, i like the sound of it, the sounds are strange but they mix well idk really well how to explain but sounds really good it's beautiful
We stress the vouls a lot, i assume Russian does that too, so that might explain the similarities in the phonetics is my guess
Let me have some of that cool w**h**ip
Is that good
I have several questions and I don't really know where to start with
How
Why
Are you sure you mean sex and not sexy
How did you come up with that idea
What's your opinion on Portuguese, be brutally honest, does it sound good or bad middle of the road
Oooooooh XP that's interesting
Thanks xP
Not a really interesting one but still: the Euro crisis, I wanna learn more about the reason why I needed to wait 10 years to buy a Wii because I couldn't buy one in 2009 because everyone was broke
Anything that happened east of Spain more than 150 years ago
The whole Ottomans reaching Vienna thing
Don't remember it ever being mentioned at school
I should introduce you to my mother then
She's obsessed with that time period and has tons of books on it
Yeah, if not for the internet I wouldn't have known about this
Which is a shame
I'm going to go ahead and admit that I'm unsure whether if I even know the basics
Thanks for that, I sure heard of European banks dying, the crisis killed 4 banks here in Portugal
Possibly even more
I read that he took credit for Italys pensions scheme when actually it had been made up by factory workers and "sindacato" buy he basically renamed it and presented it as his
I live in Italy now
And it's sad to see some people defend him
The amount of brainwashing that must have gone on is unreal
Also a lot of older people born post war are called Benito
So this is right about the most portuguese thing one could imagine
In 1998 the second bridge over the Tagus River was finished (Vasco da Gama Bridge) and it was a national event
It was the largest bridge in Europe, finished in the year when Portugal hosted the World Expo, so it was a big year for us, at least publicity-wise
So in order to commemorate the inauguration of the largest bridge in Europe, we achieved another world record: the biggest table in the world
[17
000 people were invited to attend a lunch of Feijoada IN THE BRIDGE] and I bet some people in Portugal don't even know this (I just found out recently)
So yeah, we inaugurated a bridge with a mega lunch in the bridge itself, for 17
000 people
Very portuguese
In the XV century, our king sent a spy to try to gather information along the silkroad on how to get spices in India and to spy on the Muslim kingdom's along the way
He was gone for 40 year's and was assumed dead, until he was found as an old men in Ethiopia by a later Portuguese expedition
He had a high position in court and had his own harem
Along the way he visited Spain, Morocco, Italy, Greece, Egypt, Sudan, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, India, Mozambique, Iran, Eritrea and Ethiopia
His name was Pero da Covilhã and he was a Renaissance James Bond
You should check more about his travels because they are quite fantastic
We threw out of a window the Galizian noble who was the lover of the Queen, in order to establish a bastard master of the Order of Avis as our king
He took the 'be the change you want to see in the world' too literally
I wish I was alive back then so that I could go and eat my well deserved feijoada on top of that huge ass brige ahahah this is gold
Sorry, circumcision ceremony with a submarine
Most republics with a Prime Minister tend to also have a President, albeit with mostly ceremonial powers
You can't sue me
I'm a cardenal now
At least for me, it's the 25th of April which marks the freedom day when the Salazarist dictatorship was overthrown
People listen [Grândola Vila Morena] and some get carnations, the revolution synbol
Pre covid, people used to march along the Avenida da Liberdade
Great day, although fascists don't like it
But fuck them
Now, if I had to choose a day/moment EVERYONE liked and celebrated, it would be the 10th July 2016, when Portugal won the European cup with Eder's goal
What a memorable day
"É FERIADO HOJE CARALHO"
Liberty Day, 25th April, next sunday, but the typical celebration is restricted to just few people and I think it's going to be raining this year :(
As far as I'm concerned, fascists don't count as "some people". 25 of April is obviously the most celebrated day because of all the festivities and events going on
In Portugal we have a large period of celebrations
Traditionally, people would set up their Christmas decorations on the 8th of December (Feast of the Immaculate Conception)
Nowadays, people usually set up their decorations whenever they like (usually 1st of December)
The traditional Christmas decoration is the "Presépio" ("Nativity Scene")
Some people will have a small one, with only the Holy Family, but others will have larges ones, with various figures such as villages, shepherds, the three wise kings and folk characters
Kids will usually include some of their own (when I was younger I would put a Wall-e toy and a Mega-Man toy I had on our Presépio)
Some regions have their own presépios (in my region, Algarve, the traditional presépio is not a Nativity Scene, but an image of a young Jesus, not baby, with various fruits and plants decorating)
Christmas trees are also a very common element
However, this tradition is more recent (it begun in the 70s I believe)
Another Christmas decoration (now falling out of use) is a seara
It is planting a small vase with wheat so that when Christmas comes, the wheat is all grown up
On the last day of school, most schools organize a Christmas party, where students sing for their parents or act in Christmas plays
Some days before Christmas there's the legendary "Natal dos Hospitais" (Hospitals' Christmas)
It is a TV broadcast from various hospitals throughout the country
Famous portuguese singers, presenters, comedians and other figures go to the hospitals to celebrate Christmas with those who can't be at home because of work or heath issues, and that's broadcasted nationwide
It's usually directed towards children, but everyone loves it, as it is a really heartwarming moment
The traditional Christmas meal ("Consoada") is eaten during the evening of Christmas Eve (usually a dinner)
Codfish (the famous Bacalhau) is the traditional dish, but other dishes can also be eaten (tuna, lamb, turkey are examples)
In my region (Algarve) the traditional dish is octopus
The main dish is usually accompanied by other foods such as shellfish, wild meats, snacks, etc
At the end, various deserts are served, the most famous of these is the Bolo Rei ("King Cake")
On the cake there will be a small token or figure and a bean hidden
When eating the cake, if you come across the token in your slice, you get to keep it
But if you find the bean, you have to buy next year's cake
After the meal, traditionally, people would go to the Missa do Galo ("Mass of the Rooster"), a special catholic mass that begins exactly at midnight
At the end of this mass, everyone kisses an image of Baby Jesus (I hope they don't do this one this year xD), which is then placed at the Presépio (Nativity Scene) of every church
After this, people go home, put their image of Baby Jesus in their presépios and open their presents
This obviously is a very traditional and religious thing, and nowadays people don't attend this mass as they used to, preferring to stay at home socializing with family and watching movies or Christmas programmes on the TV
Some families open their presents on the morning of the 25th
Traditionally, Baby Jesus brings the gifts
Nowadays, Father Christmas (our version of Santa Claus) brings it
Most people will leave a treat on the table for Father Christmas (like milk and cookies)
In some regions, it's traditional to leave other things, like wine
In the Algarve, the tradition is to leave a shoe
On Christmas day, it's traditional to have another big meal, this time lunch
Each region also their own traditional things
The most famous is the one in Penamacor, where people steal trees and burn them in the church yard
In my region, people usually go for a dive on the beach on the morning of the 25th
On the first weeks of January, it's traditional to sing the Janeiras
A group of people go home to home singing songs
They are then given food and treats
If they like the treats they sing song praising whoever gave them
If they don't, they sing songs joking about them
Someplaces will have the people singing in a single spot, and everyone can come and watch them
On the 6th of January we celebrate the Epiphany
Portuguese too
If I saw an old lady with a stache then yeah, I guess, but since we ain't an ethno state and kinda of are literal brothers with Spain, not really
[men] [women] Although the dead give-away would be a short-person, brown-green eyes and a tan
[Here are the tipical phenotype of the Portuguese people,scroll down to see]
I honestly think French people are the hardest to pinpoint
They just look "European".
I think Nordic people have a very distinctive brow
The eyes and eyebrows are a give away, if you're not sure about the blonde hair
I showed this to my girlfriend and asked what she thought
She instantly said Greek
I asked why
She said the tan, the moustache and the navy vibe gave it away
I don't think Cristina Ferreira gives the right look of a Portuguese woman but Rui Unas is spot on (with or without the stache)
I can spot "come-ons" from a mile away, ahaha
(come-ons, "cámones", it's the name we give to British tourists)
I don't know much about makeup, but if you had a bunch of white girls wearing heavy makeup all in a row I could probably point out which one is British
There's like a specific style of slapper specific to Britain
I beg to disagree
Typical Lisbon mom type
Based on some statistics, I hypothesize what you've been noticing is depression
The most visited city is Lisbon, the most visited region is Algarve and the Portuguese tourists tend to go more to the "North region". There is the sanctuary of Fátima that attracts a lot of people
I'd say Lisbon, Porto and the Algarve region (specifically the coast)
Lisbon and Porto seemed to have become really popular in recent years
I lived in Lisbon for a year some years ago and it had a lot of visitors but not a crazy amount, yet every time I go there to see my friends I notice more and more tourists
The whole Baixa area is so busy nowadays (well apart from this year that is), and you can even find tourists in other parts of the city where you wouldn't expect them
Lisbon and Porto tend to attract the more cultured tourists (for lack of a better word) whereas the Algarve tends to attract people who want sun and sand
People, both national and international, primarily go there for the beaches
While not as bad as some parts of Spain and Greece, you still get a lot of trashy tourists particularly in places like Albufeira
The barrocal and mountainous parts of the region go virtually ignored
The Algarve focuses a lot on tourism and so this year it's been hit very hard
As for Scotland, after having lived in Edinburgh for a year I can tell you the city centre is packed with tourists
It's even busier during the Fringe festival in August
Also I found the Isle of Skye to be pretty packed as well
The Algarve, our southern coast, is pretty much British territory
Or at least it was before covid, rip
Lisbon and Algarve, for sure
But due to Corona Virus a lot of portuguese are spending their holidays in the interior which is also gorgeous ️
In Portugal it's the two big cities, Lisboa and Porto and the summer "paradise" is in Algarve, in the south of the country
Particularly Albufeira and Vilamoura
In Portugal basically have various spots, usually people start with Porto, Lisbon or Algarve
In an order, for example if people start from the North, go to Porto, then visit wine cellars there, Lello Library, D. Luís Bridge, Sé and walk around or go to a sightseeing bus
Then, some go to Guimarães or Braga, if not, some go to Aveiro, Coimbra and/or Fátima
Then Lisbon and Sintra
Algarve people go to stay there at an apartment and stay there to go to the beach and stuff
And then, in the end go to the archipelagos of Madeira and Azores
Lisbon and Porto for the "normal tourist" and Algarve for the drunk british ones
Probably not the most touristy area, but in the Azores you can see tourists everywhere, no matter the season
I live in Lisbon and I can assure the amount of tourists during the summer was crazy, everything full from restaurants to the museums
it’s not always “cultured tourists” since a part of them were young people sleeping on hostels and pensions = spending less money therefore not providing much to the economy
Yeah "cultured" isn't the best word and I was struggling to find a way to describe them as they're not exactly the same as your typical Algarve tourist
I know some names
Many times can't relate cities to states, unless they are the really famous ones like Chicago, Illinois or Los Angeles, California
I don't really know to be honest
I believe I know them all, but then I like knowing stuff about a lot of countries
If I were to mention a state to somebody else over here then I'd probably add an ", America" just so that they know what I'm talking about, the exceptions being states like California, Texas, Florida, and New York which I think are generally known
I can name and put on the map almost all of them
But europeans in general aren't able to name or locate most of them (the same way americans can't do it with most European countries)
And Shawn Michaels from WWE I think
I found both French and German to be harder than English
Latin was also hard
Proudly european
Considering all the economical suport, yes
However, sometimes it looks like we are better of without then
I cried a bit reading this
Top of my head cant remember, but at least anti-vaxx i know they have 0 popularity
Everyone believes vaccines work and we good
You're forgetting the famous case on TVI's kids show "Batatinha e Companhia
" On how TVI is hiding all the information on what happened
>So he got drunk and took his butcher knife (he was a butcher) und chopped of his own right thumb so
He couldn’t use guns anymore and therefore he didn’t get drafted
That's a way to escape drafting
But hell, I couldn't chop my own thumb off even if it meant my life lol
It's a mixed bag
Aside from most of it being written in Brazilian Portuguese, some articles could definitely use a bit of work
Not only are they lacking information in comparison to English Wikipedia, some of the writing is very unprofessional
Proper Brazilian Portuguese is fine because it's very much understandable aside from some differences it has with European Portuguese, but as soon as it starts becoming less formal it becomes harder to read
Also, many articles feel like they have to shoehorn a section into how the topic in question relates to Brazil (and sometimes Portugal and other lusophone countries)
I generally stick to English Wikipedia as it's much more comprehensive, professional, and easier to understand
It also contains a lot more sources
I only really use Portuguese Wikipedia when I'm looking for information that's more relevant to lusophone countries
Too much Brazilian portuguese for my taste, except for articles that specifically talk about Portugal and portuguese things inly portuguese people would know about
So I just use the English language version instead
I find Wikipedia very useful to translate some subjects for example animals, plants, thecnical stuff
So I usually navigate between English, Portuguese and Spanish
Definitely wiki in Portuguese it's only good to see the résumé and if I want a more detailed version i go to the English version
There's normally some mistakes that a associate to the fact that it's written by Brazilians
The Spanish version usually its very good although in some more obscure subjects not so complete as the English version
Well, because of Brazil I search very easily wikipedia ij Portuguese
But the PT-BR has a noticeble different grammar and words, it aproaches 18th century PT-PT and has some Spanish and Italian features, so in Portugal you must be very careful if you using an wikipedia article for school
I only use it for my native language to search for things related to my country it's more complete and historical accurate (besides sometimes completely butchering it) for the rest English
It's awful, I only use it for articles about Portugal, usually other articles are too jarring to be comfortably read IMO
The Portuguese one is mostly good (tho  ironically most is in brazilian portuguese and not european one,.
When it comes to important subjects it is usually very complete and informative
However when it comes to less important subjects it can be way to brief and incomplete or just not that well written or even outdated
Since i can understand English fairly well i usually just use the English version as it is often more complete unless i want to know about something related to Portugal in specific or if the English article features to many technical words i'm not used to
Same thing, there's just way more content in the english pages
They’re not mistakes, it’s just written in Brazilian Portuguese, which has a slightly different grammar and vocabulary
I use the English one almost exclusively because of the Brazilian grammar
Nothing against Brazilians, but it looks weird and it's a confusing read at times
> it aproaches 18th century PT-PT
That is a myth, or rather, a misinterpretation
If you look to old portuguese texts you will notice that the grammar is more similar to modern day european portuguese, like the use of the second person and the use of verb-pronoun (like "vi-te" instead of "te vi")
The only exception would be the more prominent use of the gerund ("vendo") which is more commonly used in Brazil (although still used in some Portuguese regions)
In the 18th century, most educated and high class Brazilians would use the same grammar that we use nowadays
There is also the fact that Brazilian Portuguese has a lot more loan words, especially from English, african and native languages which did not influence that much European Portuguese
What is theorized is that the Brazilian accent MIGHT have been similar to old Portuguese, not the grammar, but even that is disputed
It is also important to add that the Brazilian accent varies greatly from region to region and throughout history
For example, here is a video of someone speaking in 19th century Brazilian Portuguese:
Notice the hard R's. It matches to Eça de Queirós' description of the Brazilian accent of the time
Also notice that the grammar is far more similar to European Portuguese than modern day Brazilian Portuguese
It is depending where you live
I can't drink the tap water at my home, but at my friend's (who lives in the next town over) house I can
In Edinburgh I used to drink tap water all the time, in fact I found it tasted a lot better than bottled water over there
It's normal but it's also normal to drink bottled water
Some people really don't like tap water though
And at restaurants you pretty much always get bottled water unless you specifically ask for tap water, which most people don't.
And yeah, tap water is chlorinated here so it does taste a bit chemical
Though I guess I'm sensitive to that because I grew up drinking bottled water at home
I tend to drink tap water nowadays though
But for instance Swedish tap water is incredible, and it tastes more like our bottled water
And on the other hand I find some foreign bottled waters (e.g. Evian) quite bad tasting and more reminiscent of our tap water (but worse)
I think they've got more minerals than our bottled waters
So this varies a bit by country
Yes, I only drink bottled water when I'm outside without my personal bottle with tap water
excluding that one time when my home town was hit by *legionella* and no one could drink or use pipe water
very sad times
In Portugal, tap water quality depends a bit on where you are
In and around Lisbon, tap water is pretty good
But in the South, tap water has kind of a weird flavour to it, and most people buy 4L bottles of water for drinking and cooking
I'm not sure about the North or in the Azores and Madeira, but I'm guessing it might be different
Here in Portugal, sparkling water always comes in green bottles
I found out this wasn't the case everywhere the hard way
Let me guess, mismanagement of EU funds
Covid Will change that
Not in a good day, but the airbnbs will be empty and prices will go down
I feel like this is a problem in so many places throughout Europe
I wonder if there could ever be a ban on stag and hen parties (the problematic kind that is) in the continent considering the problems they cause
I believe some Spanish islands are trying to deal with drunk idiots by issuing curfews and other measures, and it would be great for that to be implemented all around Europe
I mean I like partying and getting drunk but not if it causes problems for other people around me
We have the same problem here in Lisbon
Is between Madrid and Barcelona a valley in a mountainous area
Those who live there say they enjoy the best of both worlds and a peaceful place in an hour is in Madrid or Barcelona
Main steps:
1) pick up all the latin vocabulary you know (mostly words in Spanish)
2) substitute "gracias" by "obrigado" and use it as much as you can, portuguese people appreciate that
3) forget the days of the week you have learned in other latin languages - except for saturday and sunday - and substitute them for ordinal numbers (ex: monday - the second - segunda, tuesday - the third - terça, etc
4) Grammatical connectors are verbal
When you are speaking, instead of using a comma and a point in the end of the sentence, you use "caralho" as a comma and "foda-se" as a point
You can also use "puta que pariu" when you want to add some expressivity to the phrase
5) A large part of the nouns ending in "-ion" in spanish, end in "-ão" in portuguese -if you have trouble saying this just imagine you'd like to scare someone
(Ex: communication - comunicacion - comunicação)
6) Pick all the Spanish vocabulary you know, add some italian accent and in the top use closed vowels like the russians do
Now your accent is good enough
Now you're able to learn portuguese
Edit: step 4) is pretty much applied in the north of the country, not so in the south
In Portuguese, city is also feminine
"A cidade"
Para usar esses conectores deves ser do norte
Step 4 is very important
Easier
First, be Russian, second, get drunk and finally try to speak Spanish
Done
For 5), I think it helps to pronounce the -ão like the "oun" in the middle of the word "sound
" Pronounce the word, but take the 's' and the 'd' sounds out, and you got it
Como é evidente
Devia ter especificado que isso usa-se mais no norte
Better
I saw this on [YouTube] and was pretty funny
Just imagine you are a Spanish guy flerting with a russian girl, you spent the night together and 9 months later you have a baby
That's how you do portuguese accent
That's right, not even romanian is that different from other latin languages
We just use latin derived terms for saturday (sábado) and sunday (domingo)
Mas muito boa explicaçãoahahah
Yeah it's really closed
What about the rest
The message above and so
Is it too hard
Also, the suffix "-zione" in italian turns to "-ção" in portuguese
I have been in Erasmus in Italy and was very easy for me to understand
After 3 or 4 months without having italian classes I could speak normally with an italian
My Spanish friends also chose to have their classes in italian rather than in English, because it's much easier for them
That's nice, to know our languages are more closer than i thought
Why a large european state cannot be built
USA: 300 million people, one official language (of course I know there are a lot of spanish speakers, but English is the only official language)
Europe:
Belgium - 11 million people, 3 languages
Switzerland - 8 million people, 4 languages
All the other countries have their own language, some of them their own currency, some have monarchies, some have republics
It is impossible to bring this together into one single state
In Portugal too, because we are at the Western tip, we sometimes feel excluded from the rest of Europe, as most of the action happens in Central Europe
I'm guessing Russia also had/has this feeling
Ok, bringing Belgium and Switzerland to the topic was a way to prove our cultural diversity comparing to the USA
Actually, things work there and I hope it continues like that
But now imagine bringing together about 50 languages and eliminate currencies like the Sterling pound or the swiss franc
Also the EU integrates 27 of 50 countries, there is no territorial coesion
Do you still it would work
And would you include just the EU state members or all the countries in Europe
I'm not being pessimistic, I'm just fine with the way things work right now
We have the same currency, free movement between our countries, cooperative policies, why complicate
Come on dude give us a break
we spent a lot of time fighting off spanish and french kingdoms just for the sake of our existence in the span of like seven hundred years
Plus the CEP (Corpo Expedicionário Português) was a thing in WWI
A militarized force of 10000 men, that was totally obliterated by superior German strategy and firepower in 1916 in Belgium if I’m not mistaken
We did sat out in WWII but hey I guess Salazar sympathized with the likes of his kind back then
We participate in WWI
I didn't happen on our soil (outside of African territories), but we didn't sat them out
Portugal fought in WW1
Of course cooperation is better than just blocking each other
My point is that is impossible to create a "United States of Europe" because countries want to remain independent in some issues and there is a lot of nationalist feeling through the different countries
Don't get me wrong, I completely believe and support the EU project and the Euro currency, but I think a full integration now would be a step backwards
Seems a plausible point
I think a common army would be interesting
A stronger parliament is difficult while people there are speaking different languages
But I agree with you on that point, Europe should have more power in international decisions
That is quite allright dear ol chap, no worries
Let’s put some shrimp on the barbie and just forget about it
No worries
Doable
If we say we're thirsty they say drink a wall
If we say we're cold they say go to your uncles bed
If we say we're hungry they say eat a man
I think it makes more sense in portuguese because it all rhymes
Nah still weird
If you pick your nose: "Is there going to be a party
You're cleaning the ballroom
If you cry excessively after a small injury: "Careful, your bowels are going to come out of there
If you sulk: "Little goat pouted, went to the hill and never came back
" in song
If the house is chaotic/ a mess: "What is this
Mother Joana's house
If you run inside the house and fall: "Well done
" (Bem feito
É bem feito
If you're good and do all your chores and homework: "You did nothing more than your obligation
When you ask what the dinner is, and they don't really know, every mother says it's "asker's tongues"    pt=linguas de perguntador
We say: Do you have a big ass
Here we say: "This looks like a pigsty
" or "It looks like the dog's house
You leave the door open: "are you from Braga
In Portugal or Germany
In Portugal it's "are you from Braga"
In Portugal
I never heard "are you form Braga" in my life
Maybe is a regional difference
Were in Portugal are you from
North
I'm from the north west coast side, and you are
Im from south Portugal so maybe is that
Braga is not a city we realy think about down here
Gaia, caralho
As far as i know it is illegal to pee in the ocean in portugal
It's a code violation to call a bathroom a bathroom without a bidet
Bidet-less service bathrooms are okay, but you must have a full-one to sell a house (I believe this is also true in Spain and Italy, the only other two civilised countries)
Mas há alguém que cumpre
Faço isso mil vezes e ainda não fui preso ou darem me uma multa
Do you call the virus coronita as well or has the entire country gone criminal
I think we can 80% of the time, not to say more because i'm not sure
Btw, as a portuguese, that thing you said about your languages written form being based on portuguese is interesting
Could you explain more what you mean or why do you think that
Not all the time, there are some homophone sounds
The big one is à/há which everybody confuses every once in a while when writing fast
H at the beginning of a word is silent in portuguese but há is a verb and à is a preposition+article
Otherwise we might confuse ge/gi with je/ji because G has the sound of a J before e and i.
We might also confuse ç or c before some vowels with s (ss) or -s- between vowels with -z-
The letter -x- is a mess
Most words have an univocal spelling though there are some sources of confusion
I'm portuguese and yes most words are pretty easy to write after hearing them, I never really thought that that must be difficult for other languages
In Portuguese
Probably
In English
50/50
The way we pronounce the letter "o" at the of words isn't the same "o" we pronounce in the alphabet
Wow i didn't know about that, i was searching for it now and its very interesting
These diacritcs seem to be like the chinese tones or am i wrong
I also noticed you seem not to have all the consoants we have like the F (although i didn't notice if you had some we didn't)
That's true but you can still spell them easily
As a native speaker, it's intuitive
I forgot to mention, but the letter "s" also has different sounds, depending on where it is located in a word
I have some explanations/conjectures for those:
* Nh in Portuguese since forever as well
Ñ is dirty
* Y, K and W are only used in recently-imported foreign words, so you wouldn't have them in the 16th or 17th century
* Gi might be related to the way some Chinese languages use the Zh (it would sound like our Gi, I guess, since our Z is like in English
* Ph was used until 1910 in a lot of Latin-origined words, but F was also present in latin, so we always had both
I think he might just have picked one
It's even closer, spanish use ñ and we use nh
We also have ch like she english sh, and lh like
idk
The c and the s can also be confused like in sinto and cinto
Well, H is silent unless in a digaph (ch, nh, lh)
Maybe he added the h after the g so you don't read it like "**ge**t" instead "**je**t". In Portuguese we need a mute U between a G and an E/I to get the hard G instead of the soft one, but maybe he didn't want you guys to mistakenly read the U, but I'm just trying to guess, now
So it's more like tch
And now all of a sudden i got interested in a language i had never paid much attention to
Damn, vietnamese around that i know are like
And not like Portugal is your dream destination when you want to work abroad
"Sending a fax" in Portuguese
\[PORTUGAL\] Just the word "João" it's a name, but for some reason no foreigner can pronounce it right
Esternocleidomastoideu in Portugal is kind of a meme because of an old movie
ñ is "nh" here
I've always found that "uit" just sounds like "out" in an Irish accent
In Portuguese we say
Mano out Puto (I think it goes the same as Bro for English)
Portuguese:
For a group of people - Boas Pessoal (Boh
ush P'soo
ahl) which means good morning/afternoon/night people
Boas can be said at any time of the day
For a single person - Boas mano (Boh
ush Mah
noo) which means good (whatever time it is) brother
These are just the ones that I use
But there are many other ways of saying it
Wow we have also picha in Portuguese
Never knew
Ayyy tío
Yeah I'd say those are the most common (Mano being "Bro" and Puto being the masculine of "Kid")
In the Algarve we say Moço/Moçe (which means "Boy"), though it depends on where you live and your social group
It's also used for emphasis or as an exclamation
Where I studied in the Alentejo some guys would say Primo ("Cousin") which I love
And I think they say, or used to say, Chavalo in Lisbon
The worst term imo is Tropa ("Army" or "Troop"), because people use it as a singular word despite it being a plural one
Mostly used by people who try to be thugs
I also hear "filho" sometimes
"Compicha" is very funny because it means "my friend who also has a dick".
I'm from Lisbon and never heard someone saying Chavalo but that's hilarious and yea the Tropa term is normally for the ones that think they are the best and lets be honest 99% sure they consume drugs
Ei: rabeta, paneleiro, meu, filho, moço, cabrão, jovem, menino
depende do gajo e do nível de afinidade
I can't take people who say Tropa seriously
They just sound so tryhard
Stick to Mano or Puto
No meu grupo de amigos cá da terra também dizemos "Zé" e "Cara de cu".
Zé aqui é só para quem de chama José, nunca dizemos fora disso
So, I am from the south of Portugal (Algarve), and we have lots of almond trees
Legend goes that a moorish king married a blond northern princess, from a country with lots of snow in the winter (so, clearly not from around here)
They loved each other very much, but she was increasingly sad, year after year
He finally asked her what was wrong, and she said that she missed the snow from her home country
So, he had thousands and thousand of almond trees planted
They blossom in winter, and the flowers are white
So one day, she came to her palace window, and saw all the fields filled "with snow".
It's a lovely love story
Not a legend but a true story, embellished by some myths added a few years later:
The story of Peter the first and Inês de Castro
The whole story is quite long but as a TLDR let's just say that it involves a perceived loss of power by the crown of Portugal because of a romance between the heir and a Galician dame that ended up with her being killed on the orders of the King,  her killers slain in the goriest way and the corpse of the Peter's mistress exhumed,  sat on the throne and crowned as Queen of Portugal
Full story:
I have one
I don't rly know if it could be considered a legend or not, or if it even rly did happen, but it's usually a way to make fun of the British
Ok, so the story goes like this:
In the 18th, 19th century, the British, ever so imperialistic and looking for land, wanted to own part of the Azores islands (I'm trusting you know where those are)
The Azores are a volcanic archipelago and, since they're so close to the mid-oceanic rift, it's common for new land to appear out of the sea, usually made out of _pedra-pomes_ (pumice)
As you may know, pumice flouts, from its lack of density and, since the heavy rock and minerals inside those newly formed rocks were still very hot, still being magma, a small "island" would surface
That would be for some hours/days, until the magma inside would solidify and the island would go back to the ocean's bottom
Well, there was a British ship, which was tasked with either purchasing some land from the islanders, to build a military facility there, something they never accomplished to, or discovering some new land, for the empire
One day, there was an underwater eruption and there came a little new pumice island
The islanders, having been living there for generations, knew not to go there
There was no reason to, after all: nothing lived there, the soil was barren and hot and there was nothing for either the cows to eat (there are lots of cows in the Azores, it's like sheep in Wales) nor place for plants to grow, thus, no one really cared about the small new island
No one but the British crew, who immediately after hearing about the new land, sailed to claim it for the great British Empire, the empire where the sun never sets
Well, mission accomplished, they thought
They had discovered a new land, right in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, right for the taking
Now they just had to go back to England and the King would make them heroes, they thought, heroes
And so they did
They left the Azores and sailed back to Britain having only left a Union Jack on the island, reminding everyone of the everlasting power of the British
But, you know, sea travel was quite slow, in those days
It took them almost a year to come back with a bigger expedition to start a colony
They took so long indeed that the island had gone back to where it came from, to the bottom of the ocean
With it, the proud British flag
It's said that the flag is still there, at the bottom, and that the British are so powerful (or, at least, were) that they own the seabed
They just can't get to it
The message here is, obviously to teach children not to be greedy
I don't have anything against British people btw, I'm not even from the Azores
Just that you kinda left (and still do, ngl) a bad impression wherever you went :)
Do you also have stories about the "enchanted/bewitched moorish girls"? (don't know how to translate this, to be honest)
Apparently, Algarve is filled with "mouras encantadas", that will give you treasures if you break their curse/enchantment
It's amazing
In the Algarve every town has it's "moura encantada" story
The one from my town (Silves) goes something like this:
During the conquest of Silves, the christians layed a siege to the city
Legend has it that a moorish princess, daughter of the ruler of the city, fell in love with one prince from the attacking side
They frequently exchanged letters
Her father didn't like it, so he forbid it, but they would still secretly exchange letters
One day, he convinced her to open the doors of the city at night so he could enter and kiss her
She agreed
On a night of full moon, she secretly went to the walls and opened the doors
But she didn't find the prince alone
All his army was there
She had just opened the doors for the enemy to enter
She run as fast as she could, hiding herself on the castle's water tank
Extremely sad, she cried herself until she died
Legend has it that if you go to the castle on a night of full moon, you can still hear her cries coming from the water tank, while her ghost patrols the walls, so that no one will ever again invade the city
Apart from the new year's eve, we celebrate the anniversary of the Carnation Revolution with fireworks and party
The Carnation Revolution happened in the 25th of April of 1974, and put an end to the fascist regime
If we have the chance, we'll just light one up for fun
and Saint John's!
There's fireworks from Luís I bridge to the Douro river
The duke of Wellington was leading the troops in Portugal while the king was in Brazil
After beating the french general Massena on the third french invasion, the duke ate the steak that was being made to the french general in case he won
After pretty much everyone told him that going to war in North Africa was a bad idea, King D. Sebastião of Portugal, who had no children, decided to go to war anyway (Battle of Alcácer-Quibir), and be the one to lead the troops
He died
There was no heir
Portugal ended up losing its independence to Spain for 60 years, which heavily accelarated the decline of its already declining Empire
Also involving North Africa, que conquest of the city of Ceuta - which was a huge disappointment
In 1415, it was a very important city where a lot of commercial trades took place, and the Portuguese wanted to gain control of said trades (mostly oriental products like spices and gold)
They sent a huge army and quickly succeeded in seizing the city
However, it was a big flop
The moors just changed the trade routes to other nearby cities, meaning there was no profit being made, whilst simultaneously attacking the city in hopes of taking it back, which meant a lot of expenses in fighting them off
That Salazar (Portuguese dictator) died because he fell off a chair
Was that the one where the builders were using two different methods of measurements and weights
That happened a few years ago with a drone of the portuguese navy
And then we repeated it in Tangier and a few dozen settlements in the coast of modern-day Morocco
he fell of a chair, which debilitated him massively and led him to be taken out of power, but he died two years after the fall
the hilarious things is no one told him he was no longer in charge and for the rest of his life people around him pretended he was still dictator
Sweden is definitely on my bucket list so I will make a note of it
Ship is definitely beautiful
It was the Mars climate orbiter, Lockheed Martin used feet and inches instead of the metric system to measure acceleration
At least you can vote for local and european elections (if you register)
This one is kind of a weird one because this is somewhat unknown even among Portuguese people and the theme is also weird, but here it goes
Unfortunately, during our history as a planet, we've had to deal with slavery
Also unfortunately, slavery has always had a big racial connotation, as in "it's fine for black people to be enslaved because they're not real people, they're inferior, they're animals".
Well, queue in "Padre António Vieira".
This was a Portuguese priest who actively preached that slavery is fine, but black people are just regular people, so they are not to inherently be inferior and enslaved
This man went out of his way to fight racial injustices *only*. He believed that racism was very bad, but slavery was fine, as long as it didn't have to do with race
Black people were just regular people, so they shouldn't inherently be slaves because of the color of their skin
In fact, they should be allowed to own slaves as well, white slaves if they wanted to (since if all races are the same, white slaves would exist as well)
When the BLM movement reemerged this year and statues all over America and the rest of the world started being vandalized and/or destroyed, a statue of him was also vandalized here in Lisbon since he "wasn't against slavery".
I found that to be a very interesting grey area because yes, slavery is bad and he didn't oppose it, but this dude was FOR race equality, he wanted white people to be considered as possible slaves and black people to own slaves too
He had problems with the race thing, not the practice, so technically, vandalizing his statues makes no sense in the context of the protest
He's a very well known figure in Portugal, to the point where his texts are widely studied in school due to the complex Portuguese usage
However, most people don't know about this quirk about him, which I always found to be one of the most interesting things about him
Some tea related trivia
Portugal is one of the few places in Europe where tea is produced, and the only one when it comes to green tea
Said tea is produced in the Azores islands
Tea was introduced to Europe in the 16th by the Portuguese after they made contact with the Japanese
Catherine of Braganza popularised the drinking of tea among the nobility in Britain when she married king Charles II
We have the record for longest table setting in Europe
So on the 22nd of March 1998, to celebrate the newly built Vasco da Gama bridge (which still is the longest bridge in Europe), a team made a 5 Km table on the bridge and served lunch for more than 16,000 people
Around ten tonnes of *Feijoada* (pork and beans, a common Portuguese meal) were served
As far as I know, this used to be the world record but it was beaten by some Indians or Egyptians, can't quite tell based on what Google says
[News article (BBC)]
[About the bridge]
One of our dictators died because he fell of a chair
Let me add most of our contributions to Mathematics and Geography
For example, the Portuguese mathematician [Pedro Nunes] discoveries contributed to establishing plane and ship routes
Also, the [Mercator Projection] was supposedly stolen from the Portuguese court
The Portuguese had an habit of keeping their discoveries a secret, so when they were found, the finder got to keep all the credit
This is in line with the discovery of America before Columbus and so on
There's more stuff
One more example is the knowledge we helped preserve from the golden age of Islam
Also a small coffee production in the island of S. Jorge
Which I believe it is the only place in Europe where coffee is produced
We also were part of the armada unfortunately
People never talk about it
Basically kick-started our demise as the strongest naval empire in Asia and we fought the Dutch for decades and lost most of our foothold in SE Asia
I don't care what temperature it is, it's always a perfect time for ice-cream
I believe tea became more popular among the general populace when India became a British colony, as it was then that tea became more affordable for the average person
Before that it was more of a luxury item
Actually didn't know about that
Some Portuguese are convinced that has we not lost of Asian colonies we would be rich today, ignoring that the reason for the Dutch to be rich lays more with the industrial revolution
Nationalistic morons
True, your revolt also helped our restoration movement as the Spanish couldn't fight on 2 fronts at full strength
Guess just not having a fascist or communist dictatorship in the period of biggest economic expansion in the western world was key
Everyone here thinks that 1
99€=2
00€, so that strategy is just useless
Take my ~~money~~ €1
95 and shut up
I'm here representing Portugal and we wanted out
I was never in the scouts, so I will say what I kbow:
-There are no Boy scouts or Girl Scouts, its mixed
-The Scouts are part of the Catholic church, so you need to go to church and sunday school, and do all that catholic stuf, There is also secular scouts but its a much smaller organization
-They do all the normal scout thing, camping, learning to tie knots, learning to make shelters, pray to our lord Jesus Christ, all that normal stuff
-They have weird clothes
-There are big reunions with all the scouts from Portugal (organized by the Curch)
There is more stuff by I don't remember anything more
Portuguese scout checking in
We have them mixed and separate scouts organisations
CNE - The catholic ones (mixed), AEP - The non catholic ones (mixed) and the AGP - Girl scouts group
As far as I know the AEP are usually more "militarized" then the CNE but it depends of how each group even inside the CNE organisation decides how to do their scouting
We definitely use weird clothes, you may check them [here] and find out more about the CNE, non scouts make fun of our "Jarreteiras" the dingling colored thing that we use on our high socks, I think they look really dorky tbh
Being part of the Catholic association we do learn about our boy Jesus but some groups take it more serious than others
Older leaders are way more religious than the younger ones
As one of the younger leader I don't even believe in that, but I feel like  the spirituality may add some good values and mystique to scouting
There's a problem atm, many of the leaders are like like 35+, as younger scouts leave the movement or simply don't find the time to do it
It takes quite some time and effort to organize and plan all our activities making it exhausting sometimes, to the point of discouraging some members to stay
Apart from the catholic values we learn survival techniques, how to make fires, build a kitchen area, how to read and guide a military map, usually by games and workshops
I've done one of those activities where the kids go through a scary path, or we make like a game or a prank that they do not know about, we call it "Batismo de Campo" - Camp Baptism, to make the new kids welcomed to the group, ya know
Fun fact: There's a Portuguese Scouts group in Genève, as there are many Portuguese living there
I was a scout to (portuguese) and in 2014 we went to the  Kendersteg international camp in Switzerland and let me tell you, your country (in that region at least) has some of the most breathtaking and beautiful scenery I've ever seen
Like, unbelievable stuff really
We also align more with the swiss scouts rather than the americans, but in my group since most of the leaders were actually ex-military, we learned a lot of that too but we learned those technical military things in a very free way, there was nothing like an uptight atmosphere
I think we learnt good values like "desemerdanço", patriotism, volunteering and all that in a very healthy way, and the tasks we were given were always so much fun, we would gladly do them but there wouldn't be an obligation (it needn't be)
Also, most of what we did in camps was "raids", which means covering a long track in the wild for many hours, on foot, to get from a town to another (I'm talking towns with 20 people in them, at best), and always unattended during the way
I loved it there
Religious scouts in Portugal are divided in 4 group, depending on their age: lobitos (6-10yo), exploradores (10-14yo), pioneiros (14-18yo) and caminheiros (18-22yo)
After 22 you can sign up for a course that allows you to become a leader (Chefe) - I'm not really familiar with what is taught in this course by I think it includes things like pedagogy, so that the activities that the Chefes plan for the young scouts are age appropriate to their development as a child or teen
This allows for the activities to be fun and at the same time useful to develop social skill and team work, much like playing team sports
I've heard that being a scout ou at least having been a member for a period of time is valued when applying for a job for exactly that reason
It also teaches responsibility: as the kids grow older, they start to be responsible for organising a part of their activities, make the constructions when camping, cleaning and helping the younger ones when needed, though the Chefes are always present for whatever might be necessary
I was a member of the scouts for some years
I loved it and would recommend it anytime
Didn't feel it was too strict and the only similary to the military might be the clothes and boots and being "in formation" (not sure what it is called in English) when is time to give instructions or when in a ceremony, but that's probably because the scouts was created by a military man, some of those things stuck
I think besides the religious scouts (CNE, which includes the marine scouts) and the non-religious scouts (AEP), there's an organisation of girls scouts called "Guias" but I'm not familiar with that group
There is also maritime scouts I think but I don't know much about them
Some were found buried in the last century near my hometown
There's still preserved mosaics and paint, as well as other day-to-day items such as coins and farming material
I think the main building of the ruins was a public bath
In case you are curious, it's the ruins of Conímbriga
Yes allot aqueduct, irrigation systems (Hispania was the bread basket of the Roman Republic), Many roads, do not forget that most were built with local labor, they had the system to control all the salt mines (including gold mines the Douro river in oporto Literally translates golden river)
The salary comes from salt, which was paid for the work
When the Roman empire ended and the rest of Europe was in the dark ages
We were occupied by the Arabs (independent Arab nation) the entire infrastructure was revitalized So there is still a lot to be found
The village where my parents live still has a road and is small place
Yes, in Portugal we have some, for example [The ancient roman temple in Évora]
Yes do have a temple ruin on the city of Évora, in Portugal we also do have an entire city of Conimbriga (now named Coimbra) in ruins
They're pretty interesting and worth visiting landmarks
Many modern cities date back to the Roman times, Lisbon (Olissipo), Coimbra (Conimbriga), Braga (Bracara Augusta), etc
Plus, I think the most famous Roman ruins in Portugal is the temple of Diana in Évora
This one isn't ruins, but there's a story about the Portuguese river Lima where the Romans believed it was a mythical river which made anyone who passed it lose their memories, so a legion passing there was anxious to cross the river
The story says the General/Centurion/whatever had to cross the river alone and then called the soldiers name by name to prove he didn't get his mind wiped
Because of this story they have this (cardboard
I don't actually know what they're made of) legion in one side of the river and a general in the other side to honour the story I guess (Obviously we put it there, not the romans), it's next to the famous Ponte de Lima, the oldest town in Portugal, as in oficially being called a town, in 1125
Yep, and the bridges are still used to this day, one is right in my small village, only thing is that it is tarmacked
But it is still pretty well kept and bellow it can get a nice view, you can see some stuff that shows over time people have not tried to keep it untouched tho
There are tons of roman and pre-roman ruins here
Where I'm currently living in, when there is construction work on the historical center, there's always something that's uncovered
Currently they're trying to dig up the old roman forum
We also have a temple in Évora
[Quim Barreiros - Bacalhau à Portuguesa]
Any Quim Barreiros song is a guilty pleasure and a lot of us enjoy in Portugal
Well, now I know no one will take me serious but I love how genuine the Portuguese singer Marante is
He's some sort of "whorehouse poet", with his lyrics almost always covering issues related to husbands who neglect their wives while complaining they don't understand them
A lot is lost in translation but this is his anthem (Tough the original is not his but Brazilian):
The nightclub
Keeps up at night
a party mood
From afar you can hear
Various instruments
strings and metals
Bohemians drink
Singing and dancing
To the sound of the orchestra
A shrill sound
Who gave it the name
Crystal Sound
It's a nightclub
Spoken nightclub
Place of bad reputation
With the doors open
During the night
Enter whoever you want
But that night
Without me expecting
A lady came in
I was amazed
Because it was
my wife
She got tired
of sleeping alone
Waiting for me
And that night
Resolved to end
her long
And damned wait
She didn't want anymore
to lead the life
of an honored woman
If actually
It didn't help
to be a righteous woman
As she was
She chose
To abandon
The role of wife
to live
Among the butterflies
That make point
In that place
My life
Much more wandering
Now continues
I transformed my wife
In a street woman
In the youngest lady
of Crystal Sound
*repeat*
Another himn of his, now on a happier note:
A bela portuguesa ( The beautiful portuguese woman):
As a disclaimer, I love this guy because he his as kitch as anyone can be
Usually I listen to 80's new wave and metal eheheh
It was quite a success  over here at the time
É o prato preferido do povo de Portugal
> I don't know think you can get a more portuguese song than Quim Barreiros
Which is ironic, as most of his songs are covers of Brazilian songs
That our food is just excellent
From soup to desserts, we have it all
And, if you don't overeat,  it's also healthy
That Portugal is an actual country and not part of Spain ;)
That we are all poor and that our salaries should be higher
If you are Ukrainian, you surely work on construction
A large portion of us hates the Teachers Trade Union representative (FENPROF) Mário Nogueira
I watched the premiere on TV and didn't really like it, but last year I binged the show (not hard to do considering the amount of episodes) and loved it
It really is hilarious and I've been recommending it to other people (though you'd be surprised that I actually have to explain the Troubles to a lot of them)
I'm Portuguese and I hate Spanish food
Spanish food is so similar to ours
Do you hate Portuguese food as well
I agree on the superior bread
I literally ate pizza accompanied by some bread in Paris, because it was so damn good
Hard disagree on cheese and wine, sorry
I'm not talking about their national gastronomy, but when I ate at spanish restaurants or hotels, the food was just horrible
Are you suggesting that whatever the cheese, there is a similar, but better French cheese
To me that situation happened in reverse, i barely have any accent when speaking English, so it kinda sounds "normal" and a few tourists though i was English when I'm Portuguese
What gave it away
Not the person you're replying to, and I can't spot the exact signs of Spanish, but there's a lot of phrasings there that even a Portuguese person would write as well
Omitting the pronoun ("Lived" instead of "I lived"), the "has to be" (that's a direct translation of "tem de ser") and writing nationalities with a lower case initial, for instance
"Paid by card" also feels like a very literal translation, but I'm not so sure on that
An English native will obviously have a keener eye and spot more than this, but those three signs alone are a dead giveaway of someone who speaks a Romance language natively
I would imagine its probably not even legal in most of EU for a company to just leave packages outside / doorstep
Here, if it's the national mail they either deliver directly to you if you are home or leave a notice saying your parcel will be available at the post office for pick up from next day  when you are not home
Some other companies either call you or arrange with you a pick up spot
Leaving it on the porch just sounds absolutely mental lol
Nope, usually, if they can't reach you they'll take the package back and you can reschedule the delivery with most distributors
CTT Expresso (National mail service) however, most of the time, in my experience, they don't even ring your doorbell they take the package to the area's CTT store and leave a note in your mailbox for you to go and pick it up, which is super annoying but yeah
They will never leave it unattended
They either ring the bell and give it to you, or leave a paper that you can use to pick up your parcel at the closest post office/ whatever pick up place they have set up
Not a problem at all
That's when they even remember to ring your doorbell, god I hate CTT with a passion
The concept of milk is foreign to you
Never been to the UK but some Square headed bloke told me  I should probably say somewhere in Luton
Pilha = battery / Pila = dick
Coina = a town in Portugal / Cona = pussy
Carvalho = oak tree / Caralho = dick or fuck (depending on the context)
Sabão = soap / Cagão = someone that shits a lot
Cágado = a type of turtle / Cagado = shitted
Bolhão = a neigbourhood in Porto / Colhão = testicle
Sexto = sixth / Sexo = sex
Carvalho = oak tree
Caralho = rude word for penis (actually it is a nautical term meaning crow's nest, but in the past it became a synonyms for penis)
In portuguese
Carvalho = oak tree
Caralho = cock
For portuguese, I'd give the example of côco vs cocó. The first one means coconut, the second means poop
Here Ânus (Anus) and Anos (Years) are pronounced exactly the same way
It's the classic kids' favourite joke
"Quantos ânus tens
" (How old are you
"How many years/anuses do you have")
"Oito" (eight)
"hAHa, tENs OiTo rAbOs" ("haha you have eight butts
In Portuguese it's papá for dad (more like daddy), Papa for pope, and papa (no capital P) for mushy food/baby food
Portugal must be one of the most expensive countries to study in uni in the EU
For portuguese students public universities go around 800€ per year + dorms or outside accommodation
For international students it goes to like 3000 a year minimum depending on the university and what you are studying
We have scholarships for portuguese students that can cover most of the price of the tuition but it is never free
I understand that it's more expensive than our 800€ but let's remember that portuguese minimum wage is 635€ and a lot of families have to survive with only that
Here you don't get student loans
they are not really a thing
If you don't have money you just don't go to uni or work while studying which is really hard
Accommodation is like 250€ in the smaller cities and 400€ more or less in Lisbon and Porto + transport which is expensive as hell
So people really need a lot of money
Talking from experience I study 1h30 from my home town so I have a place near my university
I spend roughly 500€ per month
With the minimum wage being 630€ I could never study what I want were I want if my parents didn't help with the money
It is really sad here to see people that want to study and don't have the means to do it ://
Coffee
The common expresso goes for 60 cents in your average neighborhood cafe
Also, fruit
I don't know if it's the cheapest in europe but it is definitely the cheapest in western europe
Everytime I buy fruit outside Portugal I feel like I am burning money
Wine and cork
coffee, coffee is definitely cheaper being 0
60 cents, wine idk but i was told it was cheaper in comparison to some places in Europe (I'm not sure, pls correct me other wise)
Idk maybe pastries goods in coffee shops that you eat with your coffee or tea but i don't know so correct if I'm wrong
On side note does McDonald's change prince's in Europe
I am going to say wine and coffee
If you go to automatic machines an expresso can be as low as .20-.40€
Yeah well
sorry about that
How
I get 5GB for 13€ in Germany
I pay 8Gb For 15
Three
I didn't mean the cheapest places, I meant the average in an urban area
In the cheap places coffee is under 50 cents
The common combo of coffee plus pastel de nata (sweet custard tart) is usually 0
8-1€.
I don't even have a contract
I use aldi talk and am free to change my packet whenever I want
With a contract you can get a lot more
I have never had problems with coverage
But I guess that depends on where you live
Meh they don't bother me, i like them when I'm studying or writing something
Guess If was walking in the rain and one got near me i would be not very pleased with it
XP but yh you could say i like them i guess
Arca Frigorífica (Freezer) = Freezing Ark
Fogão (Stove) = Big Fire
Beija-Flor (Hummingbird) = Flower Kisser
Cove-Flor (Cauliflower) = Flower Cabbage
Planta Trepadeira (Creeping Vine) = Climber Plant
Encarnado (Red) = Meat-like
(Red can also be Vermelho, which comes from the word Verme, meaning Verm)
Aparelho Dentário (Braces) = Dental Apparatus

Prego=> Steak with bread, not funny but it isn't just a beef with bread
Prego, one of many portuguese gastronomy inventions, one of my favorites of course
Eat it with Bolo do Caco, another excellent gastronomy masterpiece made by love and with love
Eating it only with that and some beef you bought at a supermarket close from home is not what it is meant to be and what it deserves to be
But here i'm gonna talk about the Prego I have seen in my region
The Prego I also prepare with joy most of the time
First beggining with the soft and crunchy Bolo do Caco and some "manteiga de alho" thinking is the original and perfect mix between the soft and the spicy, adds quite a lot to the food i'm reffering off
Well, now that we are talking about the ingredients, it isn't polite to leave the others behind the curtains, right
We then go down one level of the Prego, and we find the lettuce, maybe it is from your own garden or your own supplier, even your supermarket up close that sells it fresh and delicious
Prepared with salt, vinagger and oil like a salad, adds the healthy part to the meal, and a wonderfull one
After revieweing the lettuce we go find the next ingredient
A circled flavorful piece of  magnificient that turns it into a even more magnificient
Red and juicy with the typical seed in the middle, the tomato, making it a very beautifull and delicious set with the next ingredient
The beef, in my personal and not that much experient opinion, the most important part of the Prego
Mostly coming from a delicious and gorgeus cow, that has been living and eating in this terrific volcanic region
The beef itself it's, again, juicy and when tempered and cooked, it adds a excellent sensation in my mouth that everytime I eat, I never forget about it until I eat it again, just full of joy and excitement gets in my mind
You would be wondering what's next
For your insatiable curiosity, in this part comes the egg
From a supermarket or not, It is of great quality and that it comes
And where it comes it does a great chicken broth
Middly cooked and at a perfect temperature, middly hot and with the egg yolk still intact
And for the end, the optional ingredients
This is the part where every human that prepares this meal gets that creativity out of the head of the people and they start painting art in the food
Like some any people agree, food is an art and it is true
Pisca-pisca (turn signal lights) = blink blink

I think it's Gaelic (Irish)
Biggest dangers lie in the Sea
Probability the most dangerous, because it's the most likely, it's [the Portuguese Man O'War] or as we call it, "Caravela".
Probably wolves, but we have so few that they shouldn't even count
Wasps and ticks maybe
Edit: Portugal
How do I get a flair
Wolves of the Iberian kind and boars are dangerous but, you don't find many
There's a couple of species of venomous vipers but they aren't that common either
The dangerous animals that you can find everywhere are bugs, venomous spiders, small scorpions, centipedes and stupid mosquitos
Actually not
The most dangerous is the [Portuguese man o'war
] also known as "floating terror".
You need to go to r/askeurope and you have the option in the top right
Edit: typo
Well, they're not \*that\* few, there's about 300 or so
There's no attacks on humans on record, though
I'd say that, when considering mammals, wild boars are much more of a risk to people
And yes, ticks
Try to tell that to my brain
Cool, thanks :)
Was it the singing Bush from the Three Amigos
So, in Portugal we have a President and a Prime Minister
The president gets elected by the people, and the prime minister gets appointed by the president after he is elected by the Parliament
The prime minister runs the cabinet, and basically rules the country, while the president signs every bill into law (I think he can prevent bills from becoming laws twice, before they become laws with or without the president's support), and he can also fire the prime minister and/or dissolve parliament
The president only steps in when there is a severe crisis
In theory there is three powers that should be divided   and independent
Legislation, executive and judicial
In my country (Portugal) there's a parlament elected by people that has the legislative power
That parlament elects the government with a PM as a leader that holds the executive power
The judicial power his hold by judges (although the principal group of judges is nomited by parliament)
So if in theory all the powers should be independent they all came from one single election and if in theory we vote for a deputy from my zone we all aware that we are giving the power to the PM
So as a figure of control there's the President
He's elected by direct election and controls all the military force , etc
Normally the president is a person with a background in politics and with a greater consensus between all the parties
His role it's more to guarantee the constitution
he can say that he oppose to some governamental decision but he has to justify  that with the constitution and not has his opinion (that usually occurs 2-3 times in 4 years)
So his role could be most of the time just has a figure of consensus but when he has to make a decision it must be something important
I swear americans are just born half brain dead
Edit:
Portugal is basically a  parliamentary republic
It's true for Portugal that the President "appoints" the PM
but he basically just accepts and tells the candidate appointed by the wining party of the legislative elections to form a government
All the rest is like a parliamentary republic
Portugal it's a Parliamentary Republic
We elect President and parliament independently
PM and the government is suggested by the parliament to the President
A PM without parliament support does not  resist more than 15 days (it happened only once) so the oppion/decision of the President it's irrelevant to choose the PM
Dont know about the rest but Portugal doesn't really work like that
I didn't know that, but I also don't intend to have an EU flag
I don't even have a Portuguese one
Not at all
I don't even think most people here know there's an Europe Day
Same in Portugal
We don't even fly the Portuguese flag, let alone the EU one
They're only flown for football reasons
Shops don't put Portuguese flags in proheminent places at any time of the year because they know people aren't interested
The only exception was during Euro 2004, in Portugal
Back then, a lot of people (not me) put up Portuguese flags
I guess that's how you get Portuguese people to be patriotic, a combination of foreigners being here and football
"A gaiola dourada" (the golden cage TLdr it's about the a stereotypical portuguesa family that lives in France, it's wholesome, culturally funny, and portraits really well in general the Portuguese family dinamic not just the ones Portuguese immigrants
It was a bit of drama that I'm not going to spoil
It's a really good movie) or you could see "Variações" (TLdr it's about one of the most iconic Portugues rock star, António Variações, he was singer and song writer that came from nothing that became an icon for Portuguese rock even after his death he is beloved, we was basically a Portuguese version of Freddie Mercury literally but i don't mean has in copy but in terms of similarities lots of talent, gay, flamboyant/unic style of dressing, etc
The movie is really good)
"Sangue do Meu Sangue", by João Canijo is my Portuguese recommendation
Les Intouchables
He's not incompetent, in fact he's very competent he's just unwilling to work
Poland
I always wanted to see the Kremlin
Raid Tancos base
NATO Headquarters
Tancos
The Portuguese delegation are in, we’re pretty good at it
That’s how we got our independence back
Merkel
She's the only head of government that has a scientific background, and it shows
Despite her not being our actual head of government, she's Europe's mom and I actually worry a bit about what will be of us when she retires
Absolutely anyone who wouldn't treat the national treasury as an infinite funding for friends, family and economical groups with ties to the rulling party
We could make it if our governments saw the people as more than cash cows to be milked into oblivion to subsidise the " apparatus ".
I recall with a deep sense of nostalgia a prime minister we had that praised some nordic minister that resigned because she FORGOT to pay a 50 euro licence for a pier on a property she owned
That said prime minister said we needed politicians lie her in Portugal
That said prime minister was head of the most corrupt government we had in 45 years ( and we had a lot of corrupt ones), was charged, accusations droped and is enjoying his retirement in peace, as it always happens here
I dream of having then sort of corruption the UK has
That we can change the meaning of an adjective depending where we put it in a sentence
Say big (grande): if we put it behind the noun, it has a physical meaning, so "uma mulher grande" (a woman big), means the woman is big in size
If we put in front of the noun, then it takes on a psychological/moral meaning: "uma grande mulher" (a big woman), means a heroic, morally strong, important woman
Understanding nothing of Irish, I like that you guys don't have the words for "yes" or "no" for directly answering questions, and just agree/disagree by repeating the verb in the question
Portuguese, despite having "sim" as a valid answer, we rarely use it, and use the verb in the question as agreement (and is the only (western
) Latin language to do so as a default, iirc)
"Não" is more common, but only because it is used to negate the verb in the question anyway
"Passas muito tempo no reddit, não passas
" - "Passo
" : "*You spend a lot of time on reddit, don't you
" - "[I] spend
I agree
I also like that by adding negations we just compound the problem and meaning
Like the "feliz", "infeliz", "desinfeliz" setup, where you go from happy, to unhappy and then someone tragically or pathetically unhappy
We use h but it makes sound in conjunction with n, c or l .
Naked snail ahaha
Desinfeliz is not a word, is it
Arroz de cabidela, which is rice with the blood of the chicken
I've seen some negative reactions from foreigners concerning [*sopa de cavalo cansado*] (tired horse soup)
It consists of bread (usually corn bread), red wine, egg yolk, sugar and sometimes cinnamon as well
I'm not a big fan of it either to be honest
Also [Haggis] gets a bad rep, but it's delicious
It contains sheep's pluck (heart, liver, and lungs), minced with onion, oatmeal, suet, spices, and salt, mixed with stock, and cooked while traditionally encased in the animal's stomach, though now often in artificial casing instead (thanks wikipedia
I've heard that there are vegetarian variants of Haggis and that they're actually quite delicious
Need to try that at some point
Maybe dobrada .. it’s the stomach’s cow with beans
Even I don’t like it
It’s so gross
Caracóis (snails) it's similar to what the French have and eat, i suppose many other cultures don't have this habit of eating them ( well papered, of course, with cold beer) and might think its disgusting or gross
I personally haven't eaten them because it grosses me out a bit, although from what I've seen and been told a lot of people like it and say they taste really good
Pig blood sausage, chicken blood rice (so good
), pig blood soup covered with a layer of pepper, cow hoof soup, mutton brains with scrambled eggs
Well, in Portugal we have snails, “cows hand” with chickpeas, “arroz à cabidela” which is rice with chicken and chickens blood, cows stomach with beans
delicious
So damn good !!!
Ia mencionar isso
Pessoalmente, detesto
Também existe rechina ou moleja (rechina no Alto Alentejo e moleja no Baixo Alentejo)
Não sei se conhecem mas é uma sopa com miudezas de porco e sangue do mesmo
Também detesto
Aliás, todas as comidas com sangue são horríveis pra mim
Nah you've got great pies
May not be the fanciest food, but it's delicious nonetheless
I love snails, it is so good
Nunca pensei que a chô tôra Isabel dos Santos comesse arroz de cabidela
Miudezas com sangue
Mas não, nunca ouvi de tais pratos
>else you get those
Never aet snails, but people here either buy the ones served at small restaurants or tarven already pre made which from what i have been told are really good, or buy them in variety of stores be it a small store to the big ones
You probably got bad luck i guess
Omg agora percebi que este nickname é péssimo ahahah
Alentejanices
Hehehe
Não tens de quê! Mas já tem te acontecido alguma situação caricata ou algo
Se bem que eu gosto de morcela e leva sangue, aqui na minha zona a tradicional é a morcela de arroz (que é de longe a minha favorita)
Por acaso não ahah até porque o meu primeiro nome não é Isabel
Nunca provei
Nós sabemos, Risabel
That’s my true name
Very common
But we pronounce it as "ókay". Some people also pronounce it as "ókapa" (k in Portuguse is kapa)
Depends on the mood
Yes, it's pretty common, but we don't use it so much as an adjective, like in your first example
We use it more like in your second example though, and we use it a lot as a response to requests and stuff like that, as in "Don't forget to lock the door on your way out" "OK".
We usually pronounce the O in Portuguese and the K in English though
Though pronouncing the K in Portuguese is also done as a bit of a tongue in cheek thing
Very, even old people use it, it's just a normal word now, people don't see it as an english thing, I didn't even know it wasn't an original word in my language until very late
I've used it all my life, it's so common I didn't even know it was an English word when I was a kid
Even my grandma says OK
Nope "kkkkkkk" is Brazilian thing
We say "hahahaha ha" here instead
In Portuguese, "fim de semana" is Saturday and Sunday
A fellow countryman time-travels from 1919 to 2019 and asks you what happened to your country
What would you tell him
The Republic actually works now, trust me
Let's just forget the 50 years of dictatorship in between
Me: Bad economic policies and institutional corruption leads young men to emigrate
Him: Wtf the machine didn't work damnit
"Don't worry, we aren't fighting in the next one
Me: Don't worry, we're not going to participate in the second World War
We starved because the government sold our food, but at least we didn't fight in it
Brazilians are coming back though
BTW, Olivença is still Spanish ;)
OH and about the colonies
No more
But we try to be friends
To be fair, the Treaty of Versailles probably didn't help
\*Raises glass\*
Join the club, mate
Franco
Stalin
Hitler
You'll need to be more specific
Olá! :)
It has already started by you accepting Olivença instead Olivenza, now we will change the river course that defines the border slowly
At least that's what the 2119 timetraveler told me
Malta has a very rich history
The first time I was exposed to it was in the campaign of Age of Empires III
Sadly I don't know of many other stories that take place there
I wouldn't have known that the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was a thing if not for the internet
I wouldn't say it's overlooked, as there are better examples on this thread
People are very aware of Portugal, I think
But it is certainly underrated
We have this fame of being a small country or just being lumped together with Spain
But you know what, there's a nice moral to the story
It's like that poem "Ozymandias" by Percy Shelley
Such a big Empire, its influence lasted longer than the Soviet Union or the USA, and yet, no one remembers
No heroes, no villains, no achievements
No movies, no widespread media attention
Hitler and other megalomaniacs wanted a 1000 years "Empire". Well, look at Portugal
This is what 1000 years looks like
Kinda luckwarm
Is portuguese history overlooked
I mean the Crusades, the age of discovery, the slave trade
The language was definitely a surprise to me
I made friends with a Maltese girl during my master's and hearing her speak the language for the first time was fascinating, as it sounded so much like Arabic
And she was super fluent in English and Italian, and probably the first non-Portuguese person that pronounced my surname correctly on the first try
All the different traditions she spoke of also sounded fascinating, and it really made me want to visit the country (hopefully I can some day in the future)
I mean, if I tried to occupy a neighbour country and failed multiple times, I would not talk about it as well
Yeah I think my friend told me her parents watch everything dubbed in Italian
We also conquered Madrid for 40 days and had Galicia for three months, yet we never really learn about it
Lost it again some years later
What are the most modern looking places in your country
I consider myself very fortunate to have been born and to be living in Europe, and a big part of that is due to our cultural heritage
There are places in Europe that have remained (mostly) unchanged for centuries, and as such we can see a lot of examples of different architectural styles and movements
I love that so many major cities in Europe have done a great job at preserving buildings from their past
That being said, I'm a big fan of modern architecture and infrastructure as well
A lot of my favourite architects can be classified as "modern", such as Mies van der Rohe, Siza Vieira, Peter Zumthor, Zaha Hadid, Rem Koolhaas, and Tadao Ando (him especially)
I love seeing renders and proposals for modern infrastructure
I'd like to know what are the most modern looking places in your country
I know for instance that a lot of business/financial districts have a more modern look, as do a lot of places in cities such as Berlin and Rotterdam
What do you consider to be examples of modern infrastructure in your country
Are there any places that you feel look like they were ripped straight from the future
Probably Parque das Nações, in Lisbon
It is the neighborhood where I live, but this is an unbiased opinion
I love Rotterdam
The city center looks like an architect playground
So many interesting buildings everywhere you look
I came here to know what you'd think of the most modern place in Portugal, for I think it is the parque das nações too, and I don't live in Lisbon :) I love it though
Defenetly Parque das Nações
There is a village in Northern Portugal called Tó (an old Portuguese word for pig, and nowadays it's used as a shortened form of the name António)
I don't know if there are more two letters place names, but I would guess there are
The shortest city name is probably Beja, I think
There's one called 'Pó' (meaning 'Dust') not far from where I live
EDIT:
>The shortest city name is probably Beja, I think
Also, Faro
Horta could be the shortest, but Portuguese spelling rules insist on keeping these useless silent Hs at the start of the words
That's cool, why would they name the village Pó?
It would still have the same length as Beja though
Well, according to wikipedia:
> Segundo alguns autores, a povoação terá tomado o nome do apelido da família Pó, que tinha propriedades neste lugar, mas também se poderá admitir ter acontecido que esta família tenha assumido o nome da aldeia onde residia
So it's a possibility
Pior  imagina um gajo chamado Pó
Romanian is a no go
Italian is the second hardest, though I understand it better spoken than written
Spanish and french is kind of cheating because I do know them and can read it, slowly
Catalan I understand well sometimes, sometimes not
You forgot galician
Weird spelling they use though
Portuguese speaker here
I'd order it this way:
Galician- It's basically Portuguese with some Spanish words sprinkled in
Spanish- Almost all of the words are similar to Portuguese, and those that aren't, I either know or can easily infer what it's saying
Catalan, Italian and French- Many words are close to Portuguese, but I need to spend some time trying to read the whole phrase, and trying to get the context to correctly understanding it
Romanian- the first time I saw Romanian I was surprised how many words are similar
But it's a strange language
It starts to seem like Portuguese with a few strange symbols, but then it veers off, and a different word appears
While I do understand some words, I can no longer read the whole phrase
**French:** I could read practically everything (80%), but I also had 3 years of French during highs-school
**Spanish:** Understood 100%
**Italian:** Had to read more carefully and I didn't understand a few words, understood about 70%.
**Catalan:** the article was very short, but I was able to understand everything
**Romanian:** Had a bit more trouble, a bit more difficult than Italian, about 65%.
**Galician:** looks like a mix between Spanish and Portuguese, also understood 100%.
French, about 80%. Briefly talked about a theatre play and it's context
Spanish: 100%. A short line about a canadian judoka
Italian: 90%. An article about Ptolomy II, Egyptian Pharaoh from the Ptolemaic period
Portuguese: 100% (my first language)
An article about the colour red
Romanian: 20%. I understand the content - it's about Brazil, but I struggle to understand the words
Catalan: 100%. A short line about a Remomeix - a french municipalty
Galician: 100%. An article about the July Days (1917) in Russia
Portuguese here
Galician is the easiest by far
Nearly all the words have cognates with Portuguese and the word order is exactly the same
95% comprehension
Ironically, the Spanish article was about the "Italian economic miracle" (lol)
It was very easy to understand, but I guess that's a given
80% comprehension
Catalan is just slightly harder than Spanish, but fairly comprehensible nevertheless
75% comprehension
French was fairly easy to grasp, but I did learn the language in middle school
Even if I can't speak a word of it, I guess it still stuck
60% comprehension
Italian is surprisingly hard for me
I can understand what the article is about, but the details were nearly impossible
30% comprehension
Romanian is slightly harder than Italian and the hardest by far
20% comprehension
For a Portuguese Native Speaker like myself, Portuguese was the easiest (obviously), but putting it aside I would say Galician was easiest for me: it's really simillar to portuguese, and I could understood pretty much everything in the article (it just looked like portuguese but with some spanish flavour added in, like spanish vocabullary and different spellings)
Spanish was the 2nd easiest, as it's also very close to portuguese, although less than Galician
The 3rd easiest was Italian, although it might be because lf the article's subject being easy to understand (planet earth)
In 4th place is the French article, which I mostly understood well, except for the word "passacadillo" or something like that, but besides that I could understand everything if I put in enough effort
In 5th was Catalan, this is sort of a hard language in the Romance family because it combines the parts of spanish and french that portuguese people don't understand so well
The article was very short though, it was just one paragraph, so maybe it depends on the article
Finally Romanian was the hardest by far: I understood little to none of the article, I only know that it's about The Night of the Living Dead" because it said the english movie title in the article, otherwise I wouldn't get it
I understood everything in the Spanish one, the Italian one and the French one, which opened up (convienently) a page about that famous painting of Napoleon on his horse crossing the Alps, which I also understood thoroughly
I had some trouble with Catalan and Romanian
Surprisingly, I understood everything written in Portuguese
Fantastic
> Gallego: a former province of portugal,
No, LOL
You say that Spanish and Italian are very similar but, as a Portuguese (fluent in French too), I understand 95% of Spanish but I find Italian difficult to read
Or is Russian drunk Portuguese
Hmm
Salvaterra do Minho maybe, it is just a town
Calling it a province would be extremely misleading
Portuguese translations of books keep the original names of characters
Based on the rest of this thread, this might seem strange to some people
(This comment doesn't apply to the Brazilian Portuguese translations
In Harry Potter, instead of changing the character's name to fit the language, "Tom Marvolo Riddle" still unscrambles to "I am Lord Voldemort" written in English and there's a footnote translating that to Portuguese
Planet of the Apes -> O Homem Que Veio Do Futuro (The Man From The Future)
The Girl Who Played with Fire -> A Rapariga que Sonhava com uma Lata de Gasolina e um Fósforo (The Girl Who Dreamt Of A Gas Can And A Match)
Lock Up -> Stallone Prisioneiro (Inmate Stallone)
Not always unfortunarely
ASoIaF is an example of translated names/cities that went terribly wrong
Brazilian Portuguese translations*
We, for the most part, keep the original names and spelling
I wish they had kept the original names there, specially considering they did keep some names because they didn't have an obvious translation
That being said, they translated some city names but not character names, so my previous comment is still technically correct
Wont argue much more but your comment is not correct
Maybe older editions do what you say, but not new ones for sure
Been that way since the 50's, I think
> surprised Portugal is different in that regard
Maybe it's related to the fact that we also subtitle instead of dubbing, initially to keep people from watching too many foreign movies (since they couldn't read), but later on kept to help language (English) learning
Plus, smaller European countries traditionally sub instead of dub
I know it's not correct for everything (the names of many Asterix characters were translated) but, as far as I know, none of the character names in ASOIAF were translated
Cities aren't characters and nicknames of characters aren't character names
Not all
If you read A song of Ice and Fire they have translated cities like Kings Landing to Porto Real
That is why I've read the originals instead of the translations
Well, not only that, they have also edited 5 of the original books and turned them into 10 books
I mean, it sucks if a historical building like that is lost forever, but I wouldn't say I feel like it's a personal loss of mine
I'm not French
Kinda both foreign and losing, strange
Its sad
People here love to honk in traffic must be a souther European thing
They honk over minor stuff
I remember when I was in taking my driving licence in the driving lessons people honk at me, I was not making mistakes was just being a bit low because I was learning how to drive
Not sure if this applies to all Bulgarians, but I had a friend who I met during my master's and she could be blunt and tell it like it is, but in a way that never came across as mean or rude
I absolutely loved that about her
It was like a reverse of all the unnecessary euphemisms you sometimes come across in the UK
Same with me taking driving lessons
You'd think people would be more understanding but they really don't care
Hahahahaha
You know
Lmao if anything they usually say the opposite
Yeah I had it drilled into me that I should always look at my mirrors when exiting a roundabout
But what I meant with my comment is that I've had instructors tell me that bad driving habits are something you should leave until after you get your license
As in "focus on driving impeccably until you've passed your exam, after that you can bend the rules a little".
Ehm, everyone "insults" their own country but if someone's insults we start fighting, so I guess the hate for the capital is normal
The vatican city
Lisbon i guess
Like people from Porto have a rivalry but when they meet the city they end up liking it (generally speaking)
The problem with this question is that is there always someone who dislikes a city for no reason and its not only 1 person its multiple people who then can influence their irrational opinions on others
Naaah, if someone says they don't like Lisbon I'm right there with them
Gotta give us jobs ;)
Mhmmm, I prefer Barcelona cuz I never went to Madrid sorry :/
We had a few fallen governments
Mostly they've fallen vecause of money, budget
The last one was in 2011 when our lovely corrupt social democratic prime minister kindly helped tank our economy leaving us no choice but to get an international bail out
Guess which party was back in power 5 years later and has been since
Liberal surge
Well, that depends on your age
No one expects an old person to speak anything other than Portuguese, especially if they don't have much education
As for younger people, you're expected to at least be able to understand English
Most people know a second language, and tend to be fluent with that second language, only the older generation are the exception
It's seen has a valuable trait since Portugal is an international and diverse country, we have a lot of tourists and we tend to be helpful with anyone in need so communication is important
It's also a valuable trait since a lot of Portuguese people migrate (even in the most unlikely places on this earth there's Portuguese, we are everywhere)
I'm not sure if a major part of the younger generations understands well English
For people who have at least a bachelor degree I would say almost all of them are fluent in English, but I found that people who have never been to university are likely to struggle understanding English
I had several classmates at uni who didn't exactly excel at English either to be honest
I don't think it's that linear
Spanish is taught in Portugal, it’s not mandatory like English is
We can choose between French, German and Spanish
Also, Portuguese isn’t mandatory in Spain as well
No, not really
It's not compulsory
Only English is
And French used to be as well
You can learn a third optional language here, and you could choose Spanish
But spanish is extremely similar to portuguese, if both parties speak slowly we can sort of communicate
I see why you would think that we would learn Spanish, but the funny thing is that our countries exert surprisingly little influence on one and other
Although we are from the same roots and are very similar, historically we have been somewhat separated
Here's an example of what I'm trying to say: I know many people who have worked in France, or emigrated to the UK, but not that many with a history with Spain
The thing is you have English as a mandatory language from very soon, since primary school until you finish high school
Nevertheless, you reach the 7th grade (age of 12/13) and you have to choose a second language to learn until high school
Normally you have 3 possibilities: French, Spanish and german (in high school some schools may offer you italian or even latin)
I guess most of students choose french, because it's useful and we have lots of portuguese communities in French speaking countries (France, Belgium, Switzerland or Luxembourg)
Other students may choose Spanish because it's easier and people here normally know the basics of spanish because it's much similar
No one really choose to learn german
But I think if you ask a random portuguese which second language he speaks better first would be English, second would be French and just after these two would be Spanish
It's actually more common to learn French than Spanish here
It's not mandatory and it's also not really need since we can pretty much understand each other for the most part, English is mandatory, other foreign language are optional and we tend to choose overwhelming French over the options between Spanish, French or German
My experience from university says that not everyone excels at it, not everyone is 100% fluent but everyone should at least understand and are able to speak the basics
I've never met anyone at university who didn't understand english
I think most young people understand the basics
Tons of people I've met in my school days who had bad grades at English were still able to enjoy music in that language and understand the gist of it
They had a passive understanding of the language but struggled at speaking it themselves and also made a lot of grammatical mistakes
I'm gonna guess when it comes to university it will depend a lot on the degree a student is pursuing
In a humanities degree you'll definitely need good English skills since a lot of the material you'll be studying for tests/exams and writing essays about history, sociology, economics, anthropology, philosophy, political science, etc
is in English
Still, I had several classmates in my degree that weren't fluent in the language and needed to Google words or check the dictionary for their meaning
I guess in a degree that's heavier on math you can get by more easily without being fluent in English
I know right
It's pretty weird
My degree is in economics (also heavy in maths), but we started to have classes in English since very soon, which helps a lot
But still most of the professors would let you make a presentation or do the exams in portuguese, so if you struggled at english, that would not cause you a big trouble
And tbh why would you guys even need to learn Portuguese
It really isn't that useful of a language
Ah well Economics is considered a social science, even though it has a lot of maths
I was thinking more in the line of engineering degrees, architecture, mathematics bachelors, accounting and finance, etc
Yes
Just like it would be to open their closet and drawers
Same in Portugal
Portugal and Spain have had its fights, but still are the closest they could be (one could say they are the same, don't kill me please)
I have a spanish right next to me that begs to differ(portuguese here) but yes i know what you mean, but still we are so close
Do you consider yourself more of a galician than spanish
(Pardon my questions)
Do you feel like that's a feeling shared with the majority of the galicians
That's very interesting
Is there any such thing as independence movement, the likes of catalonia
José Manuel Durão Barroso
Opportunistic parasite and I would like to have it impossible for him to ever get the prestige of the presidency
At the same time, I am curious to see what my Portuguese companions would do with him in elections
But then I remember they voted a second turn on Cavaco Silva and yeah, lets not risk it
One of those assholes at TAP or Novo Banco that instead of trying to actualy run a good business they just suck up all of our tax money and share it with their friends
This right here wins the Portuguese comments
Don't you think the problem is in the politicians that actually enable them to do this and keep giving them more money ? (Cough cough Costa cough cough )
At least one of those is loyal to his ideals (I'm not supporting him in anyway tho)
Exactly this ^^^
Have you ever heard of the House of Lords
Yes
We have a very comprehensive list of names allowed (though imo it´s getting way too lenient)
One way to spell a name and no gender neutral names
Ahhhh we also have a few rules in Portugal
there's lists with banned names, honestly it's pretty shitty for immigrants registering their children here
I'm a big fan of the system here in Portugal, every child deserves to grow up with a normal name imo
I believe they've become more lax with names in recent years, at least with regards to foreign names
I know a young couple with a child named Kevin, and a girl I know recently had a child which she named Luke
The gendered name helps with identification on formal documents without we actually having to look at the person
It just avoids a lot of complication
Besides, Romance languages - and most other European ones, too - are gendered on itself
In Portuguese, just by saying "thank you", people will know your gender immediately
EDIT: I guess French is an exception, judging by another comment
The names in the list are mere examples of valid names and only applies if the child is born in Portugal with no foreign parents
Otherwise, they can name their child according to their nation rules
Source:
The thing is that around European countries we don't have the tendency to recreate names, they're usually pretty straight forward
We may import, but normally we all kind of agree that it's best to pick decent names
>  but not a living sibling's name
I don't think you can use a dead sibling's name either, here
unfortunately sometimes monstrosities like Lyonce Viiktórya will still get aproved
ohhh did not know that part, nonetheless many portuguese parents have gone onto the "foreign-name" attempt and then it's refused
Are these guidelines any recent
I know a handful of people (most if not all not even descended from migrants) whose names would break one of these rules
Similarly in Portugal you'd have to give a name from the God parents
(In Portugal we often use two first names so you can circumvent it though)
>unfortunately sometimes monstrosities like Lyonce Viiktórya will still get aproved
Because one of the parents is not Portuguese
Foreign parents have leeway
It is weird, because Yannick Djaló is Portuguese, he even played for the national team, their mother is Portuguese, and yet they accepted the names
Ahahah those sound like knock off brands
Not exclusive to formal documents; it's just a good piece of information to infer by just seeing the name of the person
It avoids awkward situations in communication
Like, if you writing an email to someone you just know the name of and never seen physically, you'll still be able to tell which gender to use in your writing
EDIT: Just to clarify: Romance languages are gendered
That means every time you use an adjective, for instance, you need to alter the suffix in accordance to the gender of the noun it's referring to
So, to say a woman is **tall** you'd say "alt**a**", but to say a man is tall, you'd say "alt**o**".
Some people are just plain stupid
I feel like some names that are proposed would only hurt the child in the future
I think they've relaxed the rules somewhat because I know some people who've given their children foreign names (like Kevin and Luke)
But Yannick Djaló is Portuguese, he even played for the national team
he's a dual national with Guinean citizenship, I think
The question asked "does any of the parents hold any nationality not Portuguese
" And Yannick is (probably) also a Guiné Bissau citizen
Wiki tells me he was born in Guinea-Bissau
Not sure if they're the best, but I quite like the CCB (Centro Cultural de Belém) and the Calouste Gulbenkian Museum in Lisbon
In my opinion, I'd say Museu Gulbenkian, in Lisboa
Of all the Museums in Portugal, my favorite is the Museu Gulbenkian
[Museu Nacional the Arte Antiga] has it has a beautiful collection of art in Lisbon
Amazing
It's very beautiful
O Museu Gulbenkian é uma coleção privada super pequena
Será este mesmo o melhor museu de Portugal
Se calhar não, mas é o meu favorito
A colecção Gulbenkian não é assim tão pequena, acho eu
My parents sometimes speak to each other in English at family gatherings
My sister and I sometimes do the same when we're at our grandparents' house
My mom used english
Which o now know as good/better than her
Yeah my parents would speak in English when me and my siblings were young
Depends on the scenario
I used to start speaking in English until I realized that's actually rather rude
That being said, if the person is really struggling to communicate then I ask if we can speak in English instead to speed things up a little
It can be a counterproductive specially if they learn brazillian and are trying to use it with a foreign accent on top (I actually get totally confused about if trem is train or tram and just please, english)
But then there is a special class of tourist who try very hard to use their spanish as a foreign languahe in Portugal
Often they speak english as their native language
Spanish is close, but it is different enough in 5% of the words to totally throw you in a spin, and foreigners who learnt spanish they never ever understand spoken Portuguese back, so please please, english if you do not mind
Spanish is much harder and then they do not understand what I speak
I can not speak spanish, I can understand it, with a lot of stumbling blocks, but I understand english soooo much better
The smell of smoke of burnt pine and eucalyptus trees
The smell of the sea, some beach on the south west coast
Salt, iodine, and wind, and some herbs maybe
My country would smell of the Atlantic
Or of pine trees, or of rosemary, or of oregano, parsley and coriander
I was expecting someone would say port wine or grilled fish but that just makes me sad
With a little hint of salty codfish and dry weeds ( codfish for the whole nation and dry weeds for those areas that usually don't burn - Alentejo)
On a more positive note: traditional towns in Portugal do have a distinctive smell
Areas of Lisbon smell like Basil and White-Blue soap
That smell overwhelmes every other smell, unfortunately
Don’t forget fig trees
Or of apples and wine, and of good comforting food
This make me sad too
It's depressing to see the country burn every summer
Yeah, everyone is saying good smells from their country and I say this hahaha
Port wine or grilled fish are great and represent Portugal really well
Yes unfortunately
Wildfire are extremely common, the biggest tragedy in modern Portuguese history is the 2017 Pedrogão wildfire which killed 60+ people in an afternoon
Apart from the costal towns and cities everything is going down population wise
The biggest issue is the lack of access to education and medical services seeing that a lot of primary schools get underfunded for lack of students and then eventually shut down making kids travel to other villages or having to go to the closest city for education
I'm from a district capital in the interior and even the hospital can't do several thing because they simply don't have the equipment
For instance cancer treatments you'd have to travel about 150km to do it because if there isn't a lot of people living in the city you don't really get a lot of support
The desertification of the interior is a big issue here and the government tries to help but what you get is just a very very boring day to day without many things to do or try so you just fall into the Portuguese routine of going to work and going home and to the cafe inbetween
Adult population around 80 percent
We might fall from 10 million in a few years
Big demographic crisis
HALF OF THE POPULATION IN THE 2 BIGGEST DISTRICT CITIES (Porto, Lisbon) Lisbon still grows but the interior is getting deserted quick
Damm you Spaniards
Always with your ambition to conquer us
You will fail e every time
Come forward Portuguese Baker women, destroy the Spanish army
/s (joke)
Once upon a time
You were thinking about us in the past
Or in the future (hopefully in the future if the economy gets better)
[Well, about that
That is a comic from 1958
Prussia hasn't been a thing since 1871 if you consider the unification of Germany, 1918 if you consider their change from a kingdom to a state within Germany after the collapse of the constituent monarchies of the country (or what was the German Empire at the time) following the German Revolution
>1918 if you consider their change from a kingdom to a state
I was referring specifically to the kingdom itself as a nation
The Free State of Prussia was fully incorporated into the Weimar Republic and was one of its federal subjects
I'd have to say Lisbon - London - Berlin - Vienna - Budapest
But I've got to tell you that, and this might have been just me having a bad experience, but if are to visit either Vienna or Budapest, keep your head down, I'm European and I've had people, let's say, not be that welcoming to me in both cities
They're beautiful cities nonetheless, tho
Porto *is* special
Wien is the absolute best
I go back every year in the Winter
I hope COVID doesn't ruin it for me next time
Sagres, wow
Beautiful, but didn't expect to see it here ️
Can confirm, Porto is indeed super beautiful
That's debatable
If one wants to visit less touristy cities sure but is Liverpool more interesting and representative of the UK (and Europe) than London
For instance I loved Cork but if I had to pick one city for someone that's going to visit Ireland for the first time I'm still choosing Dublin
Oh no, it's not about crime, at all, at least not that kind
The thing is the, I don't want to say "racism", bcs I don't feel it was just that, at least in Hungary, but what happened was that, (I was in the two cities like one after the other, btw) in Vienna, me and my Portuguese friend had two incidents with older people calling workers inside the train, telling him to ask us to get out of the train or move to a different carriage
The last one was the worst tho
We were with a German girl we'd met a few days earlier and when the old chap came to us and starting saying some shit to our faces, she intervened
I speak very little German, but I heard "blah blah blah Jude blah blah" (Jude means Jew, in German), and when we asked what he was saying to her, she said he was being very disrespectful towards us, specially to me (I'm Jewish, obviously)
In Hungary we were outright intimated to leave like a restaurant/bar by a group of guys in black saying that we didn't belong there, which was kind of terrifying
I believe those to be isolated incidents, but they did still happen and I didn't feel a bit comfortable
Apart from that, younger and not bald blackshirt people seem to be quite nice
It's a bit expensive
But to give you and idea, all included (travel, hotel and expenses) I spend around 1100-1200€ for 5 nights for 2 persons
The hotel is nothing fancy, but it's decent
I go to restaurants: 1 meal in a fancier restaurant, the rest in any other
I buy Mozart chocolates, Sachertorte and Apfelstrudel, Kaiserschmarren, etc
I visited some museums, and monuments (but don't any more, because there's none that interest me and that I haven't seen)
I go to Prater amusement Park (ride the giant wheel and play some arcade), and I always go ice-skating near Rathaus
And I still bring some souvenirs
The only thing whose price truly shocked me was the Espresso, because I'm used to pay no more than 0
60€ in Portugal
There are some major attractions, such as the Opera, that are very expensive
I guess Winter makes it cheaper
But I think it's best: I've more than enough heat and Sun in my country, plus the streets during that time are nearly empty
Bottom line: it's not much at all if you really like to go there and can save some Euros throughout the year
In Portugal, Delta is the most popular, and for me it's the best tasting brand
But it also depends on the machine where the expresso is made
Delta ruby type
Far the best one I ever tasted in Europe
The Italian ones are good too but i think delta has a little more flavors in their coffees
Portuguese coffee is VERY underrated
Delta and Sical are absolutely delicious and it’s what I miss the most when I’m traveling
The only country I’ve been that has similar quality coffee is Italy
Delta is considered by many a quality coffee, and in my opinion far surpasses many other coffees I've tasted
A surprinsigly good coffee machine of portuguese make is the [Dimobilli] the ground coffee option makes extremely good expressos
I used to buy Intermezzo because of its excellent price/quality but had to quit buying it because more often than not I would find small twigs, sometimes more than one in a 500g package
You buy a pack of Delta, and when it says produced it says his full name "Manuel Rui Azinhais Nabeiro", and the Campo Maior address
His full personal name is on every package and yeah, he could care if it was no good
That coffee machine makes THE BEST coffee, life changer
And it’s very cheap too
It is, and it comes with 3 different accessories so you can use ground coffee, capsules or coffee pods
How arrogant do you have to be to tell an Italian, from the country that invented espresso, who probably drinks a few every day since they were a teen, that Illy or Lavazza is not a coffee shop
Seriously
I'm Portuguese my wife is Russian we both live in Portugal
Biggest difference while dating was the fact that Russian woman care more about old fashion gentleman behavior than Portuguese, we meet 4 yrs ago start living together 2 yrs ago and we marry around 1 yr
Our relationship in the last 4 years is going great
Both of us have emotional and direct personality but even in the times that we quarrel we end up making peace in 1 hour maximum
My parents love her, and when I meet her parents in Russia they were always very friendly to me
Even if two people come from different cultures, as far as they respect each others space and devide home tasks, everything will go fine
I dated a swedish girl for 8 months it was really good especially seeing how different our cultures was
I enjoyed learning about their culture and now I kinda want to live there
I'm dating a Czech guy
It's been very interesting
He works remotely so he's with me in Portugal for most of the year and then goes back to Czech usually in the winter and a bit of summer
The biggest difference has been the food for sure
He says our food is amazing but our beer is shit
While for me I have a bit of hard time eating their recipes because they are far heavier than I'm used to, loads of potatoes, oil and heavy sauce
Another thing I noticed is that they are much more independent from their family
Here families are quite close and it's normal for people to live with their parents until their late 20s, have family lunches on the weekend and so on
There kids do whatever they want and are expected to be married and with kids of their own in their early 20s.
I've enjoyed learning a lot about his culture and showing him mine
Visiting each others countries is always lots of fun
The different language has been an interesting challenge
Trying to get his mom to like me when she doesn't speak a word of English was nerve wrecking but apparently she really likes me (somehow) so that's a win
And I would say the biggest challenge was right at the start, more than "typical" relationships, there was more missteps and miscommunication due to the cultural differences which we had to overcome by communicating more explicitly than is typical, before we were fully confortable with each other
Please tell me she wears a beret
Yup we in south Europe think that lunches that end up as dinners are normals until someone tells us that they aren’t
Hhahga e um cafézinho também
Can only speak for Portugal but I think it's also due to the language barrier
Like with my Portuguese friends we make a lot of subtle and sarcastic jokes
A lot of observational humour
And I do that with native English speaking friends as well
But I've been in situations were I've had both types of friends together and if the native English speaker makes a witty remark or subtle joke the Portuguese friend won't find it funny despite understanding English
I think a lot of the subtlety is lost depending on your grasp of the language
An English tourist was trying to ask for a muffin in Portuguese
She was supposed to say "quero um queque", but she ended up saying "quero uma queca", which means "I want sex".
I'm Portuguese, in middle school when we started learning French, some students wouldn't shut up about merci bom cu, almost identical to French pronunciation and some had a thick accent so many of us would always laugh even if they didn't mean to
Well, there's a funny mistake that happens when Portuguese people try to speak Spanish
The words embaraçado/a (PT) and embarazado/a (SP) are very similar, however, the first means embarrassed and the second means pregnant
They sound exactly the same in Portuguese, so a common childish joke is to ask someone their age, "Quantos anos tens
" ("How many years do you have
"), and say you answer 15 they begin to laugh and say you have 15 anuses
Context is everything
Not really
Normally after the elections there's some analysis by age and it's mostly: young, working age and pensioner
We usually don't name every generation
Historically only a handful ever get names, most don't.
Modern examples:
Like our generation from the early 90s (94-95) was named "geração rasca" = trashy generation
The generation of the economic crisis (around 2008-2011) was named "geração à rasca" = struggling generation
[wiki source]
It depends on country, for example here in Portugal no one cares about boomers or generation y and z etc
Now in the context of political and social issues we kinda talk about age discrimination although it doesn't receive enough attention (like people around 50 that are far from the retirement age but can't get a job because of their age or the young adult not being able to get a job in their areas of study because every job asks for experience but they don't have it because they are looking for a first job, or the fact that at age 16 you are criminally responsible but can not vote including emancipated minors that might be married working and paying taxes but can't participated in the political discussion [on side note this is debated in law especially fundamental rights classes, BTW law student, my position at either put the criminal responsibility to 18 or give at very least the right to vote at 16 to emancipated minors]) or to the rapid loss in young people and the problems that occurred to the social security because of ageing population, etc
In Portugal, in Porto (North of Portugal) have a lot of abandoned houses that are closed with bricks because usually drug addicts used to live in the places that where already abandoned
I sometimes imagine when i pass on one of those buildings that if someone was forgotten there and never could go out from there
The other place and one of the well known from here, similar to the case of Le Vele in Italy, we had a neighborhood called Bairro do Aleixo that was almost completely controlled by drug trafficking and it was like a drug market for people who wanted to buy
The towers were suffering degradation and the atmosphere was really scary
People would inject in plain sight in that place and stuff
Determiners: o and a
Conjunctions: e (means "and")
Then there's: ó, which is an interjection, when you're calling someone (v.g. Ó Carlos
= Hey Charles
(In archaic portuguese it used to be the contraction of a+o, which we nowadays write "ao", meaning "to", even though many accents still pronounce it "ó")
There's also: à contraction of a+a, meaning "to" as well
And then, there's é - which means is, verb "ser" (to be) third person conjugation, present simple
'' é '' which means '' is ''
Portuguese:
A/O - The
e - and
a - to / female form of the
o - male form of the
à - contraction of a (to) and a (female form of the)
e - and
é - is, as in he is, she is
ó - oh, hey you
And in Mirandese they have l - male form of the
e-and
a-the(feminine)
o-the(masculine)
(portuguese btw)
Thats basicaly it
> why is it spelled this way
It's a french loanword
Only if you're bragging about it
Complaining of how little we earn is almost a national pass time
I don't mind talking about it with my friends and family but I don't think I'd bring up that conversation with anyone else (unless for financial advice)
If they don't want to talk about it that's fine but I don't see it as a taboo subject
I don’t think it’s rude, we’re always bitching about it
I would say it’s tasteless to say specific numbers, but not rude
Green olives by far
In restaurants you are always given green olives as appetizer
I only see black olives in pizza
Edit: I just talked to family and friends and it seems that black olives were more popular in the olden times because they are easier to make
Green olives need to be treated to not taste like crap, and can be a byproduct of Olive oil production
According to my southern portuguese family, green olives are now much more popular in the South than in the North
My knowledge from the North is not the best so I assumed it was the same all over the country, sorry
depends on the dish, doesn't it
fish is usually accompanied by black olives and meat dishes by green or cut brown olives
at least when dishes are prepared in a restaurant
when at home, black olives are the default as to not complicate things
And in Alentejo
They produce a lot of olives, and when I go there, I always find as  green as black olives
In Santarém green olives are the most popular  they are given as appetizers in restaurants and everyone i know likes them better than the black ones , even though I prefer them
You get the olives (and bread, cheese, sardine paste,etc
) but you need to pay
If you don't want the apperizers you can just say no and they take it from the table
A lot of turists are tricked in to thinking that it is free and when they are paying they realise the extra € they were not anticipating
So, if you go to Portugal and don't want the appetizers just say so, but if you want them you are going to pay (but its not expensive)
This is an interesting question
they come up in the news, but its nothing really awesome, at least that I can remember
at the same time I think that, generally speaking, we don’t care much about space relate news
The Portuguese president is mostly a figure head and is a representative that always should try and promote debate
He has the power to "nuke" the parliament and veto laws, but if he abuses veto power he's gonna grow largely unpopular and never be reelected (they also need a justification for it, but most of the times it's "there hasn't been enough debate") . He can't pass laws by himself, only the ones that have been passed in the parliament
He's also the one that sets the date for the parliamentary elections
I think the true balance of power doesn't come exactly from the President / Prime minister relation, but largely from the Parliament power
Here the president appoints the Prime Minister, but that's basically defined by whatever the Parliament elections turn out to
And he has the power to dissolve the government and/or the Parliament altogether
Another powers include being the head of the military, even though the ministry of defence is where the authority comes from in practice
The president has the power of veto over whatever the Parliament approves, but can only do so one
If the Parliament decides again to approve the exact same law again, it can't be vetoed
Only the constitutional court can then rule something unconstitutional
Other than that, it's the usual background politics, mostly
Keeping parties talking, etc
I really like our political system
I think it achieves balance via the Parliament
We have 10 parties represented, and there isn't the feel that there is one point of absolute power
Only the rare case of absolute parliament majority, but even that doesn't feel as "absolutist" as presidential systems
Parliaments, people, parliaments are the most important democratic tool
Exactly
The only area where the President and the Government actually share power is Diplomacy
Everything else is basically just oversight
Just a side note
>Before that Vigdis Finnbogadottir (world's first female prez)
I have seen other Icelanders saying this before
She was the first to run on her own for president and being elected, that is correct
But she wasn't the first female president worldwide
There were a few before
The Soviets had quite a few in their republics
The first in a democratically elected position was Isabel Martinez de Peron, Argentina, but she was elected as VP and inherited the role
Yes, they do
And they take public transportation if the autarchy sponsored transportation isn't available
In Portugal Kids go to school alone round 14 yrs old
In my area, unless they have public transportation paid by the municipality, the parents will drive their kids to school
There's some irrational fear of leaving the kids on their own, that everything is super dangerous nowadays
I would say that happens, in big cities, if the school is nearby – close walking distance, that is
If not, parents will take the kids
In smaller cities, AFAIK kids go to school on their own
I live in Lisboa and teach in a school in Loures
Many parents take their kids to school but, i come across my students in the bus sometimes and I find younger children too
When I take the bus in Lisboa I find many children too, some younger than 10
I live in the countryside, and the bus that takes the students to school it's the normal public transportation bus, where the municipality pays the monthly tickets for the students that live more than 3km away from the school
Besides them only elderly people takes the bus, because public transit is so scarce, that it can be quite difficult to live without your own car
So, it kinda feels like a school bus, when in reality isn't. But I really mean it, when I say that people here are always complaining that things are getting more dangerous, "ninguém respeita nada nem ninguém", I think that's a CMTV effect
Yeah, CMTV is full of bandits, kidnappers and shady drug dealers
Lisboa is easier and safer in that aspect
Our country, as a whole, is quite safe imo
It's in third place in the safest countries list
It's a safe place
I never worried too much
When my kid was young, he played outside, in the park, around our building, without much supervision since he reached 8 years
And from 12 years old on he comes and goes as he pleases
He's trustworthy and never misses school or his school work
Doesn't drink or smoke
If he shows up to eat and sleep, I'm OK
Most sober
Albania, Bosnia or any other country with sizable Muslim population
Most secular
I'd say either Estonia or Czechia
Have lifetime danish friends, can confirm: The Danes will drink like there's no tomorrow, then get up the next day and do it again
I can only assume their livers are permanently encased in alcohol, which keep them in stasis
Note to self, make some Finnish friends
It's hard to do, because the fuckers don't seem to come down here, makes it hard to start a conversation
We learn medieval Galician-Portuguese poetry (which usually were made into songs sung at court)
Honestly, it's not that different from modern Portuguese
At first glance, it might be hard to understand the meaning, but eventually you'll get there
I actually enjoyed learning it
There are three forms of this poetry: Cantigas de Amigo, which are about a young women in despair because of her loved one, Cantigas de Amor, about low-born men who fall in love with a high-born lady, and Cantigas de Escárnio e Maldizer, which are essentially Medieval Diss-Tracks
(I remember one called "Ugly Lady". The backstory was that the women was jealous of the troubadour because he always composed songs about how beautiful other ladies at court were, but never about her
She demanded him to write a song about her
He wrote a song about how ugly she was
Ptsd flashbacks from  portuguese high school classes intensifies
Wait, really
What year
I don't remember ever learning that
Then again, I left school in 2007
Here's the Cantiga Dona Fea
Typo
Thanks for pointing that out
Using loanwords that are usually shortened in Portuguese
One that's common in several languages is saying "mail" instead of "e-mail" which is fine in Portuguese because "mail" alone has no other meaning, but in English "mail" doesn't mean the same as "e-mail". Same with "phones" for earphones/headphones, and I'm sure there's others I can't think of right now
And there's some grammatical ones like:
Not changing word order for questions, e.g. "You are coming
" instead of "Are you coming
Asking just the name of a person or thing to ask where it is, e.g. "The car keys
" instead of "Where are the car keys
Comparatives with "more" for every adjective, e.g. "more bright" instead of "brighter".
Some passive voice constructions like "it was committed a crime" instead of "a crime was committed".
You can often see in portuguese people's instagram bios something like "25y" or "25 years" when referring to their age
You can also hear them say "I have 20 years"
Portuguese people also say that they have a "doubt" instead of a "question"
Yeah, French speakers do the same
Same in Portuguese: actualmente
I'm starting to think it's the English that's wrong ahah
And in Portuguese : actualmente
What was your funniest "wait, you're from my country too" moment
Back in our 12th grade, we went to London during Spring Break and while we were waiting for the changing of the guard at the Buckingham Palace, some of my classmates started chanting "BENFICA
", out of boredom
To our dismay, right behind us, a group of college age students shouted back "PORTO
", we all looked at each other and burst out laughing before they went back screaming which team was the best until our teachers told us to shut the hell up
What was your funny experience with a suprise countrymen abroad
ninguém do sporting hehe enfiem no cu sportinguistas haha 5 batatas contra o benfica lmao
Didn't the accent give it away
Ahaha
It's the equivalent to senior year in high school
We have 1 to 12 grade in Portugal
Now that you mention it, I  don't see many Turks in the North region
The Macarena is played religiously on every Portuguese wedding
It's a tradition since it came out
It gets people off their chairs and dance since everyone knows the dance by heart
And also Asereje by Las Ketchup
The woman's lyrics are in English
Basically, she's hot, she can't stand her boyfriend Victorino, he was out of town and his two friends were soooo fine

I am a lot better at getting jokes in person, I  swear :)
Not so much on the internet
In Portugal there are two models:
The old one, named Bilhete de Identidade (B.I. or Identity Ticket) and the new one, named Cartão de Cidadão (C.C. ir Citizen's Card)
The B.I. is not produced since 2008, but some old people still have the this one, as people from a certain age have a B.I. without expiration date
It is as valid as the C.C. The B.I. was simply a paper card with your identification
[B.I. Sample]
The new one is more interesting
It is a plastic card, that fused four or five cards together
It not only has your identification (like the B.I.), but also has your Tax Number, Heath Number and Social Security Number (before, each one of these had it's own card)
It also has a digital feature, where one can input your address, digital signature, medical and tax info and other specific information (this is just optional, if the card owner doesn't want it, they don't do it)
That data is encrypted, so that only the people who should access it can
The card digital feature also serves as the Digital European Passport
[C.C. Sample]
[the Portuguese is this one ]
Portuguese has I'd number, contributer number and social security number, name of your parents and your height
You can have an electronic reader and do pretty much everything at home with it
This is what the old portuguese ID looked like (plastified paper)
[Here is the comparison in size
] The current one is the size of a debit card
Don't foget about the newest ID format: the APP, Portugal now has an APP where you can have your ID and driver's license so you wont have to carry any cards with you
It's called id
gov
Oh wow a sério
Nem sabia disso xD
The Portuguese one has height as well
ya é brutal, e é  completamente válida, ou seja, se um polícia te mandar parar podes mostrar pela a aplicação que ele tem de aceitar
Ahaha não há nada melhor que esfregar a razão na cara de um bófia xD
Mas é só instalar, ou tens que ir à conservatória
Podes fazer o registo pela net e depois mandam para o correio um codigo que ativa isso
Pela net precisas da chave móvel que eu tb nao tinha e podes fazê-la pelo portal das finanças
Mas vais ao site id

pt e têm lá toda a informação
Hmm, tough one
Maybe, Lisbon, Lisbon, Lisbon, Lisbon and, maybe, Lisbon
Yeah, not much variation
To get a different answer, the time frame would have to be longer, maybe all the way to 1200
When Lisbon wasn't the de facto capital
Portugal is basically the Lisbon city state due to it historically being the best port location in the Iberian peninsula so our population has always been too concentrated in the capital (nearly 30%), unfortunately imo
The Porto metropolitan area is a close second but it has never been larger
I don't think that Lisbon was ever smaller than Coimbra, the previous capital
I'd guess that the only time it wasn't the largest city of the country, was before it was conquered, but I can't back that up, it's just a hunch
It's a very very old city, moreso than most capitals in Europe
So it was probably Porto until Lisbon was conquered, and Porto became forever in second place
The only shift in the top three must have been whenever Coimbra dropped lost 3rd place to Braga
If we're accounting for the territory and not the country, then maybe Bracara Augusta was larger than Olissipo during the roman times at some point, I dunno
I began learning English at the age of 5
At the time it wasn’t that common to study the language at that age and that gave me a huge advantage when we started learning it at school
I improved it with music, books and tv shows/movies
Nowadays I feel the need to improve my vocabulary I feel that I could tweak it up a bit
I think it was around in the 5th grade, being dyslexic it was hard to understand at first and really started to hate the language because of the hard time i had (the general methods of teaching aren't good for dyslexics or just insufficient), being dyslexic has you imagine makes reading subtitles quite hard especially when you are younger but i started to focus on watching movies and tv series in English with subs and slowly stated to understand the language, gaming was a big help (play English for the PsP XP), my teacher also gave a boost in moral, by the end of 5th grade i had a good fluency in the language but some problems with grammar
Around 7/8th i had become one of the best in my class, during the summer i also started to practice speaking with tourist kids (mostly non English native speaker) and forme good friendships with them
My growth in learning the language quickly skyrocketed and only around 10th grade started to slow down from there but still improving
In Portugal we don't dub movies or series for the most part (only kids content and some channels like the History channel do it), so that helped a lot
But I personally improved immensely my fluency when I started watching movies and series with English subtitles on university
English language has a weird writing system that doesn't match phonetically, so that was my way to connect the sounds with their orthography
My written English got better when I started participating in forums and such
Youtube and Games, like every person of this generation
I started learning when I was 8 or 9 years old in school but it wasn't until I was 13 that I really started grasping the language
Classes were good because they taught me grammar and pronunciation but I feel that I really started being more fluent and building my vocabulary when I started reading manga
The English translation would be out on Wednesdays and the Portuguese one on Saturdays so I started reading in English
I started learning in the 4th grade, but it was an after-school program and very light, like how to say hello, how to count, names of colors, and that's basically it
It was in 5th grade that I started learning English in school proper
At first I wasn't very good at it
In the diagnostic test at the very start I scored a 2 out of 5, which would be a failing grade if it counted
In the first real test my grade was Sufficient, or a 3 out of 5
In the second test my grade was Good, a 4 out of 5, and from then on in most of my tests I would be among the top of the class
Aside from school, I learned English from movies, TV shows, videogames, and later on from the Internet
All in all, it came very naturally in school, because of exposure to the English language outside of school
I wish I could say the same for French, but the best I could manage in the 3 years of French we had was answering questions about a text by copying the words from the answer and the text and filling in with words written in Portuguese because I didn't know how to write them in French
I did Erasmus in Lodz, Poland
It was either that or Warsaw, but due to certain subjects I preferred to go to Lodz
It is a... strange city
Manufaktura shopping and Piotrkowska street are great, but the city in general seems to be under construction all the time
I think there are no "strange" erasmus destinations
Each person has their on goal or reason to do Erasmus
While some want to party, others want to be in touch with poorer, more humble people
Myself, I wanted to experience living solo in a civilized place with a lower cost of living than where I'm from
I know an English guy who went to LMU Munich to study English Studies
Epic
My school was shit and the others had great schools, so
I really enjoyed having those students in my school from diferent countries, my favourite was a turkish kid, and my friend who had him in his house, invited me to go watch Endgame for the 2nd time with him, his mom and the turkish kid and it was great
The town I studied in
If you don't know Portuguese you're pretty much screwed
Very chill and relaxing, as well as cheap, but also a little boring
If you're not very social and don't get involved in uni activities it'll get boring for you fast
Oh I actually know one of these
I spent my Erasmus year at UCL in Louvain-la-Neuve, and while there I met this Flemish Erasmus student coming from KUL, in Leuven
Leuven to LLN is a full 30km apart
They're also originally the same university
Amazing stuff
I know someone who lived in Porto, Portugal and made Erasmus in Vigo, Spain, it is a 1h30min drive north on the atlantic coast
It's just weird
I did erasmus in Poland in the winter and it was great
In the city I was in I only got one day of snow which was great for the experience, it never rained which was awesome since rain in portugal is a pain in the ass every day of the winter months and the cold was totally tolerable
Maybe I was lucky, but I wouldn't change it for the world
Imagine going abroad to Badajoz as a Portuguese student, lol
Someone is living my dream
Odd choice of location, lol
That's even worse
Who goes to England to learn French, lol
I don't know about his grades, but he enjoyed partying quite often rather than studying (as most Erasmus students)
Can confirm
Many portuguese people choose Poland as their first choice because they find the country cheap and interesting, myself included
I even tried to learn polish but yeah
it's hard af
And hates French
Mcann I have some baguette please Monsieur
I can only identify things like Latin, Germanic, Slavic, Nordic, etc
And even then it's not fail proof
I'm more at ease identifying Iberians
We look the same, but there's a very clear distinction in temperament, and one of us tends to travel in large groups
Also the height and the amount of make-up tend to help destinguishing Spanish from Portuguese
General rule: if it looks Latin, somewhat stoic and quiet, and it's around 1,70m, it's very likely Portuguese
Not really
It's hard to distinguish my own nationality sometimes, some spanish and italians can look very similar to us
Yes and no
I used to work Summer jobs dealing with a lot of international customers, and after a while you can kind of guess where they come from based on a lot of factors
I'm not full proof at this and have definitely been wrong more than once
The thing is Portuguese people can look pretty different
Portuguese is not an ethnicity,,you do not spot it by eye color or facial structure
That being said, in Portugal, usually yes
Outside Portugal it is far more difficult because you assume everybody is foreigner . But there is this kind of facial language, the way people’s faces move, a certain expression about the eyes that can make you feel closer
I am pretty good at telling before they speak African descent portuguese people from non Portuguese African people
The facial expressions, the reactions, hair styles , even maybe facial symmetry and if the eyes are right or relaxed are different
If they speak then you know for sure, but you can usually tell a lot by clothes, body language and facial expressions
Facial language is different, closer, it just is
That happened to me in Switzerland
I was wrecking my brains trying to remember how do you ask for an express coffee in French
The lady behind the counter was Portuguese like me but I didn't know
I ended up asking for "un petit café", the lady almost died laughing
She did
She talked to me in Portuguese and gave me a decent coffee, bica as we say in Lisboa
[I send here an Instagram page that is dedicated to some portuguese expressions (with translation to english)]
Oh god so many, idk if others have it but here we have one that translates to “if you don’t have a dog hunt with a cat”
So many
These make absolutely no sense when translated, but I'll try my best to explain:
* **Tirar o cavalinho da chuva** (take your horse out of the rain) **-** it's never going to happen, you can give up;
* **Nascer com o rabo virado para a lua** (to be born with your ass turned to the moon) - to be very lucky, constantly, throughout life;
* **Vai pentear macacos** (go comb some monkeys) - leave me alone, go away;
* **Engolir sapos** (swallow frogs) - when you hear something you don't like, but keep your mouth shut instead of replying and starting an argument;
* **Pensar na morte da bezerra** (to think of the cow's death) - when someone is constantly dwelling over things that don't matter anymore / can't do anything to change;
* **Tás aqui, tás ali** (you are here, you are there) - you're going to get your ass kicked if you don't get out of my face;
* **Pulga atrás da orelha** (to have a flea behind your ear) **-** when you suspect something;
* **Acordar com os pés de fora** (to wake up with your feet outside the bed covers) - to be in a bad mood;
* **Pão pão, queijo queijo** (bread bread, cheese cheese) - to be very straightforward, pragmatic, realist;
* **Fazer de vela** (to be a candle) - the equivalent to being the third wheel;
* **Com uma perna às costas** (with a leg behind your back) **-** when something is very easy, you could do it with a leg behind your back;
* **Cu de judas** (Judas' ass) **-** a place that is very far away;
Desenmerda-te
Unshit yourself
It's the literal translation and it means to get your shit together, a bit of an oxymoron
In Portugal we say "Don't make a storm in a glass of water" :)
In Portugal, the equivalent is to not 'make a storm in a glass of water'
In Portugal we have the Class of Letters of the Academy of Sciences of Lisbon
The Academy of Sciences of Lisbon has two classes:
The Class of Sciences has the objective of standardising exact sciences and scientific language in portuguese, in accordance to the international nomenclatures
It also has the objective of encouraging scientific research
The Class of Letters has many objectives, one of them being stabilizing and regulating the portuguese language in Portugal (the class of letters also deals with other matters regarding human and economic sciences)
The Academy was founded in 1779, by a politician, a philosopher (who was also a linguist) and a natural scientist, and was adopted by Queen Maria I in 1783 as the official portuguese institute for standardisation
It's headquarters have one of the most beautiful libraries I have ever seen
I think the reason a lot of people assume Belgium is French-speaking only is due to Franco-Belgian comic book series like Tintin and fictional characters like Hercule Poirot which are French speaking
What did he think you speak
Austrian
That probably only happens in USA
Rodrigo leão os pretty neat and underrated even here in Portugal
"10 000 anos depois entre Vénus e Marte" prog rock album by José Cid
António Zambujo and Miguel Araújo are two portuguese singers that are quite famous here and are making success due to their different and innovative songs
The first one sings fado and the second is more of a rock and roll Singer and they perform together sometimes
I'm leaving here two live performances of each one
[Miguel Araújo - Talvez se eu dançasse (live in Porto new year's eve)]
[António Zambujo - Zorro]
Gente da minha terra by Marisa
Its a really good example of the Portuguese music style Fado, that was created by wife, mothers and sisters of Portuguese discovery man during the discoveries
Dunas by GNR & Esse olhar que era só teu by Dead Combo - > From Portugal
Basically, in Portugal, we are having a lot of different things going on
Some have referred Rodrigo Leão, which is quite alternative and well appreciated by some music niche lovers
Others refered Miguel Araújo and António Zambujo, who have been playing and mixing pop, rock, bossa nova and fado in some really catchy addictive songs
But we also have some artists, specially from Angola and Cabo-Verde (or with roots there) doing some really nice music
Madonna love these, I love these and everybody who grew up in Lisbon and Porto suburbs love these sounds mixed between our cultures
Artists like Sara Tavares, Buraka Som Sistema, Branko, Dino Santiago, Lura, Mayra Andrade, Nelson Freitas, C4Pedro have been doing some really nice tunes and conquering the tops here in Portugal
Cool guys
I found them on Spotify a few weeks ago
I kinda like a few songs from Die Prinzen
they have some nice songs
I don't listen much António Zambujo but is it really Fado
For what I listened from him I would guess he is more 'pop' than fado
Acho que a música dele é mais uma mistura entre pop, fado e bossa nova
I mean I don't know really what distinguishes Fado and everything else but it's not much different from Mariza, Ana Moura, Carminho or other fado singers nowadays
Fado doesn't have to be a sad song
this is what we call Fado Canção aka Fado song
However, when it comes to Antonio Zambujo I think we could call it Fado Fusão aka Fado Fusion because he mixes other styles with the basic Fado structure, specially MPB and Bossa Nova
Lisbon vs Porto, no doubt
One represents the south, the other represents the north
There's the rivalry in football with Sporting CP vs SL Benfica (Lisbon based clubs and rivals) vs FC Porto (Porto based club)
There's also rivalry regarding food (Francesinha is the best dish, some may say)
You also have a known rivalry between Guimarães and Braga, mostly due to football
In fact, most cities "rivalries" here are *in a way* due to football
Edit: some words and check u/laserblast28 reply
What about Portsmouth and Southampton
I've heard about Portsmouth workers going on strike and Southampton ones using the opportunity to take their jobs a hundred years back
Lisboa and Porto
Basically because of all reasons imaginable (except religion)
The capital city vs the second biggest city, also representing the north
But in the end of the day we're all portuguese
Perugia - Terni
You still find road signs with "merda" written under the opposing city's name, depending where in Umbria one is
Evora - Beja
In Evora, when you want to offend someone you say that he must be from Beja
It has nothing to do with football, it probably has to do with local economical dynamics
Yes
Common accents are African, French and German
I can't come up with specific examples, I haven't seen cartoons for a long time now
But King Julien from Madagascar has an African accent; in general, African accents belong to animal characters
In general "foreign"  human characters have a French accent, English if they are silly and German if they're the villain or a silly villain
But this is just the subconscious idea I've ingrained in my head, from my childhood
EDIT: This is sort of rare, because we usually don't dub movies/series
So it's likely I've these memories/ideas from the English (or any other language) version of cartoons
Yes they dub them with Portuguese accents
Sometimes can be racist to be honest
Like the one that comes to mind is Shrek where he has a thick northern accent
The stereotype is that northern people are wildings and dumb lol
(I'm a northener)
As far as i'm aware all animated movies and series are dubbed here in Portugal
It's the non-animated ones that usually aren't.
Noticed on the other day the werewolves from Transylvania got the accent from Alentejo region
Never watched those movies in english (just watched a couple times with my kid), but I guess they have a redneck'ish accent in the original
It kind of makes sense, being also an accent from the deep, country side
Another example for that African accent you mention is that crab from the Little Mermaid
You're younger than me then
Cartoon Network used to be entirely in English and Canal Panda was big part in Spanish, English, Japanese with subtitles
There used to be some dubbing in Brazilian Portuguese, for example, all the Disney Movies prior to the Lion King were in PT-BR
Then it gradually became more common
I'm 25 btw
We haven't started dubbing movies until fairly recently
Disney and Pixar movies (Starting with Lion King) were the first cartoons to be dubbed, I think
Before that, we mostly had subtitles
I remember growing up there where 2 cartoon channels
One of them was in English without any subtitles
We only started consistently dubbing cartoons maybe 10 years ago, or less
Movies/series are almost never dubbed
But Portuguese dubbing, when it's done, it's actually really cool and well done
The actors really pour their souls into it
DragonBall dubbings are a national treasure
Rick and Morty Netflix subtitles makes the experience 2x better
Oh yeah i remember those times too
It just seemed like you were saying that that's still the reality today
Actually when it comes to animated movies and kids movies (not necessarily animated) have always been dubbed IIRC
Disney classics from the 30s are already dubbed
If I had to guess, they probably started with that after '74 revolution, but for sure didn't start with lion king
But yeah, great work, and also usually with great, known actors
At least when it comes to the most recent ones from the past decade or so
(And yes, national treasure for sure
Bubu quer bolinho
In Portugal, we have some dialects in the region of Alentejo, in Algarve, in the North (like Porto) and in the Azores and Madeira island, altough the Azores have many dialects (almost one per island)
And also one in Setúbal
There's also a secondary language in Miranda, in the North, called Mirandês
yep, we do a LOT
Wait, in what world are Nordics strict with alcohol
For some bizarre reason, Portugal usually gets away with or are forgotten whenever a discussion about slavery and colonization comes up
Everyone tosses the blame amongst the Spanish, the English and even the Dutch, but the Portuguese usually get a pass, for some reason
Not that I - as Portuguese - am complaining, but it *is* weird
To be fair, no one talks about the [Arab slave trade] that preceded it either or the slaves that the Ottoman Empire captured from Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Ireland between the 16th and 19th centuries
There was a time when it was almost impossible to live in the Algarve because of the Barbary corsairs
I'm not defending or condoning the atrocities committed by the Portuguese during the Atlantic Slave Trade, just that everyone who was involved should be held accountable, not just one particular group or race
I've seen people claim that slavery was invented by the Romans because they saw Gladiator
From 7th to 9th grade I had ceramics/pottery classes
In my opinion it was just a huge waste of time since our school barely had adequate conditions for those classes anyway, and half of the time we just ended up drawing or something like that
And I still remember when our teacher tried to punish our entire class (for bad behavior of some people) with a written test
about pottery
Yeah
That time would be better spent elsewhere
P.S. We also have religion classes in Portugal, but they are optional subjects
If I am to take your post literally then the 5th and 6th grade subject of História e Georgrafia de Portugal, History and Geography of Portugal
pretty self explainatory
I've always wondered if others countries have a subject wholly dedicated to Descriptive Geometry
It's a two-year subject that Arts and Sciences students can do
I used to suck at it in the beginning, but thanks to a great teacher I met I finally managed to understand that it's all about knowing how different objects operate in a three-dimensional space and how to depict that in two-dimensions
It can seem tricky at first, but I still think it's the easiest subject to get a perfect grade because it's an exact science
One of my most humbling experiences was getting into an Architecture course and realizing that everyone in my class had gotten a perfect score in the Descriptive Geometry exam
We also have it in the visual arts "course" in high school (it's one of the paths you can choose from 10-12th grade, alongside humanities, science, etc); história da arte (history of art), desenho (drawing) and geometria descritiva (descriptive geometry) are all classes (mandatory, I believe) in that path
We also have mandatory Philosophy classes on High School (10th and 11th year) if you follow the traditional high school
In Portugal we also have 2 years of mandatory Philosophy classes
After those 2 years, there is an option to make the final national exam of that subject, which several people do in order to replace other exam they don't want to do like Biology or something like that
> "Interdisciplinary Proyect"
We had something like this, when I was growing up, it was called «Área de projecto». Afaik it doesn't exist anymore as of 2011 or so
The class would gather in groups and each group would make a project for each trimester (or for the whole year)
Projects could range from written papers; models/maquettes; theater plays; organizing volunteering activities in the municipality and/or school; etc
> "Education for the citizens"
We also had this, when I was growing up, it was called «Formação Cívica». I believe the name was changed nowadays, but there seems to be an equivalent subject nowadays still
We had those subjects several grades in a row, but I don't remember which ones
There was also «Estudo Acompanhado», something like "Study Hall", which was supposed to teach students studying methods, but was mostly used by teachers to cover materials they didn't manage to cover during their regular classes, at least in my experience
*Formação Cívica* and *Estudo Acompanhado* always blended together in my experience, probably because we had the same teacher for both and we'd have one class right after the other
There is a border village called Rio de Onor
But it has been split for many centuries, probably since 1298, which set the border at the river or creek which splits the village in two
Actually it split into two between Portugal and Léon, but Léon no longer exists as a country of course
They used to speak leonese there anyway
Not on the national border  (though there are cities who are very close to one another and in permanent contact, like Elvas and Badajoz), but there's some examples on the municipality level
For example, there's a little town (partly) in my municipality, Vale do Poço (literally, Well Valley) that is divided between the municipality of Mértola and that of Serpa, to the point that some houses (and the church, I think) are partly in one municipality, partly in another
Vila do Conde and Póvoa de Varzim  were once clearly separated, but they both grew enough that you don't notice the border between them
that's just a single city that doesn't get legally reclassified as such, not much different from the suburbs around Porto and Lisbon
it's not on the border with another country and doesn't answer what op asked
I misread the question
The Battle of Alcacér Quibir is one of those experiences
For Portugal its the moment of a national disaster, with our young foolish King dying with only his elderly uncle, that was also a Cardinal, as the heir and that will be the cause for the Iberian Union
Meanwhile in Morocco, according to my Professor of History of the Portuguese Empire, the battle is seen as a grand moment of national pride in which they absolutely crushed the Christian invaders that had been attacking them for almost two centuries
Oh yeah lots
Particularly indians, indians are very into nationalism, and ocasionally drop in to talk of the evils of Vasco da Gama and such or the "liberation" of Goa
> in Europe I suppose he is probably more seen as a warmonger with an inflated ego
Fucking invaded us three times, we were right here in our corner not interfering with anybody
Many years of war, and caused problems for decades afterward
Fucking asshole, rot in hell
> not interfering with anybody
I mean, we were interfering with his plan to blockade England, so
Yes
I think I actually own more home clothes than outdoor clothes
My body hasn't changed much since adolescence so I definitely wear clothes I used to wear back then as home clothes
I have clothes that I only wear at home *because they are too nice to wear out*. The public does not deserve my nicest clobber and I'm not about to risk it out there on the street
ANGOLA É NOSSA
Ours used to end with "Against the Brits we march, we march
We ended up changing Brits for cannons
Crusader kings:
Tried Portugal
err its predecessor
failed miserably, I just don't have what it takes to beat the Ummayaad blob
shame on me, so I usually go viking or somewhere around Europe and the Arab world, as they're the ones I'm more accustomed to and at least know the minnimal history about
Eu4:
Portugal caralho, the only strategy game other than civ that Portugal is an actual strong start
So yeah usually I play colonisers (including conquering Portugal as Spain
sorry ancestors) or some easy countries like Muscovy and Ottomans since I'm not that great
Victoria:
Only had the minnimal experience with the game, done US, Brazil and Portugal games
never really got to the ~~end~~midgame
Hoi4:
I suck at it, so Germany and Portugal once
only to be stuck in a civil war
Yeah I tend to go Portugal in historical strategy games when it isn't just impossible for me, biased gamer
Portugal in every single one
Also Vikings and Byzantium in CK2, Brandenburg and Byzantium in EU4, Prussia in Vic 2, and Greece in HoI4
Portugal, Portugal, Portugal, Portugal
I see a trend going on
Portugal caralho
This is OOC but I've always loved this relationship of us that ressembles siblings
We may tease and poke each other, but we'd never let another country trash talk our brother
Excluding the towns named "Saint something of somewhere", "new town of somewhere" and small 10 people villages, the longest one I can remember is "Freixo de espada à cinta", meaning "Ash-Tree with a sword at its belt". It sounds just  as ridiculous in Portuguese
Vila Real de Santo António is also a long ass name
Reguengos de Monsaraz too
And just to add salt to injury, there's a literal 500 years old ash tree with a literal, again, sword around its waste, there, take a look:
That's what I meant by omitting the "new town". That would include all the "Vila Nova"s, "Vila Franca"s and whatnot
They would still count, but I'd have to look for all of them
You're right, I didn't really read that part
Does Vila Velha de Rodão count
That video impresses me every time, the journalist nails it perfectly
I mean, all of them count, they just don't make for funny or particularly interesting names, I think
They are also harder for me to remember, because you sometimes omit them
People call it "Gaia", not "Vila Nova de Gaia".
Montemor-o-velho is also pretty neat (Great Mount, the Old), so is Venda das Raparigas (Selling of Girls)
Freixo de Espada à Cinta is still the weirdest one to me, just because it's just bizarre
Yeah it doesn't really make sense
What does "Ródão" mean tho
Happy cake day <3
Grande Roda
I don't really know
Most town names are so old and have gone through so many shifts in languages (just look all the ways "Lisboa" has been spelt from the Romans, to the Phoenicians to the Arabs and the Celts and the Barbarians
I'd say that most of the cities are named after geographical features/landmarks, or after important people
Looking through a map of Portugal over a region that you're not familiar is a great way to find words that mean nothing to you, but still somehow follow the same speech/orthographic patterns you're used to
Yeah that's cool
I think I'll go back to Lisbon (living in the UK rn) to help to restaurants and cafes that had to close down yk then somewhere in Italy (mb a less obvious city with less tourists which is prolly gonna have a harder time getting back up)
Florence, I've been spending my quarantine planning a perfect trip there <3
The art is amazing,  the cool Bridges and food
It just amazes me
Just the best city in the world ngl (totally non-biased comment)
Plovdiv is sooo beautiful
If you want to visit all the museums prepare in advance or you’ll spend most of your time waiting in line
Italy is amazing, I felt 100% at home there
I feel like Italians have a very similar culture to ours, when it comes to enjoying nice food, drinking some wine, taking your time to enjoy simple things like the nice weather and the company of your friends and family
I would recommend getting a car and visiting Castelluccio di Norcia, easily the most beautiful place I’ve ever seen in my life
>tend to stay in the way,
What do you mean with that
Thanks for the advice,  I will take it in consideration and update my travel plan
Yes that happens regularly, we still have that habbit
Same in portugal Unfortunately
even now it was approved that this year there was no money to fight the traffic in influence and large capitals
and released a president who was arrested for stealing
I have a qatari car and a chinese car in my building's garage
I saw some american license plates around here, one of them from California
Also some from the UAE and Bahrain
There also some Russian license plates around here even though they are very far from here
Japanese in Algarve and american in Porto
The american SUV made me wonder why though
Dumb question but what about the car
Arroba it hasn't a translation
Arrobas was an old Portuguese weight unit that was worth about 15 kg
Same in Portuguese
Also, @ is the symbol for that unit
And it's still used nowadays with that purpose, in agriculture, mainly in the cork industry - 1 @ = 15 kg
I'd rather die than cheer for Spain
Normally if Brazil is playing against another county portuguese people cheer for Brazil
If Portugal gets knocked out, I cheer for Germany, then Scotland, then either Ireland, and then I follow the good ol' European tradition of cheering for whoever is playing against England
Wouldn't say I cheer for them, but I like to see Japan, Australia and Korea doing well in the WC
Also small countries in general
Costa Rica in the 2014 WC for example
Spain, France, Italy, Germany, Brazil, England and Argentina can all fuck off in the Euro/WC as far as I'm concerned
Well, actually, Italy and Argentina are  the ones I have the less problems with so I don't mind much if they do well
The rest nah
China
What sports
They played in like one World Cup
That's weird
Portuguese people don't root for Spain or France ever
Italy is alright with us though
Big countries are evil and small countries are good
You're a big country so you're part of the axis of evil while someone like Czech Republic or Belgium are part of the good guys
That's how it is
You don't love us though
You don't care about us in fact
So I dunno who you're trying to fool
Ah, yes, the Mediterranean Sea
That's exactly what I'm looking at outside my window
Cold, massive waves and currents, insane tides and New York on the other side
In Austria: how early they have dinner
I'm used to dine somewhere between 8pm and 9pm
Walking around Vienna at those hours, looking for a restaurant and seeing the streets basically empty and bars filled with people just having a beer or something was weird to me
I remember partying on Halloween in Edinburgh and was shocked that the clubs closed at 4 am
Granted it wasn't a public holiday the day after as they moved those all to the Monday after I believe
Agreed on the cocaine thing
Studied for a year in Edinburgh and by the second week did some at a party
I got the feeling doing cocaine was super casual over there, whereas in Portugal it's seen as more of a hard drug
At least people were friendly enough to share some
You put water in your coffee
You see, this is why you're the black sheep of the Latin family
I can't speak for Italians, but in Portugal we do perceive American coffee as an aberration
In Portugal you ask for coffee and they give you an Espresso and that's it
The good thing about having roommates from Central and Northern Europe is that they have dinner early and you then get the kitchen all to yourself
Then an Italian joins in and it messes up your dinner-making schedule
>in Portugal we do perceive American coffee as an aberration
No we don't
They didn't even drink Americano (I agree it's an aberration), they drank a "café cheio". We have that here too, you just let more water pour out into an espresso cup
We also have "café curto". Most people here would consider either just a personal preference, and both are still very much an espresso
Yes, I've learned that recently
Apparently it's us Iberians that have dinner super late
I wonder if people in other countries use that to spot us
"These dudes eating this late must be Spanish/Portuguese".
It depends on the age
But if they are really young, they go to bed around that time as well
But in such cases, they also eat earlier
But note that little children are an exception
Ah, right
I always forget about you
\*you don't. I always heard the term "balde" (bucket) and "àgua deslavada" (unwashed water)
we do
you are just a pussy who goes to starbucks
I mean "add". Espressos are pressurised out of the machine, very strong and very concentrated
You have to mix the right kinds of coffee, in the right amount, at the right temperature
Too much water, and they might lose the smell, which is important
It's a big deal in Southern Europe
When it's [done right] it can be a cool idea, actually
> \*you don't.
My contribution is as valuable as yours
You can easily say expresso is the preferred way
But black coffee is far from being an aberration
You can see a lot of filter coffee machines, for example
Starbucks is actually quite decent compared to "real" American coffee (probably because of the obnoxious quantities of sugar)
When I was in New York I bought a coffee and I'm pretty sure they gave me a cup of boiling water instead
Jesus, starbucks is so bad
at least comparing to a good expresso
I think they just want the feeling of drinking something warm, why not drink tea instead
oh, no
Your coffee is shit, period
It can be culture and be shittt, I am sure you would hate hundred of things we call culture here
Also iced tea looks tasty
In one word
Andorra: Skiing
Liechtenstein: Posh name
Luxembourg: Portugal number 2
Monaco: Casino
San Marino: Valentina Monetta
Vatican City: Pope
I did to when I played airsoft
One of the best retailers until the Poles stepped in and took the market by assault
Just wait until our diaspora starts annexation on some part of Luxembourg ( insert Doofenshmitts evil laughter)
Almost 20% of the population of Luxembourg is Portuguese, being the biggest foreign community of the country
(But of course, economically speaking Luxembourg and Portugal are nothing alike
Ahahah
Queen Valentina is the best ambassador a small and otherwise unkown state like San Marino could have
Love her
Thanks
\*high five\*
Not again
That's how it all begins
eheh
There are a lot of versions of the story
And there are a lot of websites claiming different things and missing or adding details
So the most accurate I can give you is this one from wikipedia:
I am getting my car filled anyway
Gas prices are going up
Maybe that was the idea anyway
FFS America, there is no longer even a pretense at keeping up appearances
We're out
One world war was enough, thank you
Either :
A) we are going to have another proxy war in the middle West cause by America self interest and arrogance
B) ww3 depending if any major players get pull into this mess
C) one of the above answers plus America not suffering directly from conflict because they are far away and they already feel detached from the rest of the world, Europe gets directly affected be it by another refugee crisis (i have nothing against  refugees, I'm all in favour of letting them in, the only thing i don't like is the rise of the far right that uses the refugee crisis has a political manoeuvre to get votes and spread hate), more economical problems petrol going up even more (here in Portugal we already pay way to much in comparison to our salaries), family destroyed etc something that Europe and the EU will have to shoulder most of the consequences of america meddling and Russia (ei
Putin) is probably happy (weaking Europe, dividing the American people etc)
I don't really think Iran will strike back with a war, I mean they have no interest on it
They will, at max, probably strike back with terrorist attacks across western countries, mainly countries in Europe and the US
Amen to that
does not matter, if something becomes scarce, the price goes up for all other origins
And gas prices will go higher and higher, and many americans  and saudis I am sure will profit from higher gas prices and military contracts
Spain, they already have a plan and everything
Spain
OLIVENÇA É NOSSA
Spain
We have kind of a trauma, but it wouldn't happen, we're friends
So most likely the US
Spain will be on it for sure
Spain
Spain
again
Of course it would be
Either Brazil or Spain
Spain
Wouldn't be the first time
Good you're not expecting our padeira de aljubarrota
yes
it would be Morocco :)
"I, for one, welcome our new Spanish overlords
" - João da Ega
Amém
Venezuela would be the one who is most mad at us too
Keep them busy . while they're in you we're fine
Or France if they start acting napoleonic again
Again for the 4 time
In The Spanish civil war the republican have in the constitution annexe for portugues territory
Nobody expects the Portuguese invasion
We also have plan has counter attack its called Baker woman of Aljubarrota 2
0 aka a clone army of her truly a weapon to surpass metal gear
Franco did
He said he could do it in 24 hours
[Found it]
Do we get Ibiza and Palma in that deal
Who needs air forces when you have Padeira de Aljubarrota
Respect for the tapas, hermanos
****In Greenlander accent**** They're not for sale
Yeah, we've effectively been reducing their population by a lot
Help us, Britain
We'll let you expand Gibraltar
creeps
there is and you guys are using it
Chemical warfare is illegal
If you do that we will use our clones to destroy anything that stands with the exception of Galiza, Olivença and Catalunha
For the right price, maybe
Deal
The traditional one is the "tasca". Most houses for the poor people who came to work in the city factories during the XIX and early XX century had no cooking facilities
Instead, each neighborhood had one or more cheap restaurants where everyone would eat, drink and socialize
Some of them still exist
This concepts dates back to the Roman era though and is not exclusive to the industrial age
Nowadays most restaurants and cafes have a cheap lunch menu for a fix price where people who work nearby will go to eat
Tipically you get soup, a bread roll, one or two options for a main dish, dessert, drink and coffee for about 5€.
Every restaurant and café has a lunch-hour menu
(this got heard do to a certain event in 2016)
(this is just beautiful)

Some portuguese songs:
Deolinda - Um contra o outro
Os Golpes "Vá lá senhora com Rui Pregal da Cunha"
Humanos - Quero é viver
Taxi - Cairo
Great: pretty much anything by Valete tbh but most notably "Poder" and "Fim Da Ditadura", a philosophical and a political rap (warning for the latter if ur American)
Catchy: my (non Portuguese speaking) girlfriend favourites are 1 De Abril by Plutonio and Happy Day by Deejay Telio
For me tho, Julinho Ksd has the most catchy songs ik
My favourite PT song is actually a mix of great and catchy, Meu Deus by Plutonio
Also Alles neu
Not any accent in particular, they made him use a lot of aspotrophes to mean he mumbled words
Here's an example from Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban:
«O Conselho diretivo foi informado, claro - disse Hagrid tristíssimo
- Acham qu'eu comecei p'lo fim, que devia ter deixado os hipogrifos pra mais tarde
apresentado qualquer coisa da família dos vermes
Mas eu queria qu'a primeira lição fosse boa
Foi tudo culpa minha
In the movies (1 to 3 were dubbed in EU-PT) he has quite a rural accent from, I would say, Central Portugal
I think it suited him perfectly
In the books, however, I remember he would be speaking with a lot of apostrophes indeed, in a very countryside relaxed way
I almost forgot we dubbed the first movies
I have no idea how Hagrid sounded
What accent was it
Beira Alta
Aveiro
Beira Baixa
Ribatejo
I just know the voice actor's name is António Marques but I don't know where he is from
Regarding the accent, I just feel it might be from the Centre, I can't specify which, though
(I am not from the mainland)
He rolls the soft - r, sybillates the - s and emphasises the -e at the end of the words
Portalegre
Perhaps Covilhã?
Portalegre is not Center Portugal
by what you said that seems something like Beira Alta or Beira Baixa
My bad, I was considering Center, as in opposition to Northern accents ahah but test it yourself:you can choose the dubbed version on Netflix
Everyone: we call it X
Scandinavians: What is this “cheating”?
Classic
2) applies everywhere
During the first school years (6 to 15 yo kids) usually each class have their own classrooms , so kids bring their stuff in the begining of the day and don't need to cary them around until they go home
In high school, kids (15 to 18 yo) move to different classrooms depending on their schedules, so schools have some lockers
But are shared for more than one students, who use them to put gymnbags and heavy stuff during the day, and take that stuff with them at end off the day
I my school does have lockers, but I'd say the majority doesn't use them, at least I haven't used one in two years
I've always had lockers in my school but you would only leave your books there if you wanted
Teachers pressured us to always take them home and bring them back the next day so we would study at home after school but it was just too heavy for most of the students since we had 2 books per class
yeah but you have to pay 10 euros to use them for the year and after it ends they give you the money back, never used one as i dont need to have all of my books on me either way
Yes
In basic school (years 5-9) you had to pay 5€ in the beginning of the year in case you ended up damaging your locker
If you didn't, then they would give you back the 5€ at the end of the school year
They were usually shared between 2 students
However, in secondary school (years 10-12) you actually just had to pay 5€, or 2,5€ if you had school help, and they would not pay you back
Because of that, barely anyone had them
They didn't /have/ to share like in basic, but people who had lockers ended up sharing with all their friends anyway, so sometimes you had over 5 people sharing the same locker
In my high school and in my uni we do have lockers but they’re not a lot and very few people ask for one
We didn't have lockers in my school
Everyone just dropped their bags around the corridors
Now that I think about it, it's kind of crazy things didn't get stollen
I used to move around to different classrooms a lot in years 5 through 9 (9-15 yo), we had lockers that we shared with a classmate
I remember that despite we have (shared) lockers, we leave the key in the door lock
In the end they are only unlocked cabinets
For us 10^6 is milhão and 10^12 is bilião. 10^9, the English language "billion", doesn't have its own name in Portuguese, we just say "mil milhões", i.e. "a thousand millions".
Millions is "milhões". Billions is "mil milhões" (thousand millions)
Trillions is "biliões
". Quadrilllions is "mil biliões" (thousand trillions)
In Brazil they just use "milhões", "bilhões", "trilhões" e "quadrilhões", and God do I hope that picks up here, literal French tier numbering
There's [Mary King's Close] in Edinburgh
It's like an underground city
In downtown Lisbon there are [galleries from the Roman Empire] They're considered a *cryptoporticus*, a structure built to support the cities buildings, as the soils weren't very consistent
They are usually flooded, but once a year they pump the water out, and people can sign up to visit
There's also a [XVIII century 32km network] of tunnels built to deliver drinkable water across the city
My home town, Caldas da Rainha, is known for it's thermal waters and they were the reason for the city's estabilishment
As such, what is probably the oldest thermal hospital in world was built, and with it a series of underground tunnels to take the water from the water deposits and aquifers to the hospital
[There are above ground entries with stairs to the tunnels] but they're not advisable to explore if you're claustrophobic
These are the ones I know about
There's probably more around the country
Yes
Hey were left by the Romans and are now a museum you can visit
Not really a catacomb like in Paris, but in Porto there is a highly complex system of tunnels bellow the older parts of the city
Only a few parts are visitable (with proper permission), and those are mostly modern (ie
less than 200 years old)
The majority of the tunnel network is either inaccessible, unmapped or dangerous
We have underground streams and water canals, sewage systems dating back to roman times, and even a small river that has been completely covered for centuries
There is also an old closed railway tunnel that crosses through a big chunk of the city, several tunnels with military purposes made in the XVIII and XIX centuries and plenty of tunnels spanning through seemingly random points of the city, built to connect long gone industries and other points of interest that are no longer there
During my engineering studies I met several people who were involved in building our subway system and they talked about how they had to deal with unexpected tunnels quite often and add new drainage solutions because of it
Number of codfish recipes per capita
Portuguese is the only language in Europe that has ã õ and the sound of ão (if I'm not mistaken)
Adventuring the seven seas is our blood, we eat a lot of fish dishes even almost rivaling Japan on fish eaten, we eat a lot and i mean lot of fish, we gave the Japanese tempura (its a Portuguese dish that Japanese adapted, we still eat it)
We have one of the best drug policy in Europe and the world, and plus its unique at the time it was made, being the first country to discriminalise the consumption of all drugs
We are that western most part in Europe, Lisbon is one of oldest cities in Europe and survive catastrophic destruction (just search Lisbon earthquake 1755, which was a massive earthquake plus a massive fire and a tsunami), the tenplare order survived here in Portugal (tldr when the church started kill, and take away the property of the tenplare order, the King of Portugal decided to protect them, so he created a new order and the old members plus property and symbol were transferred to that new order, it became the order of christ; btw the head of state is granted the title of grand master of the order, BTW is heavily associated with Portugal is the symbol of the order
In the southern part Portugal we have an Arabe style of buildings and houses
We have word called "saudades" it translation is missing (has in some place or someone) but the word it self has context behind it, an emotional meaning that's impossible to translate 1:1 with any other word, the emotional context that this word has is a very strong feelings of depression sadness melancholy the feelings that you are going crazy a endless lounging of home or someone (its hard to explain it)
We have one of biggest eez in Europe
We had a peaceful revolution that ended a fascist regime in 1974 April 25th
We have a music style called fado, it's really beautiful and unique, (search on YouTube for Amália Rodrigues, give a listen for a few songs you may like it)
We had a poete that had 70ish multiple personalities, he had 3 main one and one who was a semi personality (has he described it) they were heteronyms and wrote in different styles etc (search Fernando Pessoa, it's going to be a fun trip down the rabbit hole of learning about him)
We love Cork wood, we make a lot of things with Cork, we are the biggest producers of Cork wood in the world, most bottles corks in circulation are Portuguese, we have Cork shoes, Cork wallets etc
We are also one of if not the biggest producers of paper in the world (if I'm not mistaken)
Port wine, Pastéis de nata and cork
Its shaped like a rectangle
Wine and forest
And a big fucking diference betwen coastal cities (mainly Lisbon, Porto, and probaly Algarve) and the rest of the country
Its depressing how expensive things are there
The sea
Algarve
Tourism
Thats one way to look at it
Hey, that's our thing too
Wait what
3 presidents
Is that a normal constitucional situation or abnormal one
That seems a little weird, no offence, i don't much about you guy, could you please explain the situation with that I'm a bit curious to know how and why, also sorry if this is to many questions
West*
Uhh thanks for the explanation
That's kind of unique and interesting case, is divide cause by ethnic or religious reasons or both
That's probably because of the fonectic sounds, it's like when i hear Russian, Portuguese and Russian don't share anything with each other has languages, they are separated geographically pretty far and yet they use some phonetic sound similar to some of the ones we use
It's really strange but if I'm not paying attention it sounds like Portuguese has long i don't listen to the words
Granted i only heard Russian on videos online but still
Why not try to higher the standard in education and in social interventions, you know the better a population is educated normally the less prejudice they might have towards others
And then possibly in the future make the political tension go down and maybe adopt a new political form
Sad to hear, hope the situation get better in the future
No, at least not in Porto
I also remember when I came back to Portugal from living a few months in Belgium I had to unteach myself to greet the driver when I went in
We also leave the bus through the back door, so it wouldn't work
Not in London but in Colchester it seem to be so
I have a friend who always says good morning/afternoon to the bus driver and they say the same back to her
It's uncommon, but there's nothing wrong with that
Yeah but it doesn't feel as normal, we do it less
I just felt drivers weren't expecting it
I like Portugal's, especially because it makes it look like Spain's missing something
France also has a nice shape
Square country
Australia
It kind of looks like a dolphin
Portugal looks like a face in profile
We look like a chicken nugget sooooo yeah we win
No love for square Portuguese boys
It’s a rectangle
We do have peninsulas
Check península de setúbal
And we have islands too: archipelagos of madeira and azores
We also have lots of ocean for ourselves
Turkey should be expelled from NATO and never get a chance of joining the EU
Portugal should have a firm stance against this
But that would be against the ages old strategy of Portuguese diplomacy: Keep as quiet as possible and then join the side that already won
You mean this mission  ?
Because they are clearly talking about the Patriot anti missile battery
That doesn't actively help anyone kill anyone
That strategy came when the republic was formed
The accent
When I was in London or usa the accents are literally like the ones in the movies while non natives are just like mine hahaha but something you fail ofc
You can definitely tell, mostly due to the accent
I can even tell almost immediately when someone is portuguese only by listening to their english accent
As most everyone is telling you, yes, it is easy to tell native speakers from non-native
That reminds me of a funny thing
Some years ago it was news here in Portugal that the British intelligence services discovered that a Portuguese man joined ISIS and was in Syria or Iraq (I don't remember which)
Then a clip was shown of him wearing a mask to cover his face and saying something in English
It was funny to me because it was immediately obvious that he was Portuguese, the thick tuga accent was unmistakable
Some nordics have a very good english accent but there's always something there that makes you pick up on in
Mostly I can identify native speakers yeah
In Portugal we can, specially when they try pronouncing -lhe, -ão, -ãe, and other types of uncommon sounds
Same I love to try to figure out from where in Europe people are from based on their accent while speaking english
the letter J is read like "ee" on several Germanic and Slavic languages
"Y" is read sometimes as "ai", I said "ee" as it's less confusing
In Portugal you actually hit the boot (bate a bota)
Kinda similar to the english "kick the bucket".
We also have "esticar o pernil" (stretch the leg
in my opinion we have a few:
1)pastry -
our nuns created several pastry recipes that are just delicious
The basics are always the same: eggs, sugar and flour, but the result of it's always divine
2)1001 recipes for dried codfish -
from raw to roasted codfish each and everyone has a different way of cooking codfish
and all of them are pretty amazing
3)cultural influences from our colonies -
its undeniable that we had colonies until 1970s. But even today we still have a somewhat close relationship with them
And that can be seen in fashion, music and food, of course
A true Portuguese watches Brazilian soap operas, dance African kizomba and is still discovering these amazing food flavors
4)bad TV -
due to lack of investment in good quality shows, our TV programing kinda sucks
We have one or two good TV shows but those  usually are adaptations from other European countries, specially adaptations from Spain
5) football is a religion -
and Cristiano Ronaldo is god
We are the best ones cooking cod (bacalhau) in the World
We have lots of ways of making cod and all of them are delicious
Wtf i thought my family was the only one with such mealtimes lmao
Hello fellow member of the poetry club
I believe numbers were counted that way in English in the past
Of course I'm just basing this off of the prose in A Song of Ice and Fire, which is meant to be a little archaic
For instance, there's a phrase often repeated in the books which is "I am looking for a maid of three-and-ten
for us it's the German team
we all have a kriptonite
we don't do siesta anymore
Well, the pride we have in our cod recipes is rather unique then
There are like 1001 recipes of cod fish here
Not subjective
Portugal is not the biggest producer of cod fish since we import it, but we are the biggest consumers (both per capita and by volume if I'm not mistaken)
I know that we are the largest producers of cork in the World, but that is the kind of thing we know from primary school
And I know most of the cod we cook comes from either norway or iceland
But the pride we have on our cod dishes is much bigger
And still trust me, no one cooks cod like us
It might seem subjective until you come here and prove it
"A football game is eleven vs eleven, and in the end Germany wins
O futebol è onze contra onze, e no fim ganha a Alemanha
There is a book named "1000 Receitas de Bacalhau" (1000 Codfish Recipes) that literally has 1000 different recipes of codfish
It is published by Girassol
I just checked it and here in Portugal it is selling for around 15€.
Besides that, many portuguese cooking sites have a catalogue of free recipes (although not having 1000 recipes)
Some of these are teleculinaria
pt and tudoreceitas
com
pingodoce
pt is the site of a supermarket, but they also have some pretty cool recipes
I honestly don't know if you can find them in English, but translating should give you decent results, and if you want you can ask me for help
Just search "receita bacalhau" and it should give you more options than you can try in a lifetime (websites that end in .br are Brasilian ones and I honestly don't know if they cook cod like Portugal or not)
If you want a national favorite one search “bacalhau com natas” it is sooo delicious
It really is
You should definitely try it :)
Let me just state that I don't really listen to Portuguese music
But apart from the pop songs that blow up, last for 2 weeks and disappear without a trace, Portugal has quite the big jazz scene
Without knowing too much, I'd say [Tiago Bettencourt] because everyone seems to talk a lot about him and he is always recommended on YouTube in "popular in Portugal". Also pretty much anything the [siblings Sobral] (from the Eurovision song contest) do seems to blow up
Maybe someone else can add more things to this comment
Although we do have some jazz scene the top 50 songs are all either Rap or Pop songs right now
Not counting the 40 Brazilian songs on top 50 which are still sung in Portuguese but are not made in Portugal
Amadora, it is our Detroit
Olivença. It's Portuguese but somehow under Spanish rule
Hahahah
Passa a carteira comparça
What's weird about it
Caralho vou fugir
Ah Skane the the Californiaof Sweden, but in this case instead of sawing it off and pushing it towards the sea they just push it towards Denmark by themselves
Wish you luck boys
now mind you, this is not a caricature
[Agostinho Figueira, Madeira Legend]
[Secret Story stars here] also attempt to launch a singing career after the show
"Ven a bailar", she says as she's making weird moves with her body in front of a green screen
I was here thinking Maria Leal was the worst
guess I was wrong
Ahahaha
I haven't seen this for ages
Mano nem te atrevas a insultar o deus musical Zé Cabra que nos abençoou com clássicos como "Deixei tudo por ela" etc
Also leaving this gem here ️
Zé Cabra may not be a caricature but there's enough self-awareness that it's considered a joke act
Maria Leal is more dubious in that regard
Or that "stylish" dude that was a meme a couple of months ago with with the fireworks, what's his name
This is lovely
&#x200B;
Btw
I'll share my shame:  [
filled with good music
I'm not sure I get your point
Surely [this] is considered a masterpiece
There is another
Oh god I almost forgot about him  Jorge Martinez
Fucking authoritarians
30 cm walls, can't get more European with cm
It's pretty good ngl
The best thing about it is that you can easily do that Halo song meme with the anthem yk
I honestly think our anthem (Portuguese anthem) is the best, and I’m not even that patriotic it’s just it honestly sounds good and gets me hyped up, and besides that it’s easy to sing (looking at you US), but I have to admit the lyrics are pretty similar to other national anthems but I don’t look too far into that
Heróis do mar, nobre poOooOoovo
You can also use it as a battle cry
It's extremely good to sing screaming, sends shivers down my spine
I like it
I've heard some European group wanted to change it a few decades ago because it's "too belligerent", but got a resounding "NO".
Probably like 6-7
Golden, Fuji, Green and Reineta (brown)
-Regional ones
-Red red
-Red yellow
-Red green
-Green
-Yellow
-Yellow green
-Brown
I have one too and some people have it in Portugal (primarily in the south)
I wouldn't call them "common", but we have cheese slicers here as well
Oh man, I always sort of assumed it was related to the Portuguese "palha", as in hay/straw because the food is yellow and it would be sustaining to simpler folk (like hay for donkeys) in a jokey way
Same law here
True civilizations have bidets
Since we're also talking about other languages, Spanish people (except Catalan speakers) sound like they have a lisp to all Portuguese speakers
thats adorable :)
Sure, but the English language has the 'th' sound, but I don't think of Mike Tyson every time I hear someone speaking English
The -y suffix also applies: John -> Johny; Dog -> doggy
Also the -let one, but that's less used
Compared to romance languages, English is so telegraphic
In Portuguese at least you can have a whole sentence spread across several lines, just using commas and connectors
Granted, it becomes convoluted after the seventh or eight line, but it's definitely not uncommon to see
This is true for Portuguese too
Make (fazer sexo)
But between the millions of expressions readily available, I prefer the beautifully worded *Esticar as peles à gaita* - literally "to strech the skins of the horn"
no one really says let's go and (make) fazer sexo
most of the times is dar (have/give) uma queca/foda
I think mostly just as a flower
Poppy seeds are a bit of a thing on fancy breads, but I'd say the vast majority of people haven't tried them
This doesn't happen in Portugal but I just have to say that  this is so interesting
Probably the game of "P" changing all the consonants with "P" in Portugal and probably other countries that speak portuguese, is a really known one (I don't know if any other country has it) but its like:
"O Papo Pueu a Poppa pa Pappapa po Pei pa Puppia"
This frase is from a tongue twister in portuguese
"O Rato Roeu a Rolha da Garrafa do Rei da Russia"
That translated means:
"The Rat/Mouse Chewed the Cork from the Bottle of the King of Russia"
Same in Portugal, but we call it "língua dos pês" ("P language")
You even managed to pick an example sentence that's exactly the same in Portuguese
I would change the events from 1910 to 1926, instead of the first Republic being disaster in terms of political and economic and social issues that lead to dictatorship
I would change it so that a far more united and moderate progressive republican party lead the county avoiding the political economic and social instability and having a consistent position towards the army fighting in ww1 instead of abandoning them, this way avoiding the collapsing of the first Republic/the beginning of the dictatorship
In this timeline because the first Republic didn't collapse and fascism never took over, Portugal developes economically and socially, the people have access to education and become well informed and capable, Portugal still becomes a mostly neutral party in ww2 do to needed balance that was crucial for the allies forces, in 1950/60s a reform would occur to end the Portuguese empire, do to internal and international pressure, either by freeing the colonies out right or by a form of temporary federalism that would result in the total transfer of sovereignty to elected officials of those regions, avoiding a colonial war, this would result in the end of the first Republic and beginning of the second Republic with a new constitution more modern in essence similar to the current one
More recently would be colonial war
Most of the european countries ended colonization after the 2nd WW and despite this fact, out country (our dictator) decided to start a war with colonized countries just because on his mind, "Angola is ours" (as well as the other African countries such as Mozambique or Cabo Verde)
Nah because we have a stronger and far older national identity we would sooner or later recuperated our total sovereignty and get out of the Royal union
Plus kicking Spaniard is our national past time, and the Aljubarrota Baker woman is the best at it (this last part is a joke, sorry XP )
the whole archetype of strangers and good and evil and all that, no
It is weird
This has been too densely populated for much longer to be places outside law and order
But the cowboy as an itinerant worker which herds cows on horseback,  we got campinos, who I expect might be kind of related to the ancestor of the cowboy give some centuries and an ocean in the middle
People practicing transumance  driving massive herds (of sheeo) across hundreds of thousands of kilometers  twice a year is a very very OLD thing, at least 2000 years old in these parts if not older than that but we got no records
Also I think very traditional in the alps and other parts of Europe
True for Portugal as well, although I think the Portuguese Adventurer exploring exotic lands has outclassed even the Knight
I wonder about the Spanish Conquistador
I don't want this to sound bad but, apart from the historic significance, we couldn't care less
It was not our war, we were busy selling tungsten to both sides and lending airports on small Atlantic islands
Much like many other historically significant moments in history east of Germany and Austria, like the breakup of Poland-Lithuania, the Great Northern War or like the Crimean War are glossed over in regular history classes
Most people have probably never heard of any of them
Yeah, I think fascists were a prime Iberian product, back then, much like olives and an overabundance of English expats are nowadays
The minium wages of places like Spain but still maintaining the same life expenses, Germany ability to have surpluses and the special roads without the speed limit (I'm speed
American Research and Development, capitalist mentality

More rain, particularly rain in summer
Really, that would be it, thanks
Swiss salaries and fondue
I was thinking about the same thing
I was going to suggest Germany and Switzerland
I mean it's good and all, but then people accuse us of being lazy, so
Plus I think the relaxed lifestyle is somewhat related to weather
If you're good at dealing with forest fires
Everyone in Portugal thinks they are Senna
According to our European neighbours we drive on the road and highways like rally drivers, to be honest they aren't wrong
Still it would be cool to see and push your car to its limits, i guess
Do you live in Portugal
Because drought and forest fires are much bigger concerns to me than raining a bit in summer
Basically Swiss salaries with Portuguese prices, but I'll guess I'll keep dreaming
I get it, taking something like a John Cooper Works Mini through Caramulo is something I would be down for
To everyone calling us lazy, I just dare them to work on 30+C° for 1/2 or even 3 months if the year
That usually does the trick
Plus, in Portugal, don't expect much air conditioner
We have way more than enough sunshine in summer so that we can spare a few for a little more rain
Everything turns green and nice smelling afterwards anyway
Being without the sun for many days in a row yes it can be depressing but it is not like you can only have opposites
I would just like the dial to a bit more rain
Also I do not know what you are like in Greece but that is very surprising
In winter we enjoy the sun, but the moment the sun turns to turn strong, we are all about walking on the shady street, parking in the shade, wear an hat, close the shutters, the sun is going to fade your curtains, your carpets, your washing
Nobody actually likes 40 degrees weather
You talk to anybody in the countryside and they talk approvingly of a "chuvinha" when it happens
You sure
I read somewhere Ireland was one country which did not have a lot of water reservoirs and had drought vulnerability
In fact I have been to gardens and parks in Ireland, you guys are on cheat mode, it is ridiculous, and whatever I looked there was no watering infrastructure
You all are cheating at gardening though
Rain is much nicer, fills reservoirs, improves environmental conditions of rivers, waters crops, washes dust, puts down fires and wets possible kindling
To each their own, I would like more rain in summer in Portugal
No, we just let the trees burn and no one correcly replant
Its sad
I wish
We can't even convince the entire population that corruption is really bad and we should take extreme measures against it much less plant trees
Not on TV but a movement started on social media and on the 22nd of September there'll be a big movement to clean the beaches, forests and all that
which causes even more fires, yes
No, eucalypts are good to make paper i think, so its a way to make money to the govern
It would be the [licor beirão] It is the most consumed liquor in Portugal at the moment
It has a sweet and aromatic taste
O que é que se bebe aqui
Either that or aguardente
The one with the best name is: licor de merda, for sure
(literally translated to: *shit liquor)*
That or Ginjinha de Óbidos
Eau de vie de poire williams is great
And I bet you can't say it right lol
Just have some Beirão, you'll get it right
Say 'sound' without the 's' or 'd' sounds
Depends
Compared to spanish
sure
As a language, per se
No, not really
I don't.
Nope, Portuguese on the other hand, is a pain in the ass
I agree that English is on the easy side
But it does have one difficulty and it's not any grammar rule, it's the large number of exceptions
I wouldn't say so, if you were like me as kid who watched all sorts of english stuff on TV and games
I'm English and live in Portugal
When I talk to my friends here about language they all say that English is easier to learn than Portuguese, but I think Portuguese has an easier structure than English because most things are *regular*. Sure there are some exceptions, but in English exceptions are the rule and every bloody verb is conjugated in a completely different way
I learned Turkish some years ago and although the vocabulary was very difficult to learn the structure of the language was a cake walk because everything was as regular as clockwork
There was no irregularity, no exceptions to the rules
With a dictionary and a basic understanding of how to conjugate and make noun cases there was nothing you couldn't communicate
I've studied both languages in uni and Spanish is definitely harder than English
The grammar is much more complex and there are a lot of false sister words
Of course it might be easier to speak to a Spanish person, but to actually talk in Spanish and not in Portunhol is very complex
The similarities between Portuguese and Spanish is what makes you struggle while learning the language
On the other hand, English is super easy
First, here in Portugal we are exposed to a lot of English (movies, music, etc)
Secondly, it is the first foreign language most of us learn
And also the grammar of the English language is so simple, is even easier than learning our own grammar
>six possible future tenses separated solely by semantics and nearly untranslatable from my native to English/vice versa
On the plus side, you only need to understand their usage, and not memorize 6 different forms of the verb for each person for each tense
I appreciate your sentiment and I do agree a bit on how people come across as arrogant - and I'm just personally about to fall into that hole - but I don't fully agree with you when it comes to differences you list
Yes, English has all those features that are tricky to learn, and some seem indeed unique to English, like phrasal verbs and the weird orthography, but all the other things
All other languages have them as well
There's slang, there's also prepositions that change whole meanings, there are words that mean different things in different dialects, a need to learn the cultural background, to understand politeness levels and different registers
every single language has those as well
You say there's more tenses in English than in German, but that becomes a moot point if then English only has a total of what, 4 different variations of each verb
(I'm thinking of "speak, speaks, spoke, spoken", for instance
Are there more ways the verb can be changed
So when people say English is easier is because on top of all those things, other languages also have other complicated features, like a vast number of cases, complicated verb conjugation, gendered words, diacritics
In my opinion, it's not just about the exposure, which I agree, is a massive factor in learning English and takes years off the learning process (and skews the view of everyone when it comes to this debate)
The inherent nature and structure of English itself makes for an easier learning curve, compared to other languages
Yup
Most portuguese can fudge some amount of functional spanish, without any kind of formal education in the language
You can't really do that for english, not to the same extent at least
Never might be a strong word but there a really strange thing that happens when fines or regulations are imposed on US companies
There are always a bunch of people seemingly angry that a government tries to limit the power of private companies and it is so fucking odd
Like, who are these people that feel the need to jump in defence of mega corps that have zero interest in anything besides maximizing profits
People not specifying which country they're talking about and assuming everyone knows which one it is

Assuming Portugal is part of Spain or that we were part of Spain that achieved independence, even though Portugal is older and more unified than Spain and we beaten in wars multiple times having a Portuguese soldier to 5 or 10 Spaniards
Or that its crazy such a small country exists being next to a larger country
Or saying some bullish about left and right wings and comparing every thing to America politics, or not understanding the meaning of the word socialist and automatically bringing one type of socialist even though the word has multiple definitions and applications in political compass and confusing social democracy with socialist or democracy with Republic or any variation of the other, associating health care with communism, hating regulations on private business
Oh and asking if in X country is weed legal, like Portugal for example, just because we don't arrest base on consumption and porting small grams of weed for self use doesn't mean its OK to bring 10kg of weed with you in Portugal
>Toilet or WC instead of bathroom
That might be one the ones that weirded me out the most recently
I had no idea that WC wasn't a global term
"Do you even have the internet
But the thing is not about having a gun, it's the cult like following that they seem to have
I grew up in a rural area and hunting rifles are really common and they are more than enough to scare someone away
No one would fashion their personality around being a a gun owner, it's a tool like a bucket or a wheel cart
We gotta worry about something on the international stage
Not insecurity, just annoyed its like the over used joke about the French waving a white flag while surrendering, it's annoying and boring the stupidity of some people
But they are racialized anyway
I couldn't find the thread (it was one of those askreddit about between diferences between Europe and the US) so here is something I found in the top search on google:
"WC (meaning 'water closet') is something that I only ever saw in Europe
It is the only one of all the ones that you mentioned that would probably confuse a person in the United States
Of those, the ones that are common around here are bathroom and restroom
Yes because they are facts and historical information that explains the context of existence of our countries my friend, you can't explain why Portugal borders are the most consistent and oldest of Europe without explaining historical facts
I mean that even if they're not part of distinct ethnic group (as Islam is made up of practically people of all colours and shapes) the concept of "Muslim" is treated as an homogenous form of a religious fundamentalist
She existed, and she did kill Spanish soldiers but not that many, that an exaggeration
Also its a fact that Portugal with a smaller army was capable to defend and defeat Spanish forces
Anyone that tells you about the Baker woman of Aljubarrota story is either telling the story or joking or baiting Spaniards to troll
Varsóvia - Warsaw is the biggest one that comes to mind
The most different ones i can remember are:
Warsaw - Varsóvia
Krakow - Cracóvia
The Hague - Haia
Beijing - Pequim
Cape Town - Cidade do Cabo
Bethlehem - Belém
Apart from these i think they're all kind of similar to the English version or at least easily recognizable
I know this is a nitpick, but the Anglosphere tends to say "Port wine" to refer to wine from Porto, but then refer to the city as Oporto
So that city has two names depending on what you're referring to, and neither one is Porto, a word that isn't even that weird in the English language
( english - portuguese);
Venice - Veneza;
Stockholm - Estocolmo;
Warsaw - Varsóvia;
(not a city but) Scotland - Escócia;
Michigan - Michigão (never seen it being used, but it shows up on wikipedia, we just say Michigan)
In Portuguese it's Florença. Interesting how the English name is more similar to Portuguese than the Italian one is
Also Beijing -> Pequim
Guangzhou - Cantão also
On reverse, the only one that is midly irritating is foreginers referring to Porto as Oporto
Also Mechelen/Malines and Derdermonde/Termonde
In Portugal I think we just use Google Maps or Waze
I wish we had something like that
I know the question it's not for me, either way, in Portugal, most of the time we just refer to UK as England  and people from UK as English
Great Britain is supposed the name of the bigger island
All 3 of those countries have little islands that aren't part of Great Britain
But this is a pedantic distinction, so I would guess everyone ignores it
1€ a beer
10€ full good meal with dessert and drink
100€ a plane ticket to the Azores :)
1€ - a kg of bananas
10€ - 16 banana flavored liquid 20cl yogurt bottles
100€ - a maximum premium one Saturday to Sunday night stay at the Parque das Nações Ibis Motel
I can confirm this
It's cheaper than in Portugal
You find that strange
Went to Turkey some 17 years ago, before they cut 6 zeros to their liras
Thought about trading some pocket money for the week and gave the guy 350 Euros
Got in exchange 420
000
000 lira, mostly in 10 and 20 million notes
Enough to say that I got all my pockets stuffed with banknotes
At that time you could  have a pretty decent lunch at the grand bazar, for around 5M.
A draft beer (20cl) in bars
The prices rise a bit in more touristic places, the medium is around 1,50€. The pints (0,50cl) cost around 4€ in touristic places, though you can get them at 3€/2,50€ in some places
Bottled beer is around 1,70€/l in stores, we have 20, 25 and 33cl bottles
The prices rise in bars, and the nicer view you have, the higher they are (as the drafted beer)
The 1l bottles are even cheaper, but they aren't sold in bars
In a Lisbon restaurant not really
1€ beer and 10€ meal on a plane still not possible
To you and u/normanbombardini here's a [site ] that compares beer prices in the biggest supermarket chains
It's updated regularly
Also, watch out for some tourist traps and ask for "cerveja" and not "beer". Sometimes the menu will state sth like *beer - 2€* and *cerveja - 1€*. They're the same but more expensive to the tourist who doesn't know what a "cerveja" is
I only learned cursive and that's what I had to use in Primary School
After that, they didn't care what we used
I eventually ended up doing a mix where I write print-like capital letters and use cursive for most lowercase letters
We're taught to write in cursive
I learned cursive in elementary, but changed to print on my own in middle school because my cursive wasn't legible and, believe it or not, I'm faster righting in print than in cursive
I don't think there is this obsession with handwriting style here in Portugal
Teachers don't really care if you use cursive or print, they just want to be able to read it comfortably
I learned cursive, but I hated it so much and had  trouble writing some letters (I even had a friend of mine drawing the  letter **E** for me) that I  taught myself how to draw printed-like letters when my dumb ass bitch  primary school teacher stopped calling me out for not writing the way  she wanted me to
Now my handwriting is computer-like, except for the  letter **a**. I must also  mention that I am and always have been terrible at arts in general, so  drawing letters in cursive was a challenge for me as a kid
Cursive exclusively untill 5th grade
After that, as long as it was readable, you could write as you wished
Same here in Portugal
There are a few pickpockets on busy streets and public transport that tourists usually take, so always keep your bags closed and in sight
Also, if you're in a bar/restaurant with outside seating area, don't leave your belongings (phones, wallets, etc) on the table
There are groups where woman casually pass by, steal your stuff and immediately give them to an accomplice
By the time you notice your stuff is gone, the woman have nothing on them and it's too late
Just don't buy any drugs from creepy dudes offering them in the streets in the center of Lisbon
They say it's good hash, but it is just dried bay leaf
Tourists, mainly first world tourists have heard something about Portuguese drug laws
Thor think drugs are yay legal
And a surprisingly amount of them are looking precisely for that
And they think nothing is strange if they are offered cannabis or cocaine for sale right on main street with plenty of people around
Suckers
I honestly had the best paella ever that lasted us for 6 meals, only for 10€, in a restaurant very near a main square
I still have no idea how we got so lucky
Granted, this was 10 years ago, might be different now
There was also that scandal a few years ago when a restaurant would give you the menu, you chooses something and they would say something like "oh we don't have that at the moment but I'd recommend *insert something that doesn't appear in the menu*". Then when you received the check it was a shit load of money
Hmmm
Portuguese here, so, I don't any issue with it
I mean Codfish is better, but Octopus, squid, cuttlefish are also quite tasty options
Take that, Cthulhu
You would not win against us, we could cook you
It is our traditional Christmas supper, for a lot of the country anyway
Americans are weird
I am going to add to the list though Hungarians which when served dishes garnished with (huge) prawns freaked out
Completely normal
Did not even occur to me that it would be a weird thing until I shocked my ukrainian in-laws
I just understand my mother in law going quietly in russian "why tf has martcapt cooked an octupus
The fuck
", or something similar
They wound up liking it though
I think they also liked the idea of coming back home with an exotic story, the same way if you ate idk a seal or something
That's beautiful
I had an aunt that did it that way
Lived food
That is a line I'm really not interested to cross
So, nope, big time Nope
Calimari is not an octopus is a squid
There are multiple british people here confusing the two I have no idea why
> hate the consistency,
It might be badly cooked
If improperly cooked it is rubbery, stretchy, nope
If it is properly cooked it is basically melt in your mouth stuff
You have to properly cook it
Then you let it go cold and make a salad with olive oil, vinegar, parsley and a small pinch of salt and pepper
If you must you can have paprika too, but I find it unnecessary
Eat it with good Alentejano bread and red wine
what's finland
Nah, I'm happy where I am
I think the US has some good things and some bad things, just like any country, but I personally don't see anything that drives me to it
If I absolutely had to move, though, I'd rather move to another European country than to the US (even though I have some family there and could easily get citizenship)
I just don't see it as the Best Country In The World as many Americans do
It's just a country and there are enough negative things about it (IMO, of course) to make it not be on the top of the list of countries I'd move to if I absolutely had to
No, there's at least 15 other countries I would choose over the US
I wouldn't really like to live in that mess of country tbh
I think that if I had move overseas I would probably choose either Canadá or Australia
No, because i live in a country with better standers of living, i have healthcare, safe, better drug policy, i have more freedom than most us citizens, access to a better and cheaper education
And better food from a taste and health perspective
I would like visiting the US but not living, fuck that, that's way too dangerous and expensive
First of all, I can't imagine living abroad
Second, I can't imagine living outside of Europe
As for the US of A in specific, I don't think I could live there, no
Too different from Europe and I doubt I'd adjust well to it
Also, I can't drive and have no desire to learn how to, so there's no way I could live in a country where you need a car to do stuff outside other than taking out the trash
I don't feel safe in a country where having firearms is allowed yet they don't have free healthcare
Portugal might be an indebted shithole right now but I wouldn't trade my free healthcare and gun control for anything
Yes i would, i like the techs there ans good universities
Interesting that you'd choose Canada but not the US
Both countries seem similar in a lot of ways (though by no means the same, before all the Canadians come at me)
I feel the same way though, I'd sooner live in most Europe, NZ, Australia, SK, Japan and Canada over the US, unless I got a great job offer there that I couldn't deny
Good points
Everyone is talking about healthcare and guns and forgetting about their military fetish and the awful imperial system
BuT wE PAy LOwEr tAxEs
I can't understand why they think like that, they still have the same mentality that they had during the American revolution for independence when it comes to someone governing the land
they don't trust the government and think its always plotting something against the American people
Great point
I just changed my mind, I'm not only going to the US, I'm also dying there yay
And Portugal is still way nicer to live in anyways, your point
... Funny someone that live in portugal saying that
Wtf
How us had a nazi/commie regime
I'm doing a parody of their arguments with "BUt We PaY LoWeR tAxEs" . But yes they spend more and have less protection in comparison
Your lack of trust is not proportional, you guys have a really radical mistrust
And the thing is, having mistrust of the government is fine, because of who is in office and their decision, but you guys turn that mistrust 10000%, hell lot of the retoric that tries to justifies having access to arms on a near military status (by civilians) is built apon that mistrust even the constitucion suggest that idea
First of all, I'm not the population of Portugal, I'm a Portuguese individual
Second, there's a different between feeling not heard and saying it and acting on that belief, a subjective belief
Third the study you are probably referring bases it's conclusions only 2 primary question (and a few other secondary questions, I'm not totally sure), and study ignores culture and historical context, 40 years ago we had fascist state that rule for 40 years and that left scares, we still have old people and even middle age people that believe that Salazar (the fascist ruler) was a good politician and he was a better ruler (the same guy that had a concentration camp for prisoners of consciousness, the same guy that didn't invest health care and that regress the country and its culture) , we have really recent Democratic and republican roots compared to most States in that study (50 countries)
In the US you have people and movements actively saying to people to buy guns base on the belief that the government is going to take their rights and make the American people slave to the government, in Portugal we don't have nothing like that
There's a different in believing and actual facts
I live in portugal
I know these things
I lived in us too, you already lived in us
Us is safer than Ukraine in homicide rate but ok
And
That has nothing to do with the argument or that study
Anwser me
You already lived in US
Or you just talking bulshitt thar you read in the internet
? But gun violence is included in homicide rate
Again this has nothing to do with the argument, i don't need to live there to know that people like that exist, hell there are people in the US that believe in Alex jones, you can ask most libertarians if they trust the government and answer is will be most likely no, they also say taxes are legalise theft by the government
I don't need to be fiscally there to know the political discore because video evidence exists of such beliefs, i don't just read news or reddit post i also see videos and follow political channels from both sides that comment on the same issues, i can i also see people commenting on twitter and other social platforms saying the same retoric and calling people to join and do x because government is bad or because person x in government is a "dirty socialist" or a "fascist" etc
Lol you are from portugal a economic failed country because of taxes and is talking about US
Yes but us is not that violent
Freedom of speech existe and at least here my taxes are use to protect the human dignity that's the sanctity of life and offering equal protection to all the people from all walks of life/economics
And Btw the economi is growing, and problems that the economy has is because of the legacy left by fascist state and the mentality of the business man culture
Wtf
Us have human rights too
Us hdi is higher than portugal (human development index)
Do you have universal health care there
death penalty exists in the US
how does that respect the sanctity of human life
it doesn't respect
Public heatl care is horrible in portugal
They have death penalty in just some states
Just see the dhi and you can see that us is better to live that portugal
thats false, Portugal health care is one of the best in the world, ranking in the top 12 health care
No it is not lol
If you are saying about stats you can see the hdi rank that show portugal at 43th while Us is in 13th
I'm a 25 year old guy and I can tell you that they talk very openly, I have heard about mine and my siblings birth, I also heard about my cousins birth and my coworkers birth, like I started this job 4 months ago and already heard about their kids births
It doesn't even have to be a woman from your close circle
It can be a colleague from work (and she will even show you the photos of the baby in her phone without you even asking while she is telling the story of the birth) or even a random woman in the street
For example, in a public transport it wouldn't be weird if an older woman started talking about her experience to a pregnant woman or a woman with a baby sitting next to her
Caldo verde - a soup made of potatoes, kale and chorizo
Any soup with kale, meat, beans
I think I’ll make some soup tomorrow
The one and only Cozido á portuguesa
You eat one plate and you'll be satisfied for a week
Not sure it it's the same, but we also have "Carolino" Rice
Sounds similar to Karolina
When I went to the Netherlands, my Dutch friend told me I HAD to try kapsalon
After seeing my disgusted face after explaining what it was, he said "just wait until you're drunk
Or high
Accurate af
Love me some kapsalon
(And kroketten
And stroopwafel
And freshly sliced gouda on a slice of bread
And chocolate sprinkles on a slice of bread
Keep me away from your country or my clothes will stop fitting
French taco is definitely my comfort food whenever I travel to France
They are so good
Similar to Portuguese's "miséria", which can also translate as squalor
In portugal, we do small changes to almost all countries names to make them more Portuguese-y. But beside that small changes there is some who are very different:
Germany ->Alemanha
Switzerland -> Suíça (the spelling is very different but it sounds similar to the first part of the word)
Netherlands -> Países Baixos or Holanda
Spain -> Espanha (which is more like the name in spanish: España, so
USA -> only Estados Unidos (United States) or only America (If we would talk about the continent it would be North America or South America, not only America
I think the most different is Germany -> Alemanha
All the others are almost the same
Portuguese fun fact: the translation of turkey is peru, which is also a name of a country
In portuguese: Germany --> Alemanha/Netherlands --> Países Baixos
portugal is portugal  on almost all languages
There's quite a few " Mastro bar" here in Portugal
While it seems innocent enough to call your bar " flagpole bar", the truth is that when you read it it sounds like "masturbar", wich means to masturbate
The company that owns Biedronka is actually Portuguese, I don't think they thought too much about it and just went with an animal's name because of żabka and another store (can't remember the name) that has a bear in it's logo
There's also stores in Poland called "od i do" and if you add an f behind it then it becomes "fucked" in Portuguese
Ok, then my theory is irrelevant
I've always known it as Portuguese, not that JM bought it afterwards
My apologies
Os Lusíadas, by Luís Vaz de Camões, written in the XVI century
It was literally written to be *the* portuguese lyrical epic, par excellence
It's widely accepted as our national equivalent to the Aeneid and it was meant to laud the deeds of the portuguese discoverers
Yes
[Os Lusíadas] The name means "The Lusiads", another form of "The Lusitanians". The book is written in the form of Homero's Odissey and it's about the adventures of many Portuguese (Lusitanians) throughout history, until the year it was written (16th century)
The main focus is the adventures of the Portuguese navigators
This author, Luís de Camões, is also kind of like out "Shakespeare". He is the symbol of the Portuguese language
EDIT: when I wrote this, there was no other Portuguese contribution on this thread
When I submitted, there were other four
I knew that this question would bring a swarm of Portuguese
This book is really important for us
The "[Os Lusiadas] A XVI century epic poem, by [Luís Vaz de Camões] telling the history of Portugal
It is "Os Lusiadas", by Luis de Camões
Him and his work was ( and still is) so important to Portuguese culture, that our national holiday (Portugal's day) is at the tenth of June because that was the day in which Luis de Camões died
"Os Lusíadas" basically, **everyone** has to study numerous parts of the book
If you dont recognise the name it's a Portuguese maritime expansion epic composition by Luís Vaz de Camões
I really want to read Faust, but I want to read it in German
I'm currently at an A2 level
Do you think it's a hard read
I would like to have the capacity to fully enjoy the experience
I have Kalevala in a pretty blue hard cover
Got that one
Both poetic and prose
Sadly, I didn't find it all that interesting
That's not from Os Lusíadas though, it's just one of his poems
You can tell it doesn't have the structure in 8 line stanzas
Sorry, I didn't pay that much attention in Portuguese classes
But it's the only thing I from him that I found translated
And I dare not translate Camões
I'll remove it
Rural-turned-suburban Portugal we have plenty of rabbits
I've also seen a few hedgehogs and even a couple of mongooses
Foxes also roam the area, but not as near as these (I've only ever seen one in a corn field nearby)
All of them keep clear of the people and their pets, though
Nah very rare to see a stray dog nowadays
Some feral cats and birds and that's it
We should pressure sponsors to threaten to pull out
It’s an actual disgrace
People have died
A less controversial source saying the same thing:
They just do not care about food, not culturally
And I am not even talking about preferring recipes of one part of the world or another, I am talking of that mind-boggling thing to a portuguese person of lunch being industrial bread with something industrial (cheese, paste, whatever) and they are perfectly happy with it day in and day in and day in
On rich countries, with a lot of access to food
And not even comparing with southern european but on many, much poorer parts of the world, people would be much more demanding of imagination
I have no idea why food is not a big deal culturally for them
Consider Japan, which might have a similar climate and lack of resources and how obsessive they are into making a lot with meager resources
There are places with a coastline in Europe where people do not even distinguish types of fish and hardly eat them, or just deep fry fillets
we had our own monopoly on spice trade at another time, and we spice use in our cuisine
Your cuisine is just, well, not trying very hard
In fact supposedly we took chillies to India and others
>I mean it's in our culture because it has been that way for centuries
yes, but my point, my wonder is why it was like that centuries ago
Other cultures similarly poor in resources or variety of foodstuffs available could do much with very little, even often in the way of ritual
It is very interesting to me how disconnected nordic or northern european (as far as I can tell russians no) culture is from food as culture, pleasure
It is not like you can only compare northern and southern europe, I am thinking of the whole wide world
I am thinking not so much north necessarily but altitude can also be a huge limiting factor
The Himalayas, the Andes
Or heck, even Russian cuisine, which seems far more imaginative
It is a good interesting reply
It is still pretty shocking though modern food culture
>Again, where exactly did you expect the culture to come from
It's a thing that takes generations to develope
you were talking of andean people adpating culture from the spanish, of russians adapting culture from further south
(though finnish do not seem to have adapted russian style food)
Food is probably the fastest spreading culture, sweet potatoes as an ingredient spread all over the globe in less than a century after its "discovery" by europeans, including to the highlands of Papua New Guinea
>we are doing pretty well nowadays, if you've never had modern Danish haute cuisine, try it
I am not concerned, I was not talking about individual examples, or exceptions or haute cuisine
Or recipes even, I was talking more and more of everyday food everybody eats and how it can be important, a big deal
It is still strange to see norwegians perfectly happy with the white bread with paste sandwich for lunch every day of the week (hope they get something better for the weekend)
Or dutch people
Sacro Império Romano-Germânico
"Sacro" means sacred and I think you can understand the rest of the name
Sacro Império Romano - Sacred Roman Empire (Portuguese)
Should have seen your comment before commenting
We say the same, but with an additional '-' and accents '''.
Usually younger people tend to mix those words into Portuguese but we tend to avoid it to preserve our culture and language
It would be really weird to see some important organ in our government to use that kid of words
Portugal: No, simply because most of our words are very similiar to their english counterparts, so you'd basically be using the same word but it wouldn't flow as nicely as the almost exact same word in portuguese
For example the words you listed:
Computer: Computador
Message: Mensagem
Elevator: Elevador
Pretty much the same word, using the other words would just come off as someone trying to look cool
(Even if there ARE words we borrow from english, one I use a lot is just putting "tho" at the end of some sentences)
Not that i'm aware off and tbh i think that would be useless because you can't force people to use certain words instead of others, it just happens naturally
What does seem to happen here is that some loanwords just naturally become portuguese words due to people changing the way they are written over the years
Some examples of this are:
football -> futebol;
leader -> líder;
champagne -> champanhe, etc
I have a problem with prepositions
I sometimes mix in and on; to and at
I was recently corrected by a client because I said I would come back _at_ her soon
Apparently that's aggressive
Prepositions
Sometimes i don't really know which one to use - in/on/at
Push and pull, in Portuguese puxar (to pull) is spelt the same way as push but means the exact opposite, making it confusing as hell
I often mix up "always" and "also" but only when speaking, it's like I want to say one of the words but I accidentally say the other one
I was reading your post and thinking "Wow, this is indeed very confusing". And then I translated to Portuguese and it's "lavar and levar", and I got self-conscious
I think it's a matter of habit
I've heard non-native Romance language speakers saying that Romance Languages go wild with verbs
You'll get the hang of it
To answer your question: probably "push", because it sounds exactly like "puxe", which means pull
If you ever come to Portugal, doors in public places usually have both Portuguese and English sticker, and you will see many, many people who can't open a door
It's not like I get them mixed up but I always have to take an extra second to think about though, through, thought, and the word push like when it's written in a door because in Portuguese pull is "puxe" and it sounds the same as push so the amount of times I had to stop read push and think it's the contrary and still pulling it is ridiculous
When I was starting to learn English I often mixed up the verbs have and there be because
"Ter" means "to have"
"Haver" means "there be"
I mix up British and American spelling all the time
Words like "colour" and "favour" I always get right, but I never know when to use an "s" or a "z" in some words, and I end up going with the latter a lot more
Hand fingers and foot fingers are also a thing in Polish and in Portuguese
Same here
In Portuguese I mean, but the word is the same
I think it's got to do with the fact that "eventually" is a really useful word, whereas the correct use of "eventualmente" is usually something you can replace with more common words with the same meaning
Tbh a lot of people misuse "lay". It's one of my pet peeves
That and not using adverbs
Not just bicycles but also vehicles where you aren't the driver
Germans often say they're driving to a place when they're taking public transport, for instance
Well, I think every language has that kind of unwritten rules
The more you use the language, the more you use those expressions right
> Yugioh deck
That was unexpected and I giggled
Nice
Currently maybe no one alive
Eusébio was kind of (and a fado singer called Amália), and Cristiano Ronaldo might be one day
D.Sebastião (R.I.P.)
Cristiano Ronaldo, specially in Madeira
The poems he wrote in Milan were amazing
Sadly, it seems his inspiration ran out when he moved to London
Not in Portugal, I haven't met a single Portuguese who believes in such things and if there is any, they keep these believes to themselves for fear of being shuned or humiliated
I've never met an antivaxxer or a flat earther in my life
I could see climate change deniers being more common but still can't think of any I've met
>antivaxx, flat-Earth, climate change deniers
No, at least has far has i know, if there are they are extremely small and most people don't even know they exist
>Is anti-intellectualism a thing in your country
In broad general terms yes, somewhat, for example politically around transgender people, the left wing parties want to create legislation that would strengthen the protection of transgenders from discrimination for going to the bathroom of the sex they identify (although technically they already had that right and protection at a Constitutional level Art 13 n2 [the n2 gives a few examples of discrimination but it's not restricted to only those, there's also in the n2 discrimination base on sex that's that's already predicted so either way no one has a right to discriminate gender identity ], Art 21 the right to disobedience and art 26 the right to develop personality, but its a good thing they wanted to create more legislation because most people aren't smart enough and it gives a more solid protection against idiots that don't understand Constitutional law and think that the n2 of art 13 are only limited to those examples
The Christian rights wing and the center right are mostly against this, and the Christian right called it "Turing the school in to the bloco de esquerda summer camp" [Bloco de esquerda is one of the most pro lgbt political parties], the other day there was a debate between 2 lawyers on TV about the rights of transgenders, one of the themes was this one about bathroom, one said it was anti Constitutional letting them go to the bathroom of the sex they identify, he didn't justify with no articles or principles he was just saying BS, the other lawyer counter argumented and call on the BS of the other lawyer
I don't think so
We started hating the Germans after 90% of our young male population died in WW1, but 20 years later we had a guy come and say the Nazis were ok so Germany was fine now and that's about it
To a certain extent; yes
Until nowadays; definitely not
Well the EU and UN are primarily candidates since they were a direct result of anti war on Europe and anti war in general do to ww2 atrocities, there's also the American base in Açores but apparently the Americans stored illegal radioactive material and accidentally contaminated the some of the locals near the base having several cases of cancer link to that
Neither actually
But stuff much older than that still has an effect on our foreign policy
We are totally capable of never ever letting Olivença go without having it compromise our diplomatic relationship with Spain, and we invoke much older things occasionally
OTOH we have a particular concept of foreign policy which is basically very slow at changing ever and very consistent throughout decades or longer
>  but 20 years later we had a guy come and say the Nazis were ok so Germany was fine now and that's about it
Actually Salazar didn't like Hitler
One of the reasons for Portuguese neutrality was to not bring Spain to the Axis side
Yep, we do as well
Ever heard of *La Lys*?
No, he was friends with Hitler and Mussolini too
The only reason why Portugal didn't fight in WW2 was because we were sending shipments of ammunition to Germany while still allied with Britain
Spain was clouded in it's own civil war, don't bring her into this
[Portugal's role in keeping Spain neutral]
Base das Lajes leased to the british, also in this wikipedia article:
> In 1942 Lajes Field on the Azores was assigned the name Air Base No
4[4] and the Portuguese government expanded the runway and sent troops and equipment to Lajes, including Gloster Gladiator fighters
Military activity in the Azores grew as the Gladiators' role progressed into flying cover for Allied convoys, reconnaissance missions and meteorological flights
In August 1943, Portugal signed the Luso-British agreement, which leased bases in the Azores to the British
This was a key turning point in the Battle of the Atlantic, allowing the Allies to provide aerial coverage in the Mid-Atlantic gap; helping them to hunt U-boats and protect convoys
[5] Churchill surprised members of parliament (MPs) when he said he would use a 14th-century treaty; many MPs had not known that Portugal and England had the oldest operational alliance in the world, the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1373

...and the rest is history
Literally
It depends on the subreddit
On /r/migraine or /r/chronicpain definitely because people focus mostly on the American healthcare system, but on scientific subreddits not really
I do
Usually in issues relating with education, career and finances
The advices they give are completely disattached from my reality
Also we don't have racial issues or politically correct movements here
If they're mostly American and Canadian, yes, I do
Yes
Everything about insurance and access to medication is so weird in the US
I knew about it from migraine articles but reddit really opened my eyes
Being wholesome can be good but I in my view wholesomeness implies honesty
American white feminism TM is too widespread nowadays, and that can be a problem online
On the other hand, I understand that American feminist spaces should be first and foremost inclusive for American minorities, instead of foreigners
They're the ones dealing with the American reality
We do have racial issues here
We just had Mário Machado on TV
A frustrated dick head with probable sexual impotence is hardly a racial issue
I flirt more in English because the words don't seem to have the same impact to me and I become less afraid of making sexual inuendo and jokes
That happens to me when I'm speaking German
I sound like a Disney princess
Now imagine Portugal (at least Lisbon, but its getting bad everywhere) ... Same costs as you said, half the salary
Lisbon: Portuguese custard tart, Jerónimos Monastery, fado, Belém Tower, Terreiro do Paço, the zoo and the aquarium, arrogant people, football
Oporto: Clérigos church, friendly hard-working people who are loud and swear a lot, strong Northern accent, Port wine, football, francesinha, Casa da Música, unbeatable people - the city is called 'invicta' (unbeaten)
Coimbra: 725+ year-old university, rich student traditions, fado, alternative, Quinta das Lágrimas (where Peter I and Inês de Castro would meet in secret)
Aveiro: ovos moles, bad smell, canals (the town is called the 'Venice of Portugal'), striped houses by the beach
Viseu: lots of roundabouts, Palácio do Gelo, a particular accent which is hard to describe through text, the legend of Viriathus
Where are the best copypastas
Astrakhan
Even though a lot of the city now looks slummy and grim, Astrakhan still is a wonderful place with some fairly nice quarters and a unique culture and history, being located on the edge of Russia next to Kazakhstan and belonging to Central Asia more so than it does to Eastern Europe
Astrakhan has been a melting pot of Central Asian, European, Caucasian and Middle Eastern cultures for centuries and still has a fairly diverse population
It actually has one of the oldest Catholic churches in Russia and the oldest Kalmyk Buddhist temple that survived the Soviet era, and the city has more mosques than Russian Orthodox churches
Astrakhan’s diversity is reflected in that racism is very rare there compared to most of Russia
It also have a lot of fascinating and atypical nature, including steppes, semideserts, deserts, red hills, salt lakes and the Volga river delta
There is also an abundance of quality copypastas
Galway : hookers
You've clearly never been to Galway
The Galway Hooker is a kind of boat, that proudly serves as name of many of the city's businesses
Op does this question also can apply to Portuguese and Spanish empires
Well younger portugueses people really don't care about the colonian past, and the older generation is a bit more complicated in general they don't care, the much much older generations are a "bit racist" (you know how older generation are)
We do value and have great pride in the discovery age and the sea adventure part
There are memes about saying "Angola é nossa" but its mostly banter
We do have a close friendly relationship with every ex colonies something most other European countries don't usually have
I don't know
Like most of generation of the ultramar war was lost to the greed of the fascist regime, the revolutionary forces here in Portugal that ended the regime and war is what we most focus on since it was the thing that stop the atrocitie of being oppress
I personally don't know much about Savimbi, i know a bit but not much
I only know he fought has one of independence movement, my guess is that some survivors of the war might not like him but i highly doubt that because everyone was a pawn blindfolded and forced to fight
Portugal has very uniform person names, and surnames
There are however a few exceptions in surnames , normally related to either the Alentejo region or the insular regions (Madeira and the Azores)
Alentejo has a huge diversity of surnames, that originally were probably nicknames or professional designations that have become surnames and generally allow you to tell that someone is from Alentejo, and sometimes you can even pin-point the village from where their family is originally
For instance, in my own genealogical research I've come up with several surnames:
* Morganho - this was one the many designations for rural worker
Most of the people that I've seen with the surname are from Santa Eulalia a small village in the Elvas municipally
* Cascabulho - undefined term related to peels (it could be vegetable peels or tree bark), everyone with that surname can be traced back to a family in Serpa (medium size village near the Spanish border in the left side of the Guadiana river)
The Azores received a significant amount of Dutch catholic refugees, during the independence war of the Dutch republic, and the are certain surnames that can be traced to those settlers, like "Brum" which was originally "Bruyn".
You also have surnames that derive from agriculture terms that are specific of those areas like "Fraga", which means water stream/source but really isn't used in other parts of the country
In Madeira, you have the predominance of the Perestrelo surname, which is a surname of Italian origin (originally Parasttrelli) and was the surname of the first governor of the archipelago (the son of an Italian nobleman), and became an important and relatively common surname in Madeira
The only thing that I can remember is the surname Bettencourt that is widely spread in Madeira and the Azores
If the person has Maria had his second name is probably from Cascais lol
The thing with those type of surnames is that from very specific areas, but if you aren't local it's hard to associate the surnames with a region
I'm from Algarve and I know a few surnames that are very typical from a certain area, like Marreiros from Lagos, Bailote from Albufeira or Caliço in Loulé. However, a Northerner certainly wouldn't associate those surnames with Algarve, but maybe could associate them only with the South in general
Also Barradas, seems to be a name associated with Évora region
Im Portuguese and I didn't know that
You are confusing two things:
* Cascaense - someone that is from Cascais
* Cascalense - posh person that lives in Cascais and has an affected speech pattern, creating an unnatural nasal voice
The first would not be caught dead with "Maria" has a second name, and frequently jumps off the "Rata" beach wave breaker
The second believes there is a beach called "Praia da Moitas" between Cascais and Estoril
Yes, unless you are familiar with the surnames, you struggle to pin point the exact region
My experience is that surnames are more uniform north of the Tejo than south of the Tejo
Northerner here
I've never even seen any of those surnames before
Peixinho- it's common in Portimão, and 2 other families one in Leiria, the other in Coimbra(? No 100%certain)
>I don’t know
French, maybe
It is probably french
It is a founder´s effect maybe, in which some names can become common after a few centuries particularly in islands
Some of the first azorean settlers came from Flanders or northern France
They got other dutch type names also like Brum, Hintze
The city of Horta is named after its founder use name was flemish-dutch but not sure there is a definite spelling on how it was spelled
Other relatively common names in islands, can differ from mainlands, founders effects
Tavares and Varela are regular but not top frequency portuguese surnames, but they are very very frequent cape verdean surnames
And then there is the van dunem family in Angola, a very famous political family  (including the current portuguese minister of justice and kind of the former president of Angola), their name comes from a dutch ancestor some centuries ago
I can only speculate here
I don't know for sure as well
The Bettencourt name seems to be more common in the the Azores
I once heard that once upon a time there lived a very influential french family in the Terceira Island
Even today the Terceira accent [sounds very french]
Aveiro is a city in north-central Portugal (look, it is northern to me, northernmost third of Portugal)
It is a place name
Santos is one of the most common surnames in the portuguese and spanish languages
I'm not knowledgeable in the genealogy of the Madeira region, but Aveiro might mean that the family originally came from Aveiro, perhaps even relatively recently
Very likely being that Aveiro is an important port city, and hence had significant maritime traffic with Madeira
As for "dos Santos", like u/uyth already said, it is a very common surname
Frequently (not always), it means that someone was a baby orphan placed in the "roda", a wheel that was outside monasteries and churches, where mothers wishing to abandon their new born child placed the baby in complete anonymity
The surname "do Espirito Santo" has the same origin
It's quite a popular male name among people from "good" families in Portugal, I have a baby cousin that has Maria as his second name
Not sure if it's related, that is what people from outskirts Sesimbra, call to the Sesimbra's natives
(basically what the farmers call the fishermen)
>sounds very french
That is in the (in)famous town of Rabo de Peixe in São Miguel, not Terceira
You have the explanation [here] It is of Normand origin, but afterwards they became an important family in the Azores, hence why it is so common there
> but Aveiro might mean that the family originally came from Aveiro, perhaps even relatively recently
place names are really common surnames in Portugal but I think almost none are correlated to recent origin from that place
Names like Albuquerque (a village in the raia), Braga, Évora, Lisboa, Aveiro, Castelo Branco, Coimbra, Guimarães, Maia, Serpa, usually do not mean the family can trace an origin to there, not recently though, maybe only in the middle ages
It is just a name
Like in english maybe York/Yorke can be  a family name
Very cool I never knew that "dos Santos" was linked to being orphan and being placed in the "roda", my great grandfather was abandoned/adopted and he had "dos Santos" in his name
The version we have is that he was left at the doorstep of a house but maybe that didn't actually happen
The family in Portimão work in the harbor, maybe it's a regular thing
I agree with you, many place surnames are relatively common, and cannot definitely be traced, at least recently to that given place
However, in this case, given that Aveiro as a surname is not common (at least that I have noticed), and that he is from Madeira
I would say probably it means that one of his ancestors was from Aveiro and for some reason settled in Madeira
Myself, one of my surnames is Granja, a relatively common surname, however in my particular case I've traced the name to a soldier named José Gonçalves, who served in Bucelas in the defenses protecting Lisbon during the Napoleonic wars
He was from Granja do Ulmeiro (near Coimbra), and hence took the surname Granja
You can easily check that by looking at his baptism church records
If he was left at a church institution, you might also finds records of his finding which generally detail the items that he was left with
Occasionally mothers left signs that latter would let them identify the child if their situation changed
If you want, PM me and I will point you in the right direction
It might be a local nickname that became a surname
Surnames only really became stable in the late XIX
Born and lived in Portugal until I was 18, moved to China to study and work and recently came back to Europe for a more stable and safer life
I don't see myself going back to Portugal until I'm well established with my career, job opportunities are subpar compared to the rest of Europe
I do however spend 90% of my holidays there
Não é por nada, mas quase tenho a sensação que te estou a dar stalk pois já associo a tua flair à história do namorado que é canadiano e que vem morar para Portugal :) Talvez porque visitamos muitas vezes os mesmos subs ahahah
De qualquer maneira boa sorte com isso Portugal tb é fixe para se viver, eu pelo menos gosto
depois tens de mudar o flair para "PT, lived for X amount of years in ESP"
Só uma curiosidade, ainda tens sotaque português ou já é meio portunhol

Thanks Rosetta Stone
Je suis trés content, parce que je suis trés content
I have no idea how it came about, I think it was a friend of my brother from ages ago who came up with it
It kind of became a meme among us and made its way into my psyche
I was lied to
Confirm
The calmness and the bright open blue sky
I've never noticed or valued it until I went abroad
That which made me want to go elsewhere, is also what made me miss Portugal the most
Everything here ends up seeming very stale
Being in Portugal is like being in "Europe's country side", it's very peripheral
But after being a long time in other big capitals, my god, Lisbon seems so modest and so  easy
Edit: I remember being several months in Barcelona and then arriving in Lisbon
The Sun shone in an empty blue sky and everything looked so small
I keep getting the same feeling upon each return
And now, I find myself cozy in the thoughts when I'm abroad and tired
Portuguese escudo banknotes
I really can't get used to those overly neutral euro banknotes
Would love to see some historical figures in it
I know it would be a lot of trouble choosing people universal enough to figure on those but it would be lovely to have some faces in the banknotes
But well, that's just wishful thinking

Are they any cool youtube channels (or other things) that show off your country
("Are *there
Usually when I'm curious about what a country looks like I go to their wikipedia entry, but a lot of the time there aren't enough images featured that give a good idea as to what said country looks like
Recently I've began watching youtube videos that show off countries and which give a sense of what they look like
I'm wondering if anyone can suggest good youtube channels and/or videos that feature videos that show what your country looks like
Things like video tours and guides, overhead drone footage, or even travel vlogs
I particularly like POV videos shot with quality cameras and lenses
Also, they don't have to necessarily be on youtube
They can be on any platform
There's a channel called 360portugal which showcases drone footage from the bigger cities to small historical villages
Those are great
Thanks
Lmao people don't actually do that, do they
Also I love snow, but I'm sure I'd change my mind if it still looks like that in Spring
Oh yeah that's a good one
My only issue, which isn't that big tbh, is that the colours look a bit weird in some of the videos
Oh yeah I've been watching that one
It's a really good channel that one
At first I was scared it would just be him mocking the places he visits but he's actually super sympathetic to the people living there and he does try to highlight the positive qualities
I wasn't expecting so many replies
I'm very thankful to everyone who's shared their recommendations
And do the clothes manage to dry
I hang my clothes out as well, but when it rains (or looks as though it's going to rain) I just hang them indoors
I wouldn't consider it the worse, actually I'd say most people in Portugal are proud of it, we are the biggest trollers the world have had, sad only we know it
Take a look  [Caralho]
It was a national hit but I honestly don't like the song
"Parti o telemovel"
I think that was the name, that singer with the dancing dude, basically his song is about how he broke his phone
Why Portugal, why
At least it wasn't the Israeli chicken lady
All of them except maybe three (I could be reaching tho)
[The one that led us to victory]
Almost all of your entries since 2013 have been good, though
And your winner in 2019 is amazing
I love how we collectively decided to completely repress from our memories from the 2004-2007 period at Eurovision and don't even think of them when we're asked this question
I mean, we have [this]
It lacked cultural context
I look at that clip and go "That shit's pretty funny". But if you're not in the know, it just looks dumb
Do it for you lover was very bad
I'm sorry
"Paper" is an awesome song in the studio, but all the bad decisions that were possible to be made *were made* regarding the live performance
"This is My life" is the best 2000s 90s song
Not winning does not mean they're bad
It does not mean they're bad at all
There's over 40 countries, the likelihood of anyone winning Eurovision nowadays is completely different than it was 30 years ago
And sometimes, a song can be amazing, but then some bad decisions with the staging or an underwhelming delivery by the singer can ruin its live performance
"Occidentali's Karma", the Italian entry of 2017, "failed to win" because the staging was subpar and the magic that it had in Sanremo just wasn't there
But it doesn't stop it from being one of the best and most loved Eurovision songs of the decade
I actually love that song, but I have a thing for 80's synthpop
The UK has a peculiar perspective on Eurovision, due to various factors
It's basically a sum of:
* The already outsider feeling when it comes to Europe in general, causing them to sometimes fail to understand why other countries' songs are doing well and getting angry at Europe for not voting for them, because "tHEy Don'T LikE Us".
* Years and years of success in Eurovision since
ever, really until 1997 which completely skewed their concept of success in the show and gave them their mentality into "any result below 5th place is a disaster".
* Years and years of Terry Wogan (and currently Graham Norton) commentating the live shows with a sarcastic tone and making jokes at the performances and the countries, which made people watch the show for their commentary and not for the actual music show
This also ultimately led to the mindset that all votes are political and unfair as Terry Wogan ever more bitterly emphasized that in his commentary throughout the years (espeically when countries from Eastern Europe and the Balkans started to join the show)
With all of this, no serious artist wants to risk their reputation going to Eurovision as it's currently a career killer
Also, Eurovision is a 3-month endeavor at least and is completely non-paid throughout
No reputed artist will sacrifice their schedules without seeing a penny
Why would you do this to me
I'd completely forgotten about the Dark Ages of Eurovision
Also [this]
This usually happens the years after we send a good song and Europe completely shits on us
Five
No football that day
We friends
We had so many points we wanted to share some of them
Solidarity
It was a truly terrible song, and we know all about having shit songs
We didn't want you guys to have to go through that alone

[This] was the highlight of "Do It For Your Lover" (Spain 2017)
In 2018 and 2019, Greece had amazing songs, but they singers just didn't really deliver them that well live
But studio versions are great
But there was a sense of self-awareness there, which made it good
It's the ones that try to pass off as something serious when they're not that are usually the worst
How was Eurovision in Italy unknown in the 90's? You literally hosted it in 1991
Also, "Fiume di Parole" is a hell of a song
I actually enjoy that song, but I agree the live performance is one of the worst in our history
>the public perception of Eurovision is stuck in about 1975 with lamé costumes, nonsense "bing-bang-a-bong" lyrics and wobbly cardboard sets
One of the things that completely shocked me regarding the UK was when a couple of years ago, the UK had a national final (I think it was 2018), and they had a panel of guests commentating on the songs
I don't fully remember who those people were, but I remember at some point in the show, they were asked what was their favorite Eurovision song ever
Didn't have to be a winner, just a favorite Eurovision song
2 out of 3 answered "Waterloo" and the third one answered "Heroes", the winner song from 2015
Because one of the hosts of the show was Måns Zelmerlöw.
Who sang "Heroes" at Eurovision 2015 and won
These were people invited to comment on and evaluate songs for the UK to send to Eurovision and you could tell they clearly couldn't name more than 2 songs out of over 1,500 entries
I'm a Eurovision fan in general
Well, you just proved most of my points, though
The UK has that mentality that Eurovision is bad and tacky and that's how it's supposed to be, fueled by years of conditioning by the BBC commentary
It's not
Eurovision is supposed to be a serious music contest, and more importantly, a serious, entertaining, quality TV show
Most other countries take it seriously, and especially in later years, even if they still fail to recruit their top talent to the show, due to its damaged reputation from the 2000s and the fact it's not a remunerated endeavour, like you said
That alone is enough to scare them away
But you still see countries putting some effort and trying to step up the song quality and their production quality
There's still the odd gimmick and silly song here and there, but the years of full wackiness and gimmicks are now gone
Also, calling out "Toy" just for the chicken noises, and the other songs over their theme and visuals the is *precisely not understanding why they did well* and thus failing to replicate what made them good
"Toy" was a very original and unique song, instrumentally and vocally, very reflective of Netta's own unique music style and the country it came from, about woman empowerment in a year where the #MeToo movement was going strong
The 2016 winner was a very emotional ballad with a chilling single moment, both vocally and visually that no one else in that year came close to replicate
The 2015 was just a radio-friendly pop song, but sang by a very charismatic singer and with a very strong and almost flawlessly executed visual performance
Eurovision is a TV show after all, this is part of it
The UK songs lately have had good singers, but the songs have been the blandest, soulless, vacuous crap anyone has seen
They have no originality, the lyrics are surprisingly bad, considering you literally invented the English language and there's no regard to how to properly visually present said songs to make them more compelling
The only recent year where there was any semblance of proper staging, which was 2017, ~~you came 11th place
Who knew actually putting some effort into it would work
And let it be said, 11th place is a GOOD RESULT~~. **EDIT:** *It finished 15th, like another user pointed out
My point still stands, it's a better result than usual
* There's over 40 countries now, at this point winning Eurovision is almost a lottery, it's just not going to happen as easily as it did when there were only 18 countries participating
On a side note, I find it funny that you decided to completely ignore 2017's or 2019's winners because they don't serve your argument
As for political voting, yes, there's still some, but it mainly affects qualification streaks - which is something the UK doesn't have to worry about - and the middle of the table, like the Cyprus/Greece, Romania/Moldova and Serbia/Montenegro pairings
For the last decade, the top 10 has actually been the top 10 best songs of that year
Yes, the song is not bad, but the performers are
The instrumental in the FdC version gives it some joy, but the voices are still bad
We still don't know if Little Big is coming back, but Daði Freyr is taking part in the contest again this year
>> Eurovision is supposed to be a serious music contest, and more importantly, a serious, entertaining, quality TV show
>No it isn't.
I feel like if this is where you start, there's no point in me keeping counter-arguing
But like I said, I still firmly believe that British people and the BBC not taking it seriously is half the problem of the UK not getting good results at the show
Eurovision is SO MUCH cheaper to produce than people think
The fact it draws money from 40 something countries and the fact there's a huge return for broadcasters in terms of ratings and brand awareness makes it so worthwhile
Like it was said, any single episode of The Voice or any other Saturday entertainment show costs double than what a Eurovision show costs
We did fight in WWI, but let's say it didn't went that well in like every front possible and we don't really celebrate (or even think about) the Great War like I've seen you do in the UK
The only thing we're really "thought" is that, there was a soldier who allegedly killed lots of Germans at the Battle of La Lys (which if you've never heard of it, was a allied disaster) and then saved a Scottish officer, nicknamed *Soldado Milhões*
Poppies are flowers of spring anyway, it is stupid they use them in November
Definitely not a thing in Portugal and we fought in WW1 as well
It’s even sadder that we lost so many people especially in the battle of La Lys and we, normal people, don’t really honor them :(
I still refer it as Czech Republic
I'm too used to calling it that
*Chéquia* is really weird in portuguese, i still prefer *Républica Checa*
In my language -chi- is read -shi- not -ki- so instinctively it changes the sound of pronunciation in a really stupid way
Czech you read with a k sound, but if you wrote it chia you read it shia and is just stupid
Plus a lot of z, ch sounds on a row
Same
I prefer it since most countries don't have "Republic" in them in common speech, but it **is** awkward to say in both English and Portuguese
Would it not just be "Chequia" in Portuguese
It sounds god awful
It would Chéquia at best and just looks and sounds quite bad
The embassy calls itself Embaixada da República Checa em Lisboa so that it will be  their official name in Portuguese
>How is this related
It is an english term, not protuguese one, in portugal you can call it Chéquie like brazilians, cant you
Actually no, Portuguese usage is different to Brazillian usage, different norms and it would be very stupid and be wrong
And I thought we were asked our opinion of the english term
Which is not an english word, and when presented out of the blue a word I had never encountered and with which I did not grow up my instinctive way of pronouncing it is the phonetical rules I learnt for my native language
>i dont see how using Chéquie would be problem for portuguese speaking, other than being it a foreign word
You understand so little of Portuguese you think it would be spelled with an -e at the end
It would be with an -a. And just like you do not get why Chéquie would be very wrong, you do not get why even when corrected also sounds badly
I did not want to correct your original spelling but it is worth pointing you got no instincts for what would be right or wrong in Portuguese
I absolutely agree with you, forget the other guy
The Portuguese Monarchical [flag] It was used from 1830 until 1910
White and blue were the traditional colours of the monarchy so in 1910 with the Republican Revolution the flag was changed to the colours of the Republican Party (red and green)
I think the old colours just go better together
Th eagle looks like it's about to sneeze
Not only does it work better together, it represents the country and our relationship  with the sea much better than red and green
That flag doesn't include the seas nor the Azores because it was used before the Age of Discoveries
The shields represent the 5 shields of the moorish kings our first king, Dom Afonso Henriques, defeated in the battle of Ourique
It is just a coincidence, but Teutonic knights were often associated with the archbishop of Cologne
"Envy" = "Inveja" vs "Jealousy" = "Ciúmes".
Honestly, I can't remember a case in my language where the two words are interchangeable
The second one, AFAICR, is only used in interpersonal relation contexts, whereas the other, while having a broader range of possible meanings is not used in those contexts
We have ciúme and inveja and despite having slightly different meanings ciúme is often seen as inveja
The opposite doesn't happen as much because ciúme is usually used only in romantic situations, while inveja can be used in a lot of different situations
Their specific meanings according to the dictionary are:
Ciúme: fear that other people's affection is not exclusively for us
Inveja: Desire to possess what someone has, usually accompanied by hatred for the possessor
Well, they aren’t, but in some cases people prefer to use jealous instead of envy (because they think it’s a negative thing)
“tenho ciúmes dessa tua camisola”.
Honnestly, I think I never came across that
But, considering all the other abuses our language is subject to, I have no problem in believing that some people would say something like :
"Que ciúmes que tenho do teu carro novo"
It sounds weird, but, sadly, not quite as weird as it should
It would be in here, but there people who take it seriously and avoid the word “envy” like the plague
Now there’s a new trend among them “inveja da boa”, like “tenho inveja, da boa, do teu carro” or to emphasize it “tenho inveja, mas da boa, do teu carro”.
Yeah, not usual, I came across it with people who avoid using the envy word
Sounds weird
Edit: a new trend among those is “inveja da boa” – see my other comment
There is no such thing as a dialect in Portuguese, at least not in the sense that one understands for other European countries (I lived in Umbria for two years, speak fluent Italian, and if someone talks to me in Perugino I struggle to follow)
Portuguese is a very uniform, even if you take in to consideration the other Portuguese speaking countries, with the exceptions of the creoles of Cabo Verde and Guinea, but those aren't really dialects but languages in themselves
This uniformity is due to several factors, firstly Portugal as been a single political entity since the twelve century, that exists to a large extent within the same borders on a previously existing Roman province
So internally there hasn't been any physical or political barrier that promoted differentiation
Also, from a historical perspective, Portuguese is really Galician spoken south of the Minho river
Politically, Portugal was born in the north, and expanded sound
In that expansion not only the language of the north was the official language, but also during the XII and the XIII centuries, due to the constant wars, the territory was significantly underpopulated, so there were movements of people coming from the north to the south, from northern Portugal and from Galicia, further ensuring language uniformity
The flow of population from Galicia to Portugal lasted until the early XX century
The only significant physical barrier that promoted some differentiation is the Atlantic ocean, Portuguese spoken in both the Azores and the Madeira islands is different from continental Portuguese
But again they always belonged to the same political entity as the mainland, and thus it always has been under some pressure to stay the same, especially in the last decades with TV and a much easier movement of people
So one would not really call it a dialect, but it is much more an regional accent of the same language with some local words
There is one notable exception, [Mirandes] which since 1999 as been granted the status of official language
It is spoken in a small region in northeastern Portugal, in a region stuck between the Douro river and mountains, which ensured it's isolation
However, it is a dialect but not of Portuguese, it belongs to the [Asturleonese] language a now practically extinct Iberian-Romance language
We have a lot of different accents, specially if you count Brazil and the other lusophone countries, but Portugal alone has a few as well, i would say around 10
They're all pretty much understandable with only a few differences in pronounciation and grammar
The hardest ones to understand are probably the ones from the islands (Madeira and Azores) as they have a thicker accent
>hundreds of thousands of speakers in Spain
The [UNESCO] ranks the Asturleonese as a "Definitely endangered" language, and estimates the number of speakers to be 150 000, which is only technically "hundreds of thousands", and is expected to go extinct in two generations
It is far from being an example of vitality
We call it Pfizer
I am sure the 20 something billion Euros that Biontech got in the last year is smoothing the name pain
Usually "Pfizer vaccine". Sometimes, usually in writing, "Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine". Though BioNtech did get a lot of media attention back when the vaccine was about to be approved
I occasionally see Pfizer-Biontech, but it's rare
English, German, Italian, French, Spanish (Castellano) and Portuguese
Obrigado in Portuguese of course
Some variation of Gracias in Spain
Merci in French and kinda in Romania
Tak for the Scandinavia region
Danke for Germany and Germanic friends
Italian, Grazie
Russian and Im assuming Ukrainian, Spasiba
and thank you ofc
Oh, interesting
TIL
Just to add that it originally was used as an expression that meant "I'm obliged/bound to you," so it does need to be declined by gender
It says a lot about or knowledge and relationship with the rest of European history
Reminds a party where a Portuguese pal was talking about Hitler and second WW and suddenly asked a Polish: “What would you do if your country was invaded by Hitler
Edit: or a friend of mine who, looking at a sport jacket with DDR embroidery in it,  was wondering what football team was it
I mean who even got offended by it
We don't ha é Irish people here and I assume most people wouldn't understand the reference

[Vikings invaded a northern city in Portugal] way before we were a country
Has evidence of a Viking settlement,  there is higher percentage of blonde people with blue eyes than in any other part of the country
Untill this day we use [runes] in boats and "sweaters" which are Viking inspired
Portugal faced the Ottomans several times in the Indian Sea
The costs of those battles and their parcial success made the spice trade unprofitable and so the portuguese decided to turn to South America to cover those expenses, and this is how Brazil was born
The Military Order of Christ is the former Knights Templar order as it was reconstituted in Portugal after the Templars were abolished on 22 March 1312, and it's still active, with the President of the Portuguese Republic as its Grand Master
In Portugal, there’s a whole music style based on perverted music
It’s called “Pimba”
There are pleanty of evidence that the Portuguese knew about America before at least 1498
(The Portuguese crown had  a secrecy policy because if the spanish knew that portugal discovered a whole new continente they could invade
At the time portugal had 1 million population spread across portugal, Africa, midle east, india and far east, and spain had about 5 million concentraded on their mainland
So it is thought that the portuguese crown sent columbus ( really close to the portuguese royal family) to "discover" America to distract the Spain
Our football team bears the order's cross, if you look closely
I think the air force also uses the symbol
The king (don't remember which) refused to expell the order from Portugal because it had been a valuable ally
Was also thanks to the order that Portugal was able to kick-start the age of discoveries
The order kept ancient science documents and other documents from Islamic scholars, which was prohibited by the church
Portugal took this knowledge and built the first global Empire
Also fun fact, one of the symbols, the armillary sphere, is in the flag, making Portugal the only country in the world (I think) to have a scientific device in it's flag
On the other hand, we eat snails
They're called caracoletas
Innuendo would be a better description
So cool
We have something really similar called “Bolinho de Chuva”
I prefer appelflappen, those are so good
Francis Drake's ships also looted Peniche and destroyed Sagres, while they were supposed to be helping the Portuguese defend against the Spanish
We have the expression "Friend from Peniche" (*Amigos de Peniche*) that means a fake friend, it originates from that time when the Portuguese were holding on in Lisbon waiting for the English to help, who they thought were in Peniche getting ready, their friends from Peniche who never came
It’s different than hip hop, because they use words with two meanings
I think the most similar style in terms of meaning would definitely be disco polo
For example, what I understand from the videoclip of "[Ona lubi pomarancze] is that she leaves her fiancé at the altar because she loves oranges, which means she likes women (oranges as a metaphor for boobs)
Am I reading that correctly
This is what our Pimba does
We have songs saying stuff like "I put the car in the neighbours' garage at any time I want" (= I insert my penis in my neighbours' vagina at any time I want) or using metaphors to compare people with animals (mostly farm animals)
The portuguese sailor's had already been close to that area, because when coming from India to Lisbon the winds that are favorable push the vessels towards brazil
Moreover, when columbus crossed the atlantic he used the maritime currents and only the portuguese sailed on those waters
Also, when coming back to Spain, columbus stopped in the Azores and was jailed, because they thought he had betrayded Portugal by giving Spain the new world, the Portuguese king realesed Columbus because ( due to the scheme)
There is also a theory that Columbus was a portuguese nobleman that , hence he was married with ( probally the most powerfull woman at the time) a member of the royal family
According to this theory columbus was from a Town called Cuba ( in portugal), it is thought he named Cuba after his Homeland
This is all specullation, but has a good chance of being true
Also, a fun fact, there is a portuguese map showing the Florida peninsula 8 years before it was "discovered". The map was kept in secret for many years
As I said, its all speculation
But your argument is flawed
To navigate across the ocean you need to have reading skills, math, astrology, navigation, and rank
A fisherman could never sail across the atlantic, everybody at the time KNEW the earth was round
Columbus was married to the sister of the king, therefore he was married to one of the most powerfull woman in the world  he could never have been a monority, much less a fisherman, he was a nobleman and had an entire island that produced lucrative sugar
Moreover, he probally had formal education as his Portuguese was flawless, but his Spanish had some "portuguese-like" words that arent that way in spanish
Is it Socorro or something like Maria de Socorro
Yes, also typically names like that are prefaced Maria in Portugal, so I was curious if it's the same in Spain
We have our [own martial art]
It's called "stick game".
Oh no

Nós também dávamos luta a esses cabrões todos, caralho
Wow, really cool the read about all this surreal parties I never ever heard about
Thank you
Unfortunately, I cannot contribute to this thread, because I don’t think we have (or ever had) parties like these
Only far right or far left, some related to retired people or monarchy, but those don’t count, I guess
The PURP (Partido Unido dos Reformados e Pensionistas/United Party of Retirees and Pensioners) literally just boomers, it's a party of retired people only
The only thing everyone ok that party agrees is that they are anti-austerity
That sounds like good politics
This needs to be an International
Movement
Long Live the First AntiPowerPoint International
Even I would support that
As you said, we have the PURP: Retirees and pensioners party
That in itself is a bit absurd
The funny part is they have a political youth wing
Then there’s also PCTP-MRPP, which is a sideline maoist party that refers to the more mainstream PCP - portuguese communist party - as “social-fascists”
O André ventura e joacine acho que ainda tinham lugar aqui
You most definitely could
There's also RIR (reagir, incluir e reciclar) led by Tino de Rans their main objective is to 'recicle' Portuguese democracy through citizen participation and inclusiveness
yeah we have  PCP-PEV ( Portuguese Communist Party  and Green Party coalition, most commonly known as CDU) and BE (Left Block, a "New far left party")
Both made part of the government last legislation with PS (Socialist Party)
This legislation has only PS on the government with about 36% votes, but they are backed sometimes by PCP-PEV and BE, and sometimes PPD/PSD (Social Democratic party, I guess a center-right/ conservative-liberal party)
And they are well represented in the parliament and still dominate politically a lot of unions
Se a pergunta fosse em relação à políticos, acredito que sim
And "RIR" means "to laugh" in portuguese
Yeah, I get confused too when I see german elections
Maybe Romania
I'm a bit curious but why Portugal
I don't think so, but in my experience trains aren't particularly noisy
Maybe because when I do take them I take the early morning one towards Lisbon, so its mostly people travelling for work and trying to either get some extra sleep or extra work
Sometimes you get people talking to each other, but most tend to speak quietly anyway
I suppose trains filled with university students and younger people have a different environment
We have trains but not where I live :(
Guimarães, small old city to the north of Portugal, even the food is amazing
Porto is great and I love it but Lisbon has my whole heart
The vibe is amazing and I wish I could live there
I'll have to go for Lisbon
It's my home, almost always has been, the place where I was born and where I created my best memories
It has stuff other Portuguese cities don't. It's, by far, the biggest city, it has that cosmopolitan feel which, in my opinion, at least, is kind of lacking in other cities, Porto included
There's everything here, a little too many tourists tho, ngl
The weather is just fine with only two very hot and two very cold weeks a year (very hot being 40ºC and very cold being close to 0ºC)
It's safe, beautiful (some parts) and a pleasure to live in
I looove Warsaw and Gdansk
They have such unique vibes
I really liked the old part of the city, the sea, and it had some interesting museums
It also is a very clean and bright city compared to other ones in Poland
In general I really liked the feel of the modern city
I'm actually learning German and that sub has helped so much
And it's really good meme wise
I filter hundreds of subreddits that have a chance to appear in r/popular
I also ignore (using RES, their posts and comments completely disappear) trolls and people whose opinions are not worth listening to
I don't really care about reddit recipes anyway
Most of them are basically something nice covered by 3kg of butter/cheese/sugar that take an afternoon to make
I remember that when I was in primary school we went to a home for mentally disabled people once, and I recall being shocked at the state of it
It wasn't at all a modern facility, rather some old building that I imagine had been there for many decades
It was damp and clearly had some insulation problems (there was also mold in certain parts)
I remember thinking to myself how such a place could be in that state, and just felt awful for the people living there
Everything about that home looked run-down and felt depressing
I had a similar experience when on another occasion we visited an orphanage
While not as bad as the home for the disabled, I still felt sorry the kids had to live in such a place
It just didn't seem very inviting or cozy like a home should feel
Made me realize just how fortunate and privileged I truly was
In 1940 Portugal sent Humanitian aid to Finland, why
Finland had just beaten USSR and the portuguese facist regime hated communists, as the Finnish people were facing food shortage, food was sent from Portugal
It wasn't much but it was honest food aid
Portugal and Venezuela have had some peculiar diplomatic incidents
They accused us of transporting explosives to Venezuela via our national airline and also accused Portugal of illegaly transporting Juaido's uncle
They accused Portugal of blocking covid vaccines to their country along with Spain, England and the US
And lastly Nicolas Maduro accused Portugal of sabotaging the transport of pork ham to Venezuela, thus ruining their typical Christmas dish
Now they rely on Russia for that lmao
Also Venezuela has a big Portuguese community (used to be more), so it's kinda weird all this conflict
According to legends, Władysław III of Poland (Also king of Hungary), survived the Battle of Varna then he settled on Madeira island and probably die there too
It just a legend about this King of Hungary exiled after a military disaster (Battle of Varna)
BUT I like to think it's funny that the last King of Hungary also die in Madeira Island exiled because a military disaster (WW1) with connection to the legend
So yeah, if you are King of Hungary and did poorly in military stuff, just go to Madeira
Then we got insulted by some Finnish governmental official around the euro crisis in 2012/13
which led to this absolute gem of a masturbatory history video about the stuff we've been doing for the last centuries, we want them to know about:
Edit: video is a bit old
We won a Eurovision song since then
We mock the Brits for all the nonsense they get up to and get pissy for some of the backstabbing they did

I read the official investigation report (in Portuguese) just for kicks and trust me it was extremely enjoyable  as a read, better than 99% of "humor" fiction published
Would recommend
The people writing that report, living the dream, some people got all the luck
I'm half-Portuguese, half-British, specifically Scottish
I identify with both countries, but I'd be lying if I said I don't feel more Portuguese then I do Scottish
This is because I grew up and lived most of my life in Portugal, I went to school and university here, most of my connections are with Portuguese people, and Portuguese is the language I use most in my daily life
That being said my mother (who's Scottish) has always tried to make me aware of my other identity
This wasn't always for the best, as I remember being exposed a little too much to the British expat scene, which has always felt alien to me
But I'm thankful for being exposed to British media from a young age, and being able to learn English at home
I really do love Scotland though
It's a place I tend to go back to every year, be it to visit that side of my family, or to explore parts which I'd never been to before
It's my home away from home in other words
And I was very fortunate to have had the chance to do my master's there and experience living in Edinburgh for a year
In some ways it made me feel more Portuguese than ever, yet on the other hand I feel as though it reinforced my Scottish heritage
I finally experienced what it's like to actually live Scotland rather than it just be a place I go on holiday for two weeks
Portugal, despite its issues, is the place I see myself in in the future
That being said, I was trying to return to Scotland and get a job there, but the pandemic put a halt to those plans
I'm half Portuguese half Brazilian almost the same thing
Basically me, but substitute Irish for Scottish and Spanish for Portuguese
I do have the accent though
What small moments in your country's history changed the entire course of history
For example, when Napoleon's troops reached Lisbon, they only missed the royal family's ship by an hour, approximately
If they had arrived a bit earlier, the court would have never left for Brazil
A very religious boy decides to go to North Africa to go to war against others religious boys, disappears, and blue balls everyone until these day every time there's fog
To be honest, we still think he was a nutjob
We had spies going by land towards India, so the king knew he was full of shit
Plus, when Columbus came back he landed in Portugal before going back to Spain and he bragged
8 Years later, we landed in Brazil
Don't forget: right after the 7 years war was lost and France's economy was in ruins
It's not really that he was a "nutjob", or that the king knew he was "full of shit". The thing is that those voyages needed a extraordinary amount of resources to pull off, so there was a limited amount of voyages you could actually support
Besides, Columbus didn't simply "get lost", as it's now common to say
He was following our navigation maps
Navigators were supposed to follow closely africa's shoreline, but then needed to go deep into the ocean, to avoid strong currents that would fuck up the ships
Columbus just went too deep into the ocean and found the Caribbean
Not only that but the king also had spies, like Pêro da Covilhã, who gave him reliable information that India was on the opposite side of the world
Listening to Columbus would be a very expensive shot in the dark
Not sure if this is taught to foreigners, but in Portugal we rarely use the second-person plural nominative personal pronoun **vós** (the plural "you" basically)
It's archaic, instead we use **vocês**, and the verb conjugation differs
In Portuguese we say "Que tal
" to ask what the other person thought of something or whether something went good for them
Does it also have that meaning in Spain
Examples: A friend tries a food or drink for the first time, they take a bite/sip, you ask "Que tal
". Or for the second meaning, you see a friend after an important presentation they had to do, you ask "Que tal
(And in our case it sounds more like "ktal" because we hate vowels
Huh, in Portuguese it also means ready
And it's also something we say either after reaching a conclusion/decision or before we start to discuss or take care of something
I guess an English equivalent would be "Alright then".
They only translate the two major cities in Portugal:
Lisboa - Lisbon
Porto - Oporto
The rest, they just mispronounce it
( They = British tourists that invade Portugal by the summer)
Where's The Shire
In portuguese we write it like Sófia for that reason
That way we open the "o"
I really hate the "Oporto" translation
I dont really know why but I think it's so useless
But yes they totally butcher Coimbra, Algarve and Sintra (the ones I hear mispronouncing the most)
From German, possibly
It's also Lissabon in German
You lovely capital is named Helsínquia in Portuguese
Well, the chain was founded by a Portuguese ao, probably now you know where the name came from ;)
I translated how we say it in Portuguese in a literal way ahahah I know it sounds weird
Can't do the phonetics in Finnish, sorry
One of my favorite is from over there but I can't speak a word
Let's try in english:
Hell - sin - kia ( like the korean cars)
Corvo island
In Portugal maybe the region of Alentejo
Basically the interior that is far from the main cities
If we're disregarding the mainland, then [the Savage Islands] are probably the most remote part of the country
Literally no one lives there except a handful of scientists
It is a huge problem here in Portugal, it is a process that has started in the 50's, and has never stooped
The interior is hemorrhaging people, and in some places it has just become simple unsustainable, with whole villages just empty of people
While at the same time, life in Lisbon and to a minor extent Porto, as become hellish, with too many people for too little infrastructure
The problem is exacerbated by our over-centralized form of government, that always puts the needs of the Lisbon (and to a much minor extent Porto) ahead of everyone else
Rural exodus is and has been the usual run of things around here, for quite some time, now
There are many villages in the countryside suffering from serious desertification
There's even so much as ghost villages, that have been abandoned altogether
Depends, if u are rich city asshole, u go live in a village and be an asshole when a village has village stuff (church bell, dogs barking, chickens clucking, geese, cow and horse shit)
If u are a normal person u will either stay in your town if it's close enough to a city, or move to the city
>Expand Lisbon to cover the rest of the country
To some extent that is happening
The Lisbon metropolitan area is getting bigger and bigger, with people commuting from farther and farther away, sometimes on our decrepit rail-road 1950's infrastructure
People spend sometimes more than on third of their work week commuting, it is a huge burden for everyone
Personally I prefer the approach of allocating new services to the interior of Portugal for example in Fundão you now have some IT services with offices there and call centres instead of only having it on Lisbon which is kind of impossible to have a good life quality as the rents are higher and even the quality for children to grow up it’s not as good
I know people who will disagree but if you have grew up in a village and you know close people who grew up in a big city you will understand that ok they had more tools to learn, library’s museum’s all this cultural life that you hadn’t, but for me I always traveled to this kind of places in school trips but at the end of the day I had more freedom to play in the street, go to my friends place and nicer close bondings with family then them
The only problem is when you get to university level and/or start to look for jobs small towns have nothing similar to the amount of offers and different areas like Lisbon and Porto
While not exactly what you're asking, I really do feel uneasy seeing people at the beach put their towels right next to cliffs despite there being prevalent signage warning against that
There've been quite a few incidents in which parts of said cliffs have broken and fallen on people
Similarly, a lot of people ignore those signs when trying to take photos at the top of those same cliffs, which has resulted in some deaths
It is not really a sign, but when you get weather warnings or interdictions to go to beaches or coastal roads over "coastal" events, the size of the waves can be a bit scary
On the mainland I think I have never seen prediction of waves taller than 20 meters, but on weather forecasts the Azores sometimes get weather warnings of waves from 20 to 30 meters
Not something you want to encounter, LOL, anywhere, particularly at the place the wave breaks
Not only for photos
People like to climb or go down cliffs to get a nice fishing spot
Many, oh so many, people have died or gone missing like that
Yet they just keep doing it
And yes, there are signs, warnings and even chains around those areas
And now I'm reminded of the kids that go those spots (as well as bridges and docks) just so they can dive off them to the water
It just makes me feel unneasy
Never heard of rugby players, teams or games in Portugal in my entire life, even if there is some popularity, rugby would still be completely overshadowed by football
, shit's wild here
Football/Soccer overshadows every other sport
Our prime minister even said that hosting the UCL final is a prize for all the healthcare workers
Even tho Rugby was also called Rugby Football (I think), it has virtually minimum attention, especially compared to the other Football
Portugal national team it's called "Os Lobos" (wolfs) and it's a sport that's supported/played essential by a universitarie elite
It's beyond a lot of other sports in popularity of the main population
It is overshadowed by football, but, compared to all the other sports, it has some popularity in Portugal, specialy in Lisbon
In Lisbon, there are a lot of teams, some of them conected to the universitys, like Direito, Técnico, CDUL, etc; other owned by football clubs, like Sporting and Belenenses
Some teams are already professional
It is considered a sport played by betos, that, according to the dictionary is preppy in english
To me, the stereotype is that rugby is a sport played by the rich people, by the "betos de Cascais"
In Coimbra it's very well known too
And it was a big thing when we reached the world cup
We played it in highschool too
Oh I didn't know
Maybe it's just me who isn't open to the rugby world in Portugal then
UHT treated milk, in tetra pack air-tight packages only needs to be put on the fridge after it is open
It will last 6 months or so out of it
"Fresh" milk which tastes nicer is supposed to always be kept refrigerated
Our climate is too warm and there is this cultural thing about milk products  going bad (brucelliosis
) and dangerous if not refrigerated all the time, apart from cheese obviously
Eggs do not need to be refrigerated and never are on the market circuit
But once they are refrigerated they need to be kept refrigerated always (because condensation will wash off the bloom and they became more porous and permeable to infection from environmental pathogens) and they keep fresher if they are refrigerated so after purchase I usually keep them in the fridge
Eggs aren't refrigerated in the supermarket, but we put them in the fridge anyway
We buy UHT milk and don't refrigerate it most of the year
In the summer, we always keep one litre in the fridge
Why would you put eggs on the refrigerator
They don’t go bad and you don’t need them cold since  most of us don’t eat them raw
Thank you man, really detailed, just one question, are industrial sold eggs never refrigerated during packing or transporting
Is this a "global" thing
It is an European thing
Eggs are not washed and as such are not refrigerated
Chlorine Washed chicken is another thing
It is a matter of regulation imposing stricter higiene rules in chicken farms because things can not Be disguised or made compliant by washing eggs or chlorine washing meat
Might be a climate thing
In Denmark when moving refrigerated eggs to home fridge likely it might not condensate and wash off the egg cuticle too much because it is not hot enough
But in summer anything I buy refrigerated is all damp when I get it home
I never drank milk without it being UHT
It's the most common here in Portugal
Same in Portugal
In the old days they use to persuade you to eat it all and was considered disrespect if you didn't.
Nowadays its actually encouraged by the waiters / restaurant owners if they see you left some food on the plate
Except if it is a fancy restaurant
It depends on the restaurant
If it's a fancy restaurant you wouldn't ask for the leftovers I'd say and the portions tend to be smaller so there's probably no need for that but if you go to a "normal" restaurant the portions are huge
I'm a small girl, I don't eat that much so I either ask for half a portion when that's available or I'm definitely taking the leftovers home
Even if I don't eat them myself I give them to my dog
I hate to waste food
It's not, you can take it home if you want, i've done it a few times
I just don't notice it being very usual for people to do so here, maybe because they make sure to ask for the right portion when they order the food
Interesting
"Mesa Galega" means to finish the entire served meal over here (dishes and serving plates)
Portuguese [QWERTY layout] it has an extra dedicated Ç key, in the same place where the Spanish layout has the Ñ key
I use the Portuguese layout, which is basically QWERTY with an extra key for ç. We also have the tilda (~) and other accents like the ones in á and à.
QWERTY with the accents á, à, â and ã, plus ç since ç is superior c
Funny enough, there was actually a Portuguese layout in the time of type writters
either that or we used the French(?) AZERTY, don't remember
Althought there are tons of Roman ruins and Roman cities (Braga, Coimbra, etc) and of course our Latin culture (and as an extra the river Lima in the north also has a interesting story as a Roman legion passing by thought it was the mythical river that made anyone who crossed it lose their memory, so the Roman general had to cross alone and call every soldier by name to prove it wasn't true), but I would say we are far from the proudest descendants of Rome when it comes to the Latin world, as our Lusitanian descendance and the myths of the Lusitani leader Viriato who defendend his people against the Romans until being ultimately betrayed by his own bribed men are all more engraved in our cultural identity
I'd say
I remember learning history in elementary school ( they basically devided it in the invasions: Celtiberians, Romans, Germans, Arabs, reconquista, independance
) And when we learned about the Romans there was more of a Lusitanian pov, "the hardest people to conquer by the Romans", basically the gauls in Asterix
And then we have Luís Vás de Camões, a very influential Portuguese poet (the day of Portugal is based on his birthday
or death
I don't remember) and in his lifework epic Os Lusiadas(Luso, Lusitanian) he spoke for the abandonment of the Greek and Roman heroes of the respective Greek and Roman epics and for the endorsment of the new heroes of Portugal, aka Vasco da Gama, a main character of his epic
All that and of course Luso literally meaning Portuguese descent clearly shows the impact both Romans and the Lusitanians had in Portugal
So I'd say our best bros Spain
them or Greece
I’d say we were pretty well romanized from top to bottom, every major town/city has some sort of Roman legacy and there are several remnants from that time, mostly well preserved and protected
They were a huge empire and civilization, I can’t say that wasn’t cool and they made some pretty impressive stuff as well
Man what I wouldn’t give to see how my home town was back then
I do this
I honestly don't give a shit
I'm human, you're human
I have a baby, I want him to see outside, see that there's an entire world waiting for him, and closed curtains don't do that
>That the Swiss are bat shit crazy about "privacy" but are completely fine disclosing everything under the sun to rent an apartment
Do they have a choice
What you are listing seems pretty normal for a portuguese landlord to ask prospective tennants, and a guaranteer at that
it is really hard to evict a tennant even for non payment, so at least honest landlords (those who give out legal contracts and receipts, those who are not planning ilegal evictions) will be paranoid about who they are renting to
The landlord is giving the tennant acess to something very expensive and where they can do lots of damage
Your first 2 points can easily be solved by tile floors
No problem with water whatsoever and takes 30 seconds to mop them down every other day
But I guess it's not fun having tile when your winter temps go negative
> Kitchens are already bad enough with a dishwasher, ever having the danger of spewing out the water and destroying the kitchen floor (20-30k renovation
what kitchen floors do you have
You are talking about wood right
that is a big mistake, big, it is very rare here kitchen floors are not hardwearing ceramic
So you put the washing machine, which might spill, on the same place as the dishwasher which might spill, as the fridge who might defrost and drip and so on
>Cash is just way too dangerous,
where are you now
Finland or outside
I am really not afraid of being mugged, and I am in Lisbon and extra paranoid on tourist-y places
But if you avoid the tourists and the scum which preys on them (disguised as other tourists), not particularly afraid of being mugged or pickpocketed
>Why would it be tacky
It would be wasteful if it would just be thrown out, no
it is up to the host to decide
They usually try to make people take leftovers with them, and sometimes it is more fun, because you bring bits of different leftovers, not just what you brought
About the booze, even in universities, bringing back what you brought, or not sharing what you brought, it would be a big anti-social thing
People would say nothing, but you would be seen a selfish rude person
Titus, get the cross
>But a lot of times the regie requires the current tenant to collect the dossiers (documents) on behalf of them
ah, ok, I understand
In case tennant is leaving early or it is the tennant responsability to find a replacement
Yeah, it is weird
And housing seems insanely competitive indeed, probably worse there but I think it is becoming insanely difficult in most of Europe
And it is not just about money, but fear of noise, or anti-social behaviour in general
It is really interesting how some cultural differences affect things which seem so subtle and free choice like where to put washing machines
If I lost my wallet, it would cost me lots of money anyway to replace all the documents on it, and a lot of fuss
It is the cash which would worry me more
I see about the tiles then, on unheated houses and such
I suppose you can winterize empty houses by draining water and sewer pipes
and we do not really heat houses, as a whole, every hour in winter, electricity bills also
>Replacing the documents and cards would be covered by insurance here
Do you have ID cards
Because here they are not mailing a duplicate of an ID card just on say so, you need to go pick it up or request it somewhere where they can check your biometrics
Also banks and stuff they usually are not that happy to send duplicated of credit cards without your physical signature and such
I think my point is, take care of your wallet, it is not just the money
>Empty house
I don't think such a thing exists in Finland
summer cabins
there are lots of those, right
Are they lived in throughout winter
It is weird you are so afraid of losing money and think it is unsafe but are not afraid of identity theft or abuse
I am not particularly worried about the cash or other stuff I carry, but I try to be very careful with my cards and ID
>95 % of the summer cabins we have don't have any water, electricity or such
ok, then only some of then
somebody gets a duplicate, or a new issue of a credit card in your name, and uses to do internet shopping on international sites for things which are used very fast or untraceable
That will cost money to somebody
Your own finnish ID card will likely be valuable on itself, as proof of citizenship for an illegal migrant , particularly elsewhere in Europe where nobody can judge if they speak finnish or act finnish or look finnish (sami people are finnish as well)
In Portugal a woman won a case when the company fired her without notifying her and that specific shit happened
They had to rehire her
Our current Prime Minister and the Socialist party allied with Communists and left wing extremists to remain in power
Does the people from the northern countries perceive tanned people as "not-healthy"?
I'm from Portugal and people here tend to consider tanned people "more healthy", saying things like "you got that nice summer look on you".
Does the reverse happen in the north
Although I tend to find tans aesthetically pleasing, I do always find it worrying when my friends say stuff like "I'm so WHITE
" despite them already being naturally olive-skinned
I also hate how my grandparents kind of pressure me to go out and get a tan like it's supposed to be something healthy
And despite thinking the obsession with tanning and not being careful around the sun to be a bigger problem with people from the UK, that's not to say that Portuguese don't underestimate what the sun does to their skin
You can always spot people at the beach with skin peeling off their shoulders for instance, as well as people who are clearly overtanned and look much older than they actually are
I think that regardless of skin tone people should really be careful with the sun and what it can do to your skin
The peeps from your country and others from the north only burn in here
Once some sweeds came to my grandads factory and had to go to the hospital after going to the beach
Here in Portugal we call Brits lobsters :D
Edit: and camones, which is a slang portuguese word twisted from “c‘mon”
Uv light does not necessarily only cause damage, it can also cause the synthesizing of vitamin d and is very important hormonally
Further melanin is itself repairing of anti oxidants on skin
It is all a balance but there is no risk 0 and sunlight is essential to human health
yeap
I'd say above the Alps everyone is a northerner
Dude, I'm Portuguese and I've had 2nd and even 3rd degree burns from the sun
I've literally bled from the tip of my ears from the sun
I can somewhat relate
Because of my celtic genes from my mum's side I'm more susceptible to getting sunburnt compared to my friends
I very rarely get sunburnt past noon, but if I'm not careful I can get a sunburn before that
This happened to me when I went to Rome, as my friends and I walked a lot from morning to night, and by the end of the trip I noticed that I had a slightly red farmer's tan despite it only being May
Meanwhile my friends looked no different
It also pisses me off how my dad can spend like 30 min max outside in the sun everyday and in four days he's already quite tan
Meanwhile I need to spend considerably more time out in the sun if I want to look noticeably darker
For us northern Portuguese it's probably 35ºC.
I like how you say up here
OK, people getting burnt yhea, but like that it's just when I went to Évora or Algarve
Some of my worst sunburns were during cloudy days
I actually got sunburnt one day last July despite it having rained
It's taught me that I really can't take any chances being outdoors before noon in the summer
After that I tend to be fine however
It does not have to 6 hours but your color can and does change witH very normal wintertime exposition
A big way to tell foreigners is they arrive in summer with no tan and burn but say Finns who live year round can have a decent color by March or so and do not get red or burn from normal sun exposure
And maligning sun exposure itself is not healthy, nevermind vitamin d or other effects, it can be Fantastic for your well being to process sunlight
That was here in the North
Then again, I’m a ginger
But isn't south African and Portuguese climate similar
Well in my opinion almost all accents are disappearing slowly in Portugal and becoming more and more like the standard one which is a shame
I feel like younger people are speaking with less and less accent but I'm not really sure if its 100% true
Standard accent is spoken between Lisbon and Coimbra and it's used in all media radio tv etc
and it's the way I speak
I like all accents and think that they should be preserved
The funniest and seen more like low class is maybe form interior and beira alta
The Minho and Porto accents are seen more rude, and posh one maybe from cascais idk if everyone speaks like that there but it's really annoying
I also want to know your opinion since you are also Portuguese
Depends, some make fun about each other, for example if you from the north or the archipelagos or other places and go to Lisbon, they make fun of you, specially if you're a kid at highschool for example, they look at you like an outsider because they (from Lisbon) never go out from that region
Even there you have a lot of misconceptions about the North and vice versa and because of that sometimes people are seen has stupid
On TV usually in every point you got a "south wash" actors that are from the North and other regions with an accent usually have to "forget" the accent for acting things or for the news or stuff like that because having a different accent is like being lower class
But little by little things are changing, but still have the tendency to uniformize the language
I think there isn't much of a posh accent
I think our islands deserve a mention, they are incredibly hard to understand, and even each island within the same archipelago has its own accent, with the S.Miguel one probably the hardest to understand
Beiras is probably looked down upon the most
Our south has some nice ones too
Lisbon people insist they don't have an accent, but while it isn't as obvious as the northern one it's definitely there (like Lesboa instead of Lisboa)
I think the beiras accent is slowly disappearing as people from the interior move to study
Accents vary across the Minho, though I personally can't tell them apart
I went to university in Covilhã and everyone asked if I was from Famalicão because of my accent
I didn't even know Famalicão had an accent
Anyway, I'm from Braga
I'm from Cascais, the accent is a meme in the sense that there's barely anyone that talks like that
We have the typical Lisbon accent
I only met 1 person in my life that has the stereotypical Cascais valley girl accent
It's mostly played up for laughs or by those "tias" on tv for attention
In fact it's so rare, that when I met that lady for the first time I did a double take because I thought she was trolling me
You know what's not rare
People making a shitty impression of a Cascais accent when they met someone from Cascais
I laugh everytime (not really)
I agree with you in everything
Not at all
I've done it many times in the past and never got any weird looks or comments
It's not uncommon to see people eating alone at restaurants here
Yeah
Its pretty common to see business people, lawyers, construction workers (everyone basically) eating alone in their lunch break
Yes, eating could be considered a social activity, but just because you’re sitting alone in a table at a tasca/restaurante doesnt mean you’re “alone”. People here talk a lot to other costumers, but specially to the waiters
And even more if its a place you go everyday/often
Hmmm I love tascas
Nope, it would be highly illegal especially at Constitutional and penal level
It doesn't surprise me you guys still have it
Bounty hunters
What
That's something I thought only existed in fiction
You Americans and your strange shit
Back when Portugal was a dictatorship and very poor, people used to starve and seldom have access to proper meat
So they would come up with creative ways of cooking leftovers
So there's things like eating fish eyes, lamb's brain, animals intestines, etc
Another example is "Roupa Velha", which is a kind of soup made with leftover veggies from another meal
"Tired horse soup", or sopas de cavalo cansado in Portuguese
A soup made of red wine (tinto), pieces of bread (broa), and sugar that poor people, including children would eat to keep them warm, especially in the cold winters and also to give them an energy boost for the work day
Used to be common back then
All anyone eats north of the Alps is meat, cabbage and potato
I've only ever heard of "roupa velha"/"farrapo velho" as a new dish using Christmas' leftovers (with the codfish meal, not the meat meals)
This makes me want to try it
Really great to guarantee your child’s cognitive functions are permanently limited
Yes
You're right
I meant that soup made with Cozido à Portuguesa leftovers
That's not called Roupa Velha
My bad
But the intention is the same
By reading some of the comments I think the term "Roupa Velha" (old clothes) is a kind of common umbrella Iberian name for "a dish made with what's left". People do it differently; the essence is that it is a dish intended on not throwing food away
Latino countries probably inherited the concept
I eat it quite often actually
Bacalhau com Natas, Pastéis de Bacalhau and Boiled with potatoes most often
I guess it depends from person to person
Some people eat more fish than others, and those, like me, that eat plenty of fish usually go for Bacalhau(cod) because it can be better preserved and cooked in multiple ways
The other fish lose a lot of their quality if they are not consumed the day they were caught
So cod fish is more like a convenience, I guess, that's why's so popular
Edit: another advantage of cod fish meals is that they can be stored as leftovers or stored to eat later, even cold
Kinda like tuna actually
For me it's something I have every so often, usually in a family gathering or lunch/dinner with friends
I recomend looking into r/Portugal for better answers about bacalhau
16 cultural 1 natutal
15 with photos and location
We have 17 sites and 19 sites expecting classification
Here's the list
Open list of sites
A while back in /r/portugal people were posting [francesinhas] they'd come across in different places and thus there were debates on what exactly counts as a proper francesinha
I think all can agree that the best ones you can only get in Porto
There was a similar trend of people posting pics of pasteis de nata that they'd come across in different countries, but that was more to do with the sacrilege and how wrong they were making them
There's also the [Super Bock] vs [Sagres] debate, but I and most people I know prefer Super Bock
Speaking of which there's also the debate between *Imperial* and *Fino*, both names used to describe [this] Whatever you call it usually depends on what part of the country you're from
What we call to a portuguese pint [Fino vs
Imperial ]
It's clearly fino and everyone who says the contrary is a heathen
(the quantity of it isn't actually a pint, not using the word pint to measure quantify)
Two main discussions: I will present the issue and then give my opinion on the topic
1st) when you drink milk with cereals what do you put first, cereals or milk
In my opinion, we should put the milk first mainly if you want to put it in the microwave first, but there are many people who put cereals first
2nd) should we put pinneaple on pizza
This is kind of an international issue and I think most of portuguese people are against it
Pizza is a meal, pinneaple is a fruit that you may eat as a dessert
Pizza is good, pinneaple is good, both together are shit
If it makes you feel good, we call it Panike - which i have no idea where it comes from buuut its a larger and delicious version of pain au chocolat/chocolatine
Also, it can have egg cream filling instead of chocolate
Ok, first of all, everyone knows the best francesinha is in Taberna Belga in Braga
Secondly, the North stays strong with fino all the way
A melhor Francesinha é a do Capa Negra no Porto
e Super Bock >>>>
Quanto ao imperial vs fino, imperial é dos lisboetas, que chamam ténis a sapatilhas, chapéus de sol a guarda-sol, bica a café (cimbalino
), cadeados a aloquetes, cabide a cruzeta, etc etc
resposta correta: fino, claro está!
Idk what either one of them is but, for us is codfish all the way
PS: sorry for consuming so much codfish, it's an addiction at this point
It's a bit confusing for someone (starting) learning greek and loving gyros
No wonder you guys have so many civil wars
You can find Super Bock in some British supermarkets
And pasteis de nata can be found in some coffee shops like Costa's!
My bad, have only been to Braga twice and haven't had a francesinha there
Will keep a note of it
Vou acrescentar à lista de francesinhas que tenho de provar ;)
Cá na minha região também chamamos uma cerveja imperial, mas de resto não usamos muitos nomes/termos lisboetas
Não consigo chamar carcaça a um papo-seco
Excuse me, did you just put peppers in salada russa
Hahahah não me lembrava da carcaça! xD
It's already in the same in both Portuguese and English, so i wouldn't change anything
Not a lot of countries have the same name in english vs native language
So, we cool
Fun fact: that name root is the same for Wallonia - the french speaking part of Belgium - which us the old germanic word “walls” meaning, as you’ve pointed out, “foreigners”.
I think there are other regions in Europe with similar names in english and german, but I can’t remember them right now
P.S. how do you read cymru
Is is like “Kumru”? It sounds badass but I’m not sure I say it right
Funnily enough "Peru" is what we call a turkey in Portuguese
In Portuguese we call Latvia "Letónia", which honestly I think makes it easier to mix you up with Lithuania
Here, Portugalia is the name of a restaurant chain and the name of an Airline xD
Edit: words
A bit for me, "galia" makes me remember "Gaul", which was France at a certain point, but still derives from Celtic, so
Changing it to Poortugahl wouldn't help our name
&#x200B;
Lusitânia would be cool though, but they don't know how to pronounce the nasal sound and the word is from way before the kingdom started
You can just force people and release a hit song about it
Sweetzen because of swiss chocolate
Going for the Côte d'Ivoire approach, I see
England means "land of the Angles", an old Germanic tribe
It's kind of different, Angles united with Saxons who were a majority, they only started being english after the kingdom was established, and they are more descendant from saxons than angles
(at least that is what I remember from history)
I like a lot of Japanese names, but I obviously could never name a kid of mine that
I don't plan on having kids anyway, so it doesn't matter
I've always loved the names Jason and Cian
I think Ragnar sounds pretty cool
Pelo amor de Deus, não chames Naruto ao puto
Carlos' pretty popular here in Portugal
That's basically the entire population of Portugal
My parents let me choose my little brother's name, I picked Luís Miguel

O nome do puto foi Son Goku da Silva
So here the opinion is that Normally big brands sell those cheaper as normally they have less quality and are giant billboards, So it's considered tacky where I'm from, and I'd never go outside with that type of shirt
In my school they'd use to make fun of people that would wear that type of thing too
In the UK it feels a bit more acceptable but still you don't see it that often
In the rest of South Europe in my experience it's rare
I feel that you can maybe see it slightly more in Italy and they're more accepted here as people are more fashion/brand oriented then in other countries I've lived in, but you still don't see them much
Ps: I'm taking about the ones with gigantic logo on them, not the ones with a little one at the top left
And this may vary hugely based on regions
I personally don't like clothing with logos, save if the logo is very very small, because then you're just a walking advertisement
But yeah, that's absolute BS, Europeans wear clothing with logos, we get the same shirts from third world sweat shops that Americans do
I think these days they're not really in vogue
I don't really like them apart from athleisure (because most of the time they're kept small)
But I remember during the mid-2000s I only wore graphic tees and clothing with logos
Not sure if this is still the case, but I remember white Levi t-shirts were worn by everyone during the summer
Never really understood why
I think his friend probably meant how big and visible the logos are, I used to wear American streetwear when I was younger and those tend to have huge logos specially t-shirts and while most clothing in Europe does have visible logos they normally are small
Most t-shirts from brands like Elements and Hurley have huge logos stamped on them
The United Kingdom
Growing up, british culture was just everywhere and it was great
Great comedies, great musicians
Great looking cities
I even went there in 2009 and loved it
But ever since then Britain has done a beautiful job at making it look like a shithole
Crime rates rising to all hell
Ridiculous free speech restrictions
I always knew the weather was shit but everything else ruined the country for me
Plus I had 2 of my friends go live there for 2-3 years and they both came back despite making much more money there, they came back depressed and soulless
This has nothing to do with brexit
I had this view way before brexit, and tbh, whilst I'm not against the EU I feel like brexit was a good wake up call
When I was a kid I assumed Italy was full of crazy ferrari drivers and tasty pizza
Then I finally went to Italy when I was 12
and it was nothing like that
I grew up watching a lot of 80's and 90's tv shows and movies and the UK was always depicted with weird sounding people who are nice or drunk, great sounding cars, great wits and the country fields and villages reminiscing of a harsher but simpler time
Also, funny looking bobbies and Thatcher Thatcher Milk Snatcher
Now
It's a messed up place with messed up people with messed up laws and ideas that should not be
I have kind of a romantic view on your country
Please don't let me down
Thank you for loving our language
You are asking a very general question here
At least in Portugal there are multiple origins of surnames
I have some experience in genealogy, and the surnames in Portugal have only become "stable" in the second half of the XIX  century
You have multiple origins:
* like in the Slavic and Scandinavian countries you have patronymics, like Rodrigues (son of Rodrigo), Gonçalves (son of Gonçalo), Pires (which originally was Peres i.e. son of Pedro), etc ... However these are old patronymics, that have been running for at least a century and a half
* You have place names like Gouveia, Almeida
Which posh people generally add the "de" before (or extra posh " d' ")  (like the Dutch "van" or the German "von")
* You have nicknames that became surnames, especially (but not exclusively) in the south of Portugal, like Ganhão, Ortigão
* Professions like Ferreira (from Ferreiro=blacksmith)
* Plant names like Oliveira, Figueira, Pereira
* Animal names like Leitão, Coelho, Cordeiro
* Religious related names like Assis, Santos  (dos Santos (meaning "from the angels") generally means that there was an orphan abandoned and taken by the church, like the Italian Esposito in the Naples region)
There are obviously thousands more, if you are more specific in your request I can give you a hand coming up with a Portuguese sounding name
That isn't very common in the portuguese language, sure the are do/dos/das between the first and middle name that mean "of" but it's very rare
"d'" if you live in Cascais, "de" if you're rich, and "do/da" if you're poor
:')
EDIT: What about names with colours, like Branco or Roxo
Those are also somewhat common
I need to do my family tree and find out who was an orphan
I sense some dark past but at the same time I feel like it was common at the time
I was scrooling down looking for these
ahah I was thinking The same
my Mother has a cousin who os a Damous lawyer and he added a t to is name, double t now, much more relevant
I'm from Cascais and I don't have a "d'" or even a "de". People from Cascais have a bad reputation because of a small crowd, that really aren't from Cascais
Unfortunately it  was very common
On my research I've found several cases on my family tree
One of which as a son of an unknown mother, i.e. the father was known but the mother was unknown, which sounds a little confusing, The matter was that they weren't married, and didn't live together
Later on, via an older cousin, that had received from her grandmother which was the grand-daughter of the "unknown" lady, I was able to find her name
But even worse is reading the parish death records, there are times where all the records on both pages are of children
My parents share the same surname and since over here it's customary to name the child with the last surname from each parent, they deemed it ok to name me Surname e (and) Surname
The only thing that's annoying about it is the expectation that you're supposed to know the language
Doesn't apply to me, but I have seen people get annoyed when someone doesn't speak English
It's why I find it amusing to see countries like Japan not give a fuck about English and force people to actually put some effort in trying to communicate when they travel there
It can also be annoying to see signs and whatnot only in English
Agai,n I personally don't have a problem with this (in terms of understanding what's written that is), but it excludes people who don't know the language
At least English is a relatively simple language to grasp
It has several inconsistencies, but at least there aren't a hundred different ways to conjugate a verb
Yes, because they fucking pulled the pink map on us
No, not at all
Well yes and no
It depends, but in general its not annoying or bad per say
The benefits are obviously the simplicity and easy learning of the language are great, a lot situations are more easy to deal
No offence intended to the following, but for example French has a lot of speakers but when it comes to learn it, it's a nightmare at least from my perspective has a non native French speaker, in school i barely learn the language because it was hard (I'm also dyslexic but in comparison English was extremely easy to learn and become fluent)
My language, Portuguese is also hard to learn, but not has hard in comparison to French
I would like to see my own language become more popular yes, because Portuguese is spoken by a lot of people around the world and Portuguese is a beautiful language (not biased at all /s  xP)
English anyone's me when certain words that already exist in Portuguese start to be replaced by English terms, it becomes really annoying, if the term already exists in our language why bring a English term when we already have that word, its total understandable if the term or word doesn't exist in our language and use an English term that everyone or almost everyone knows has a fix for the lack of a term but why use it when we already have the bloody word
This is the only major thing that annoying about English
Sorry to the French, no offence is intended to your language but bloody hell it's really hard xP again sorry
This is honestly the best comment in this thread
The English native speakers privilege is a very real thing and most people aren't even aware of that
We shall speak British English by the order of the peaky fookin blinders
I fully understand you
As a Portuguese it's sad to see the dominance of Brazilian Portuguese, the worst is using the Brazilian flag when referring to Portuguese, at least use Brazilian Portuguese and the flag
But it's completely normal
Might just be the types of tourists that travel to my region, but I've definitely witnessed it
It doesn't happen all the time, but it does happen
Use it wisely my friend
Nowadays no, and unless they get a new crazy dictator somehow in the future, I think we're pretty good
well, other than when it comes to football, I think Spain and Portugal are pretty good
Well Spain didn't invade us for about 400 years, so I think we're good
They have their own problems to care about and I think Portugal isn't one of them
Edit: I admit I'm just here to read about the balcans
Spain, we good
Otherwise, only need to worry about sea-level rise
Depends on which ideology or kings are reigning there
I mean we also have Azores and Madeira that Wikileaks confirmed that USA (Nixon IIRC) wanted to take it from us
We never knew this until now
What would it happen if Trump tried to take lets say Ibiza from Spain, Azores from Portugal or Greenland from Denmark
Don't worry, we will just call the Baker woman of Aljubarrota, she is basically the doom slayer
"Rip and tear every Spaniards until its done
" ~ Baker woman of Aljubarrota probably
Fellow Portuguese stop looking at how others live their lifes and what they have a go get it for yourself, we are better than we think we are
Hey, at least you're not in the same group as Germany and France, you're saved from that embarrassment that Portugal is probably going to feel
Our accent is terrible but most young people can hold conversations in English and older people, despite not having any education in English whatsoever, can understand a word here or there
I think that has a lot to do with movies, since there is a bigger exposure to English, it becomes easier to learn if you want it
But don't forget, Portuguese is not only spoken in Portugal
It is a big language indeed
I know some things about Morocco from history classes, and a bit about Carthage too
But other than that, not that much
I spent two weeks in Tunisia in the 90s. I remember it being beautiful, and tourist friendly
There were beautiful beaches with warm water and white sand, some well preserved monuments and museums
The people was friendly
Because I stayed some time I got to travel to the edge of the Sahara, stay the night at an oasis and spend the dawn in desert the dunes
Even by the standards of my poor south European country they were poor
Everything is to be haggled in Morocco and offering to trade a woman for camels is a gag they run on tourists
I don't much else, which is a shame since Morocco is the 3rd closes country to Portugal
Them's fighting words, buddy

Has the movie "Home Alone" accidentally become a Christmas tradition in your country
Alternatively,  or if not, what other pieces of media  does everyone experiences every year
I perfer watching die hard around Christmas, at least personal tradition
Does anyone else have the same here
Home alone and love actually are always on TV around x-mas times
Yes, and lord of the rings on New Year’s Eve
Harry Potter and The Lord Of The Rings
At least where I live, back In the 90s and early 2000s every year we saw it on tv an we were like "God damn it
Not home alone again
But now we embrace it has a tradition
This year it's on as usual and  everyone is watching it because it became a nostalgic thing we do on Christmas
Beethoven used to be very popular too,  but then it just stopped
I cant remember the last time I saw it
Literally the same thing here in Portugal
Labregos
Azeiteiros
In Porto: Gunas
In Lisbon: Xungas
Portugal has alentejanos
In the Netherlands we used to call them "Asos" as well, but this was back in the 90's.
Azeiteiros tb é uma boa descrição
Ruras também
Não me ofendas crl que eu faço azeite, ó seu azeiteiro
Ou então labregos azeiteiros do caralho que não metem pisca e deitam restos de comida pela janela
Bónus: pessoal que deita o saco do lixo pela janela (num prédio)
e os gunas
Não?
Yes, in Portugal we have/use the word "chunga" and "chungaria", which pretty much means "worthless"
nunca vi deitarem sacos do lixo pela janela, felizmente, mas sim, seria coisa de azeiteiro
Isto é discutível mas não é o grupo que é olhado com mais sobranceria pelo resto da população os "avecs"? Esses em geral são os mais azeiteiros dos labregos
Deitar seria jogar o saco de lixo pela janela
Sim, exatamente
Even with the rock starting to come, probably Light Music was really popular in the 70's since the dictatorial regime supported it to go to Eurovision Song Contest because the lyrics in general had the requirements needed to never using censorship, even if people used metaphors to describe situations that happened that time
What marks the end of dictatorship, still on the Light Music was ["Depois do Adeus" performed by Paulo de Carvalho and written by José Calvário] that went once again to ESC
On the same period marked "Música de Intervenção" translated is Intervention Music that were music about the end of the dictatorial regime and one of the ones who marked it was ["Grândola Vila Morena" by Zeca Afonso (Zeca is a common nickname for José)] and if you hear it uses a traditional type of music called Cante Alentejano, that was recently considered Unesco Immaterial Heritage
After that, at the end of the 70's beginning 80's started rock strongly with [Xutos e Pontapés] [GNR] or [Heróis do Mar]
What marked the 80's too was [Amália Rodrigues' Fado]
Another ones you can hear from this time period [Madredeus] and [António Variações]
>at the end of the 70's beginning 80's started rock strongly with Xutos e Pontapés, GNR or Heróis do Mar
While great representatives of Portuguese Rock of that time, not mentioning Rui Veloso, [UHF] or [Taxi] who were probably the first artists to appear is a sin
;) The song ["Chico Fininho"] by Rui Veloso, is even considered the song that inaugurated that period
>What marked the 80's too was Amália Rodrigues' Fado
Maybe I've been all my life wrong, but I was completely under the impression that fado was pretty much shunned in the 80's and 90's because of its connection to the dictatorship (not that the songs or the artists were themselves apologists of it, but the genre itself was heavily promoted by the regime)
Fado has only been revived in the early 2000's with the new generations, headed by [Mariza]
Madredeus is more 90's than 80's, but still a great band nonetheless, if you're into their style
[António Variações] is indeed from the 80's and not known enough internationally
**EDIT:** Just to add [this amazing song] from the 70's Intervention music period, by Sérgio Godinho
Thank you for adding more, I named just a few
True, you know that some artists made albums out of the country, generally at France to then come back and sell them undercover
That's funny :)
Never heared that band btw but thank you for your recommendation :)
[Here an archive of Petrus Castrus] in fact they're from the 70's
If you're interested in Portuguese prog rock you have to check out José Cid's 1978 album "10 000 anos depois entre Vénus e Marte" - [ \- imo the best portuguese album of all time
I think only after the dictatorship went down, because all music had to be inspected to see if had some stuff that weren't aloud to have in music, but I'm not sure
I'm sure at the 80's started to enter more and some made teenage and adult memories of a lot of people
A fun fact:
Did you know that Carmen Miranda was portuguese
She went to Brazil when she was 10 months old
More fado singers I can name and remember is Carlos do Carmo, Celeste Rodrigues (sister of Amália), Camané, Ana Moura, Carminho (appeared on Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations), Cuca Roseta, Cristina Branco, Gisela João, Katia Guerreiro, Raquel Tavares, Dulce Pontes, Mafalda Arnauth and more
Some of the ones that I send you don't sing exclusively fado, but great part of them do
If someone remembers more, comment :)
You're welcome, it's great to see other people interested in Portuguese music
I while ago, I compiled [a short YouTube playlist] of songs from that 80's rock period
It's obviously very incomplete, but I feel it's a good way to get a sense of what mainstream Portuguese rock was during the 80's (the whole period is even called the "Portuguese Rock Boom", due to how it exploded in popularity and new bands were popping up every day)
You're welcome mate
It's my pleasure, man
Of the playlist
It's linked in my post, but I'll put here again:

Spoken: 99-100%
Spanish

I can understand spoken Spanish and Galician pretty well 90~% of the time, same with the written forms, although Galician is the easiest since both Portuguese and Galician shared a common language in their roots (Galician-Portuguese)
I understand Italian most of the time when spoken and written although easy is not has easy has the previous languages
French is complicated i can understand a few things from them when spoken, written depends honestly
Romanian i never heard so i can't judge on that, written I'm not sure if i ever saw it, i assume that's a bit more difficult than Italian and easier than French
Spanish have some difficulties understanding us spoke, since Portuguese has more fonectic sounds and we stress vouls in quick manner
I think they have no problem with written
Se quiserem responder nas vossas línguas para ver quão fácil ou difícil é eu aceito o desafio, a menos que não queiram aí podemos falar inglês. A quem a primeira língua não é uma língua das línguas romance mas aprendeu uma gostava de ouvir a vossa opinião na matéria (to whom the first language is not from the romance family but you learn one, i want to hear your opinion on the mater)
I understand Spanish, Catalan, and some Italian and French, I don't understand Romanian at all
As someone who speaks some German I can recognise some Danish/Swedish/Norwegian vocabulary, and ofc my English knowledge helps somewhat too
But no way I can understand full sentences or read articles in those languages
As someone who learns German on their own, I promise you that knowing English helps
Ofc there's no mutual intelligibility between both languages, but it gives you an advantage
Not just in basic vocabulary but also in certain grammatical features as well
Hungarian is probably as similar to Estonian as Portuguese is to German
> So Spanish and French, nothing, i understand a few words hear and there
Portugese i catch more words the the other 2
That's interesting
We're always put in the "can't understand what they say" bin
Listening to Aromanian is also gibberish to me
I wonder why you'd get more Portuguese words than Spanish, though
Is it our slavic-like cadence that's more familiar to you
Online I often see Spanish speakers claiming that Italian is the closest language to Spanish
Either they have never seen Portuguese or the spoken form is too hard for them to understand
And weirder than that is when I see people saying that French is the closest language to Spanish
Brazilian is not a language
Whenever i hear Romanian the only words i can pick up are "Eu" and "Sunt"
How can you understand written Spanish at 50% but Portuguese less than 20%? Don't both languages share like 80% of their vocabulary
That was the point I was trying to make with my analogy
Fire
Either during the Inquisition or currently during wildfires
I don't remember any special way of doing it
During the first republic bombing our politicians
Dictatorship, we would send them to the "fryer" Tarrafal
After the 1974 revolution, we are more polite, exception for the 80s and FP25
Burning at the stake
Ok so Portugal was one of the first countries to abolish the death penalty in Europe, but when the death penalty was allowed the perfer method or the only method used was hanging in terms of the Portuguese law apply by national courts
Now in terms of church courts/inquisition, and the application of the canonical law, applied in Portugal, the perfer method would have probably been the application of torture devices like the jaw breaker, the weele
Etilic Overdose from all the wine
Oh vá lá! Tadinhas das pessoas
Ainda bem que estamos a ter menos incêndios, mas
We did kill a few people during the Inquisition,  mainly by burning them alive
Não estou a gozar com elas, mas antes a ironizar com a horrível situação.
Also the jaw breaker and the weele killed a lot of people
Eu percebi
Também estava só a fazer uma piada com a maneira como construíste a frase
Well, the Portuguese have ease in understanding other Romantic Languages (except French), so in the University you can find foreign Professors lecturing in a sort of Spanish or Italian mixed with some Portuguese vocabulary, and it's ok
It gives excuse for laughs, especially when they say curse words or are overly informal without realising
For English, it depends on the context
Some Professors usually ask: "Are there any students who don't understand Portuguese and prefer English
". This only happens in University
Nope we're pretty stable on that regard
In Portugal, there is the FLA (Frente da Libertação Açoreana) that aims to claim the independence of the azorean islands over continental Portugal
Idk I think they're kinda dumb
I wounder, other than Catalunha, does Galiza have any such movement
(if they do, give us our number, we will welcome them as honorary Portuguese /s (kidding) )
Didn't that movement died out or was unpopular
(genuinely asking, i don't know much about it)
There was also FLAMA, in Madeira, back in the seventies
They had a bombing campaign, and ended when one of the bombs actually killed someone
[Actually
Me, as someone who's family is half catalan, and want independence, believe that catalonia should be independent
They have their own language, their own culture, their own government, their own police, their own economy, wich would be bigger and better if they didn't divide it with Spain
So I would like your opinion on why Catalonia should/shouldn't be independent
[Actually
Oldest consistent boarders (for a European country that's really impressive taking to account the history of the continent) , although there's a controversy with Olivença with Spain
Its complicated but here's a Wikipedia article
It's almost a joke by now, only really old people support it, so it'll disappear in a few years
There is also the prince of Pontinha, who is literally the most active separatist movement in Portugal
Certainly has more media words written about him in the last couple decades
OTOH it is is one man and about 50, 100 square meters of a rock
OLIVENÇA É NOSSA
Weren't they monarchist right wingers or something
>it's pretty stupid, in this day and age, to go around creating new borders and amplifying our differences instead of getting together and cooperate
So and what about Spain joining Portugal under the Portuguese government, would you like that
>all aspects of Catalonian culture are respected and promoted nowadays
Are you sure
The Catalans voted for Carles Puigdemont and he was forced to step down, and that is happening again with Quim Torra, but he is refusing to step down, isn't that oppression
And image if France annexed Spain, would you like to pay taxes to them
Spain annexed Catalonia, Catalonia off course doesn't want to pay anything to they invaders and oppressors, that is a logical though, and I for sure know that a lot of Catalans think that way, including the example of my family
I live on Flores
There's a few old guys in my village that still support this but it's not exactly a hot topic
If they get drunk enough then they might rant about it late night
They're definitely right wing but I've never heard them mention the monarchy
I did a bit of research they aren't monarchsit (idk where I got that idea, might have had confuse some elements of another thing with them, my bad)
So do you think it's something that will eventually die out with the older generations
>Spain is de facto a federal state
The kingdom of Catalonia and Aragon was annexed in the 15th century and has been struggling for independence since, in a federal state, all of the provinces/states in majority agree to be together
Not the case of Catalonia, where the majority wants independence
>He was forced to step down because he made illegal things
Name them
He only did a referendum to see what the people want, and the Spanish civil guard attacked civilians, why aren't they being charged
>Spain did not annex Catalonia
The Crowns of Castile and Aragon entered a personal union and, over time, merged into the same country, called Spain, that has gone through a lot of different governments and ideology
Personal union is annexation, call it what you want
And the interesting part is that through out the different governments and ideologies Catalonia always wanted to be independent, off course specially in the Franco period, where the Catalans were slightly more oppressed than nowadays, btw my grandfather fought on the Spanish civil war on the 2nd republic of Spain side
Acho que sim
>So, he used public resources to do something that was outside its competences
He used Catalan resources to show something most Catalans wanted to be shown, he only made what the  people wanted
>PDC, which seems to be willing to throw the rest of us under the proverbial fascist bus if it befits them
ERC is showing that at least they care about the bigger picture and for that they have my respect
On that I can agree, but note that ERC has much more influence, I don't think PDC is that bad but my ideology indeed identifies more to ERC, which was founded by Lluís Companys, the greatest independent leader of all time
>you can't ignore them just because you feel that more or less the majority of the population wants something
But isn't that, the will of the people the whole point of democracy
Can't laws change
>change the Statute of Autonomy
You mean downgrade it right
Because I really doubt that they can upgrade it
Well, the word "canto" in Portugal could mean a corner or a something singing :v
Security + Safety = Segurança (in portuguese)
We use the word **chão** for *floor* and *ground*
Answering your question the other way around: *levar, tomar, tirar*= to take
In portuguese that doesn't happen very frequently
It more the opposite
Bank and stool/bench
So we have the word banco which dependen on the context can either be a Bank or stool/bench
Eu fui ao Banco
(i went to the bank)
Eu sentei me no banco de jardim (i sat on the guardian bench)
Exactly the same in Portuguese
Same in Portugal
Same with "Banco" either a bank or bench
Oh true :oo
Forgot about that one
Region-city-country
In Portugal you have different regions and with that different traditions and even different ways of living as I have moved around I always mention even with foreign people first my region but I know a few people that do this, most of the people I know identify more city- country
For me it usually goes "City/Region, Country, Southern Europe". When I'm in my Region or city there's usually no need to say I'm from there because people usually get it, from the way I speak and the way I behave in general
But in the capital I'll always present myself as "Algarvio", or just by saying the city I'm from
Overseas I'll say I'm portuguese, and if someone is confused by that (happens more often than one would think), I'll clarify that I'm southern european
I'd say I identify more with my city, as there are more people with lives similar to mine (at least financially I guess)
Same here, Lisbon, Portugal, South Europe and then Europe
I feel alot closer to Italians and Greeks than say Finnish or Slovenians though
I would say it depends on the city or region
If you're from a big city (Lisbon, Porto, Coimbra, etc
) or from the central regions, you're most likely to identify with your city first
If, however, you are from a more traditionally present region (Algarve, Alentejo, Trás-os-Montes, Azores, Madeira, for example) you are more likely to identify with your region
My theory is that, because throughout history, the center of the country has never had a constant regional division, people identity more with their cities
However, elsewhere, regional divisions have more or less stayed the same for centuries, so people are more likely to have a regional identity
I completely agree I would never identify with a region always country and city
Regions in Portugal are a complete mess, if you asked me what was my region I wouldn't know what are you talking about
The historic regions, the districts, the new nuts 2 or nuts 3 regions
If you divide Portugal into regions it would be North, center, Lisbon and Tagus Valley, Alentejo, Algarve, Azores and Madeira
I was thinking more about nut 2, but I see that it can be a bias on my part as I’m from Algarve which for me is one of the regions as the previous comment mentions has kept its identify throughout centuries and for people from Centro that may not be as true for example
Well in school I played a lot with my friends
We'd play the usual games: tag, hide and seek, cops and robbers, etc
plus games we came up with ourselves
At home I'd watch television and would play video games
My dad's always been super into computers and gadgets and so I played a lot of old skool emulators, PS1 and Dreamcast
Had a Game Boy Colour as well
Later I'd get a PS2 and that was probably my most played console as a kid, along with the DS
I was introduced to video games from a very early age and to this day I'm super into them
Not just playing them but their history and how they were developed
Growing neither me or my friends lived in a town, rather we lived in a common geographic area
Our houses weren't walking distance to each other, and so we didn't really meet up in the weekends unless our parents planned a playdate
So as a child I spent a lot of my weekends with my sister at my grandparents' place whilst my parents worked
It was kind of boring there so we were stuck watching the four default Portuguese channels, though at some point I managed to convince my grandparents to let me bring my consoles
Summer holidays were also like that for the most part, but my fondest memories are of the times my parents would send me to "summer camp" where I could actually interact with other children
Also played Tennis for a while
Words that start with an H because in Portuguese H doesn't have a sound so I don't pronounce them I only noticed this when moved to the UK and people told me I was saying "eye school" instead of "high school"
Any word with the "th" sound is particularly hard for me because we don't have anything close to that sound in Portuguese
It's especially tough when sometimes "th" has that sound and sometimes it's another sound entirely, so I always end up guessing
"Squirrel" is a classic, but I struggle many times with the number "three"
I speak Portuguese as first language and those below arw the worst for me:
Beach vs bitch
Sheet vs shit
[Rural, 1:08]
Also: Category
Same here
Going back and forth between s and th is tricky
I can say "something" pretty well, but not "something simple". "something else" has enough of a gap that it's alright again
Maybe because it doesn't exist in Portuguese
Maybe Spaniards don't have that trouble
I really don't see the trouble in that "Sally sells seashells by the seashore", probably because Portuguese is full of s's and sh's.
Soft 'Th' as in "They" or hard 'Th' as in "Think"?
If “queue” is hard, wait until you need to remember how to pronounce “quay”.
Portuguese: Esquilo
That's funny, because in Portugal, some of us do the opposite with the letter D. For example, I want to pronounce the word "Load", but I end up pronouncing it "Loathe".
In that situation, it must be either challenging or funny when someone talks with a lisp and " *ftartf talking like viff* " ahah
It's a Hard Th
Even though I had to think for a second about this one, because it's kind of usual to pronounce it soft, it's supposed to be a hard Th
José Mourinho does that too when he says "I Sink", and many portuguese people make fun of him because we believe it's not that hard to pronounce it
Like, pronouncing the letter S, but pretending to have a lisp, automatically makes it a hard "Th".
I guess all mediterranean countries feel a bit like us due to weather and food
However when I visited australia the weather and surf/beach feeling really made me feel at home
Can't wait to return to Croatia
In some ways, I felt at home
Love from Portugal
I've never been to Serbia, but when I listen to Serbian ballads I feel like I'm listening to a type of fado
Serbian ballads are definitely the most "fado" like type of music I've ever found until now
I mean: what is [this] The instrumental, the use of the voices, the way they deliver the lyrics
Or [this] I feel like Mariza could sing this
Now I just remembered that Belarus even tried to send a song about potatoes to Eurovision two years ago
Not exactly near, but I would say the "[Portas de Almourão] where the [Ocreza river] breaks an important geological fault line
You can appreciate the power water erosion there, and how the river managed to open a "door" in the mountains
Given that geologically this was a region that had gold, you can also find archeological evidence near the river of Roman and Medieval gold extraction
Most likely [this] waterfall (called [Pulo do Lobo] As a whole for the region, maybe the [cork tree forests] where the black iberian pigs roam free
I live now close to this [unice cave] Here, in the Algarve region, you can find a lot of unice landscape anomalies like:
- [Arco de Albandeira]
- [Praia da Marinha
A cliff with a unice schape]
- [Algar seco with this natural pool]
- [Praia da Falésia with this orange tone cliffs]
The pictures of the website don't do it justice, it is a very impressive landscape once you are there
Unfortunately the Portuguese craze for planting eucalyptus trees and the yearly forest fires (which are in no way related to the eucalyptus themselves that burn like napalm) have destroyed most of the natural surrounding landscape and heavily eroded the soils
The place must have been beautiful in Roman times, when it was covered in oaks
It just means they were made by italians
That is a very long discussion with political considerations, but long story short, the paper industry is very powerful in Portugal
Eucalyptus, native of Australia, adapts well to the Portuguese climate and produces a lot of wood
An eucalyptus forest gets harvested every seven years, in some cases
This generates a lot of income for land owners, the alternative for those plots of land would either in many cases, pine trees (lower productivity and also very prone to forest fires), oak trees (which take forever to grow) or traditional olive groves (not really economically viable at today's hand labor costs), so they go with the dreaded eucalyptus
Eucalyptus have a huge environmental impact, and it is only economically viable because they don't pay the real cost
They burn like napalm, like I said, but the cost of fighting forest fires gets supported by tax payers and individuals that have their property and sometimes lives lost
They destroy the soil, which takes millennia to regenerate, but that cost will be supported by future generations
I use Microsoft Teams too
I have classes from 9:00 am to 4:15 pm every weekday
Normally I have 2 lessons per day, but I can have 5 total
My school also uses Microsoft teams, although I think the app doesn't fell finished
It has a lot of flaws
At my university we're using Zoom and Google Meet for the classes (depends on the teacher)
It ranges from 4-8 hours of classes a day, plus several assignments
I can't wait for the vacations to start
Portuguese guy here, we're having online classes through Colibri Zoom
We are using Zoom for online lessons
But we’re going to school for presential classes on the subjects we are going to make exams
Ah yes, another Portuguese
Oh boy
That I know of
Venda das raparigas - girls fair
Venda da gaita - penis fair
Picha - another name for penis
Pesos - another name for testicles
Vale da rata - pussy valey
Sarilhos - troubles
Vale porco - dirty valey
Amor - love
24 de julho - 24th of July
Anais - anals
Purgatório - purgatory
Casal do grelo - pussy couple
Bexiga - bladder
Most of these are not the original meanings but nonetheless they make for funny names
Traseiros - butts
Venda das raparigas - girls for sale
Picha - pussy
There are others but I'm lazy
We have a vilage called Covide which has the same pronounciation as the Covid virus

Moimenta-Alcafache Train Crash
The official dead count was 49 but the estimates point to 150 dead
A regional train and and an international one crashed
The regional stoped every station and should have waited in Mangualde to wait the international train but continued on, estimating that the delay in the international's service would be enough for the regional to get to next station, where the crossing could be effected
The delay wasn't enough and the two trains collided
Only in Portugal people are so used to trains being late that they crash when on time
Wiki link for the interested
Normally they will ask/scream/affirm something about Cristiano Ronaldo
The exception was in Nowhere, Nevada, USA, where they asked me about drugs policy in Portugal
When I say I am Portuguese they always refer Cristiano Ronaldo, the sun and some vacations they did in Lisbon or Algarve
Some also talk about the cheap booze and food
Sounds accurate
"Cristiano Ronaldo"
Used to be that you'd get people saying something about Mourinho, but not as common nowadays
I hope it is joking or they are not Europeans
I made the effort to learn the Eastern countries
Is one of the best things about our country
Listen here you little блиять.
Happy Cake day
Just on our highest mountain (Serra da Estrela)
It hasn't snowed regularly for 20 years
No, but it never snows here in South Portugal
Maybe like twice in a century
Nope, in Portugal, there's only snow on the mountains and even that is fairly rare
The last time I saw snow in my city was 5 years ago, and I live in the north of Portugal
*laughs in Portuguese*
It's not like it never snows anywhere here (in fact, it did snow in our highest mountain the other day) but for most of the south of the country, it's a real event when it snows
Well, no, but I live in Southern Portugal: it pretty much never snows around here (one time in the last 35 years, I believe)
Probably either of the following:
[This one] depicts a British and a Portuguese soldiers from WW1 shaking hands
Brothers in arms, most literally
[This one] is a picture of our own filthy dictator, António de Oliveira Salazar
This particular one is very famous because it was mandatory to have one hung up on the wall of EACH AND EVERY CLASSROOM in the country
Finally, [this one] was one of the first pictures taken after the extinguishing of a massive fire that completely tore down the Grandella Warehouses, a very famous store in Lisbon
The fire ocurred in 1988
The best iteration of a Salazar picture is definitely [this one] May he rot
God bless the Revolution
25 de Abril sempre
He came to power before Hitler, actually
He was nominated as Finance Minister of the new military dictatorship (that was established after the coup d'etat of 1926) in 1929 and became head of government in 1932
Portugal was one of the first European countries to turn to the far-right, and one of the last to leave it
Yeah, people say he ran a democracy, which is not true
He simply had a political police around so if people said anything about the regime, they'd get tortured and/or arrested
Yeah, I think he had a portrait of him in his office
Haha, much obliged
After reading all these comments
*cries in portugal caralho*
Italian, it's so positive and even when they telling you to f*ck off it's better sounding then when I try to confess and immense amount of love to someone
I have to say German .. just makes my heart melt
Latin, but also German when it's sung like in opera idk it gives a grandiose feeling that's hard to describe idk, Italian idk know the language but I understand a good chuck and its both nostalgic and new and like the sound of it, Portuguese (totally not biased) but I like it and find it beautiful when it's spoken when it's sung in fado music its almost like hearing the soul of every Portuguese at once
These plebeians don't understand the quiet, understated beauty of a drunken Russian trying to neg a garbage bin
On behalf of Portugal, obrigado caralho
After having a bottle of bagaço, caralho
Thanks, shortbread is awesome
Not aware of other relevant rulers, but a few immediately come to mind:
* [Dom Henrique, Count of Portugal] \- not actually a King, he was a count and the father of the first king of Portugal
A noble man of the house of [Burgundy] born in Dijon but ethnically a German
He ruled over the county of Portugal, that latter under the rule of his son, would become the kingdom of Portugal
* [Felipe I] [II] and [III] \- all Spanish born, inbred Habsburg kings of Portugal during the period of the Iberian Union of crowns
The only Portuguese kings not eligible to the title "Dom" before their names
* [Dom Fernando II] \- The consort king to [Dona Maria II] was a German prince of the house [Saxe-Coburg and Gotha-Koháry] Although never officially the head of state, he has very involved in the rule of the kingdom, and during his wife's pregnancies was the *de facto* ruler
After his wife passed away the title of King passed on to his son Dom Pedro V, which was still a minor, and Dom Fernando II assumed the regency for two more years
He built one of the most beautiful monuments in Portugal, the [Palacio da Pena]
First class of the 7th or 8th grade with a new French teacher and the dude casually says that Monaco is an island
That rubbed me the wrong way because I thought it wasn't, but it was a French teacher (not just french language, actually *born-in-France* teacher, with the accent and all) saying that, so I just thought I was wrong and didn't say anything
Then, one of the smartest kids in class challenged the teacher and said that Monaco wasn't an island and then chaos ensued
They started arguing, people who thought it wasn't an island but weren't sure so they wouldn't have said anything started saying so and the teacher got PISSED
He started arguing with everyone, saying we were rude and couldn't possibly know more about Monaco than him
Long story short, it was the first and last class we had with him because he resigned after that
Apparently, he had been hired on a whim because the last French teacher had resigned due to health issues just days before the start of the school year and this guy just saw accepting the position as a "favor" he was doing to someone he knew on the school board, so when he realized we would actually be a pain in the butt he resigned
I was in 8 or 9 grade when my chemistry and physics teacher tried to teach us that if you had two equal lamps in series the first would be brighter then the second (because it would "eat up" all the electricity)
My dad is an electrical engineer, I grew up making circuits for fun and he had taught me a lot of this stuff already, so I was pretty confident that what my teacher had just said was wrong
I told her this and she got mad and after a few minutes of basically screaming at me she then wrote a note to my dad saying she was the teacher and that she was right
I showed the note to my dad and explained what happened
Easy to say that he was not happy either
He then wrote a note back explaining her how it worked and why she was wrong (almost calling her dumb)
After that she didn't like me very much and I had that teacher from 7 to 12 grade
So fun
But well, it was the same teacher that usually asked us to divide some random number by 1 in the calculator "just to make sure
She wasn't very smart, but her mother used to be a teacher at the same school (and a very influential/rich family in my city) and had very good connections so her daughter was set for life there no matter how many times the students complained
Well, my 11th grade english teacher said the n-word multiple times, so that's among the dumbest things she said
What's a grammar school
I can definitely see her point
>That the Earth was thought to be flat in the Middle Ages
Wtf
The teacher is refering to a bridge, literally
So yeah he's wrong
Everyone knows since the Greek that earth is round, the Portuguese knew it, the Spanish knew it
Without that knowledge a sea voyage would be impossible to calculate and know where you are
don't know how that misconceptions even gain popularity
Portugal here (sup neighbor) it's a small thing usually here, we have children going around and singing and people give a bit of money
They'll wear paper crowns and whatnot
Not this year obviously
And you have dinner with family on the day aswell
Usually the portuguese signature dish
codfish
In my family we usually have dinner together and eat bolo rei (king cake), but I don't know about other families
Some people sing door-by-door and the owners of said houses give them some money, at least where I live
No true at all, loads of towns have holiday events and, specially small towns, people sing door to door, kinda like Halloween but you eat cake (bolo rei) and wine
[Boas Festas Boas Feeestas
“Attention, it’s cold outside !” Shows every city in the country being cold, asks people if they think it’s very cold or just regular cold
Over and over again
I liked the version they started during the Weekend lockdowns
"So, Mr
Reporter, how many people are in the main square of -Smallportuguesetown-?"
"None, Mr
Anchor"
And then keep doing that for several places during 20 minutes
Yup, also happened during New Years Eve
“Let’s go to Évora, how many people in Évora
Just police
Let’s go to Aveiro, how many people in Aveiro
None
Let’s go to Porto, one car is coming down Aliados Avenue, big news
Let’s now see how cold it is in Guarda”
Like max of 12 celsius
Like 10°C
So true, I felt bad for all the reporters who are most likely to be interns or in entry levels to be there doing ... nothing
They even sent one to a hospital that had no commotion
30 is average, 35 might get a warning just because of wildfires not for the heat itself
+40 will get a warning probably but it's not uncommon
We need winter warnings bellow 10ºC because our construction is shit so people will try to heat their houses with the most shitty heaters so along with the cold warnings we get warnings regarding possible fatal gases from these heaters, specially for older people
How's that easy, they are basically using their inexperience at the company to "pressure" them to take those slots that nobody wants
They probably even say it's an opportunity for them to show their talent
In Portugal I have to say it's the famous line of Fernando pessoa, a fucking genius of literature and poetry:
"Oh mar salgado, quanto do teu sal são lágrimas de Portugal"
"Oh salty sea, how much of your salt are tears of Portugal"
It rhymes in Portuguese and it's about the family members lost and overall sorrow and loss of sailors in the age of discoveries
I personally think Fernando Pessoa has better, deeply philosophical and absolutely incredible lines but you can't translate poetry, I tried in this comment but it fails to capture the geniality and essence of what it conveys in English
But definitely check out this alcoholic opium smoking genius with multiple personas (each with their own history, philosophical and even handwriting differences) if you speak Portuguese, it's truly mind-blowing once you get into it
Uff, that's a tough one
Portuguese people (and Brazilians too, I think) like to speak in proverbs, and metaphors and rimes
Many of these come from poems
So it's hard to say which is most popular
Many are
So a common one would be Fernando Pessoa's "Valeu a pena
Tudo vale a pena, quando a alma não é pequena
" (Was it worth it
Everything's worth it when the soul is not tiny)
I'll let others comment other examples
I think in Portugal that would be "Amor é fogo que arde sem se ver" by Camões which translates into "Love is fire that Burns without being seen", literally everyone knows it
Uff, that's a tough one

"Amor é fogo que arde sem se ver" (Love is fire that is not seen) by Camões is also very famous
Fernando Pessoa makes me proud to be Portuguese
Fernando Pessoa (still
) is a genius
He also wrote some poems in english since he lived in south africa
But i ve never read any of is english works
There's also the slogan he wrote for Coca-Cola, when he worked on an advertisement company: "Primeiro estranha-se, depois entrenha-se" (First you find it odd, then you enjoy it)
This is now a popular proverb and many people use it without realising it comes from Fernando Pessoa and what he was referring too
Pessoa is definitely the most famous poet alongside Camões, but I'd say that the most known poem is "Balada da Neve" by Augusto Gil
At least the first stanza:
Batem leve, levemente,
como quem chama por mim
Será chuva
Será gente
Gente não é, certamente
e a chuva não bate assim
Since you're Irish I have to reply a really beautiful poem also by William Butler Yeats about an Irish fighter pilot in ww1 (I think) :
An Irish airman foresees his death:
I know that I shall meet my fate
Somewhere among the clouds above;
Those that I fight I do not hate,
Those that I guard I do not love;
My country is Kiltartan Cross,
My countrymen Kiltartan’s poor,
No likely end could bring them loss
Or leave them happier than before
Nor law, nor duty bade me fight,
Nor public men, nor cheering crowds,
A lonely impulse of delight
Drove to this tumult in the clouds;
I balanced all, brought all to mind,
The years to come seemed waste of breath,
A waste of breath the years behind
In balance with this life, this death
Dante is incredible
I want to know Italian just to read Dante to be honest, my dad used to read it to me when I was younger, it's so geniously beautiful
Never read it myself, but "O Livro do Desassossego" is pretty famous abroad as well
The thing with Pessoa is that he wrote under many names and personas (which is funny given his last name), and you likely have to look for Bernardo Soares for that one
I'm sure there's more, but most of his work is poetry
Read the Book of Disquiet
It's also fairly good in English actually (Penguin Edition)
He also has some stuff originally written in English and German, I think
He was fluent in many languages
But these are not has famous or brilliant, I think
He was an anglophone, he got a British education whilst living in South Africa
There's plenty of original texts
Most poetry is in portuguese but in the last decades there has been an upswing about him outside of Portugal, you definitely will find works in German
Well, we don't appear in movies a lot
But I think the French movie [The Golden Cage] does a good job
It's a comedy about Portuguese emigrants in France who then move back to Portugal
There's also the movie [Silence] by Martin Scorsese which is about an adventure of Portuguese priests in Japan
It features some Hollywood famous people
EDIT: I've never seen Silence, but by the trailer, I think it's kind of silly the way they pronounce Portuguese names
I wonder what people from Kazakhstan think of the new Borat movie
You can hardly call The Golden Cage French
The director, which was the one that came up with the idea, is Portuguese and the majority of the actors are Portuguese
I also wouldn't say it portrays our country well at all
It is basically a cliched comedy that uses a bunch of stereotypes to make fun of the Portuguese immigrants in France that came from a poor background
I'm glad they didn't change the setting
The fact that it was still set in Sweden made it more interesting to me, because it's not something I see much of in most of the movies I watch
Not a movie, but there's a Japanese manga/anime called Shoukoku no Altair (Altair: A Record of Battles) that's very much based on the Ottoman Empire
The story takes place in a fictional world, but it has a very Turkish flavour
Of course it also looks super anime with regards to the character designs, but it's interesting nonetheless
I'd recommend the manga over the anime though
Well, it's a comedy
What are comedies without stereotypes
I don't love it, but I think it's kinda funny
Many people started suggesting this to me
I certainly will
I haven't seen it
I just knew about it and that people tough it was cool
A curious remark though: for a lot of people in the world (outside Europe), being a catholic was synonym  with being Portuguese
Even in the 20th century, you could find people in India who described themselves as "Portuguese". In fact, the catholic faith is entrenched very deep in our culture that is not merely a matter of belief and faith, but of identity
This is because Portuguese colonialism model gave much importance to conversion
In the times of the empire, there was a big debate about the rights of native people and the most important duty of teaching them about Catholicism
Well it's at least more believable than casting Brits as ancient Romans and Greeks
Also Stellan Skarsgard was in it, so that's at least one Swede
Unless they're a native speaker, don't speak Spanish
Everyone under 40 is relatively fluent in English
Don't disrespect the historical monuments
Be polite, always say "excuse me", "please", "sir/madam/miss", "good morning", "good day", "good afternoon" and "good night". We'll be deeply moved by an "Obrigado".
Don't call a POC "preto", it's considered more offensive than the N-word
Please, please, *please* don't steal the Azulejo tiles from the monuments
Many of them are hundreds of years old and irreplaceable
If you want one, please buy them from gift shops
Decriminalization =/= legalise
If You are caught smoking weed you will not be be arrested however if you posses more than the legal quantity for self use you will be arrested, you cannot sell it because the Decriminalization only protects the user and not the drug seller
And ignore the guy at terreiro do passo screaming "Axies" "cocaine", they are scammers trying to sell spices by saying that they are drugs
They are annoying to everyone not just tourists
Or toast with "This one is for the cause
I'm guessing you guys wouldn't like us Southerners very much
Whats the problem with black, grey and blue
The French disliked that
we always call it "Holanda" in Portugal, even text books use it
No one calls it "Países Baixos", or very rarely
Sorry
You should add drinking outside, I've gotten in trouble with the police for that once
Idk about england but Macron there is geting some unhappy responses
Oh no
Brazilian Portuguese is very well known here since we're so exposed to their telenovelas and songs
Hurts our pride a little bit though
Probably because both Spain and Portugal call it Holanda too
We call a Dutch person Holandês or Holandesa
It's similar to what we do with the Forcados, the objective is to tire to bull into submission and grab them by the horns
Once the bull submits, they let him go
There's no need to hurt him
Can confirm

A ida da família real para o Brasil é controversa
Uns consideram que foi uma manobra brilhante do rei João  VI para escapar ao Napoleão, outros que ele não passou de cobarde e de um traidor que fugiu dos Franceses e ficou na boa vida enquanto o povo dele era invadido por estrangeiros e morto, sendo necessária chantagem para o fazer regressar
A reliable place to buy affordable furniture
The cantine's not bad at all
The Swedish supermarket in it is a great place to by mulled wine and Daim chocolate
And the Ikea closest to me also attracts a lot of Spanish people (at least I'm assuming that's why so many go to the mall adjoining it)
In my opinion, IKEA is affordable and has good overall quality
Not a luxury brand at all but I live in Northern Portugal and very close to Porto we have a region where some of the best furniture in the world is built so we can , as I did, order some custom built furniture for a price that can almost compete with Ikea, but with a lot more quality and better materials
P.S. - I own some Ikea furniture and house wears and am happy with it
Nice place to go shopping for forniture, basically everyone goes there, also it has good food
And its a hella of a maze
Well, at least for me, it's not a place to by furniture, it's _the_ place to by furniture
We had a brand called _Moviflor_ but it went bankrupt, so, now, IKEA is the place
Let me guess, Algarve
There was also Conforama, but I have no idea whether that exists anymore
Moviflor still exists, but the quality is way worse than it used to be
Yup
There's always Spaniards there haha
Still exists
Sells crappy furniture more expensive than IKEA
Maybe because the IKEA in Portugal sells coffee with pastel de nata that cost 50 cents
I've wondered about that, because in the past that's where we used to go
Maybe it's closer for the people near the border, or maybe it is indeed cheaper
Disliking or expressing any negative comment regarding certain books, movies or characters
For some people, that immediately turns you into every -ist in the book
Captain Marvel is one of the most boring movies in the MCU, and Brie Larson's acting was wooden
In what parts did you feel that
Oh my, thank you
I feel so brave
I also found that Ghostbusters 2016 wasn't funny
Shhh
Don't tell Twitter or Tumblr, they'll say I betrayed my fellow women
Actually yeah, I thought it was fine
Thank you for putting me in my place, virtuous knight in shining armor
Thank you :)
Idk ask the Portuguese people in azores, they are irradiated from the American support
The base had radioactive stuff secretly there and illegal (has far has i know), and several cases of cancer are associated to that
Well in Portugal they used to use Lajes' Air Base ever since 1942 during WW2, when we leased it
In 2018 they withdrew major operations from it and I'm glad for it
The joint UK-US lease during WW2 might have been needed to allow for efficient war against the Axis (the Azores are undoubtedly the best air base in the Atlantic due to how easy it makes traversing it, allowing for simpler movements when talking about Europe-America logistics) but I'm glad they packed up and left
Like someone pointed out below, the USSR withdrew their forces after the end of the Cold War
America kept it and even tried to expand it
The ssoner they pack up and leave, the happier I get
Lots
I can only remember Poland, Romania and Bulgaria
Ukraine will never field American troops as their presence against the Russians might trigger WW3 and fortunately, the U.S.A aren't really that fond of it yet and refuse to take part (proxy wars are still they way to go in their foreign policy ahah)
Unless you consider the Balkans or even Turkey, Eastern Europe
Then it's a completely different can of worms as there are actually some bases
The Warsaw Pact had already fallen by the time they collapsed
Even more, the U.S should have withdrawn as well as their primary target didn't exist anymore, yet their presence continued after
Russian forces are still present in some territories but nowhere near as many as the U.S and it doesn't have to do with the collapse of the USSR as much as the fact they wanted to maintain their grip
Otherwise they would have left when their enemy had fallen
I didn't say they didn't exist, just that I didn't see them as countries that "consider an American military presence to be a guarantee of safety from a Russian invasion
Well I didn't know, otherwise I wouldn't have said so
Besides, I consider all of the above more Baltic than Eastern, which doesn't mean you aren't right but more that I wasn't thinking about them and did not know enough about their situation regarding U.S military presence
I thought nowadays they relied more on themselves and their neighbours, like Poland, Sweden, etc
I lived in Scotland for a year and I don't think I ever bought a bottle of water there
The tap water memes are real
Unfortunately it's very hit or miss in Portugal
Where I live you certainly can't drink it
But I do prefer our bottled water over that of other countries
We got some pretty good cheese too
Definitely can't compete with the top dogs in Europe, but I'd say we're a solid second tier
Hold up
What
Maybe you are thinking about ultra pure water
Supposedly you can't drink that water since its so pure it will strip the nutrients off you
Not really
But in my town, there is an ice cream shop owned by a polish family that does also pierogies
None that I know of
We have plenty of ukrainian/russian (or bielorussian) grocery stores, a few romanian or moldavian as well but polish or polish immigrants I never met
We had a big influx of immigration from Ukraine/Moldavia and other former soviet republics in the early 2000s, many stayed and integrated but there is still plenty of grocery shops and some immigrant cafés and masses and things like that
Can it be specific time periods
If so i like a lot Ancient Greek history, mostly because of philosophy
France during the French revolution the development of such an event still amazes me, and the echos that still are present today of things and ideas born from it are amazing
American history during the civil rights era and during the civil war
There are many more but it would be a huge list xP
I love ancient history, particularly that concerning Mesopotamia
I always felt frustrated that my world history classes didn't go into more detail concerning that region and time period
I also find the history of Italy to be incredibly interesting, from the Roman Empire to things like the Papal States, the Lombard League and the unification of the country and rise of Fascism
1577
Maybe beat some sense into a certain somebody before returning home
I'm scared a week would be enough time for me to die, but I'd be very interested in seeing Lisbon, as well as other parts of the country affected by the 1755 earthquake/tsunami before the latter happened
Also would be cool to see the country during the Roman and Moorish eras
The week before the earthquake of 1755, Lisbon was at its peak because of the golden era of the discoveries and I always wanted to have a view of the opera that was just built when the earthquake happened
Hmm
This is a tricky question due to the vast history in here and there's many situations in history I would love to see with my eyes, so will give you 3
Battle of São Mamede, where our first king revolted against his mother creating the first kingdom of Portugal and gaining independence from Castille
Battle of Aljubarrota, one of the Spanish (Castille) invasions where we defeated them (6,6k Portuguese vs 31k Castilleans)
Or the first time we arrived in Brasil would love to see what was the reaction of the first tribes to cross paths with the Portuguese and the reaction of the Portuguese, how they lived and how was their day to day life
The only right answer
Omg same like I’d probably die but I just want to SEE IT
If you were allowed to change history and go back to try and get people to vote to stay in what would you do
Next year king Sebastião went on a crusade in Morocco without a heir, leading in a decise defeat and the death of much of the Portuguese elite
Good option
Or marry someone
Moreover, he went to fight inland and lost to attrition, essentiallly, when the whole reason Portugal had been dominating warfare against our enemies at the time through naval force and attrition
I can sing the French and German anthem
I also can humming Spanish (because they don't have official lyrics) and Russian anthem
Interestingly, I don't know anything about the UK anthem
That's all rich ppl do in soap operas but I've meet a few ppl that could've be considered wealthy or better off but I only new this cuz my friends would tell they were loaded, otherwise mb if you check the clothes or smth to know how much paper they carrying
The show with more episodes is the Portuguese version of the "[Price is right] which has been running continuously, every day, since the 11th of February 2002
Over 3600 episodes, and counting
It started as a way to help people get used to the prices of things in euros
Azores accent - Portuguese island
On the news they get subtitles
Specifically the accent from the island of São Miguel
The Açores consist of nine islands, and their accent is by far the worst
I disagree
Some areas of Andalucia have the strangest accents where they eat half their words and speak super quick
Spanish from the Canary Islands is also quite challenging
You guys can even understand Portuñol
Truly impressing on your part
More precisely in Rabo de Peixe, it's the most hardcore accent
Can confirm this
In college I had classes with a girl with some accent (I couldn't pinpoint where from) but I perfectly understood what she said
When she mentioned she was Azorean I was really surprised
I don't recall what her island was (I don't think she ever told me lol), but I'm sure it wasn't São Miguel
I'm a native portuguese and I can barely understand a word of what they say
We need to put subtitles to understand [this]
Every winter in the highlands of Beira Interior as well as several places in the  Northeast regions
Last winter it covered several districts [Viseu, Guarda, Castelo Branco, Bragança and Vila Real]
I hear it snows in the far north and the Serra da Estrela(Mountain chain) and in 2004 it snowed in Lisbon
unfortunately I didn't experience it
In my city, NEVER
In some parts of the country it snows every winter
It snows in the winter in some parts of the east and northeast but never in my region (Porto) unfortunately
Haven’t seen snow in Lisbon since 2004, and it went away just like that
Not exactly sure, but in my 18 years of existence it snowed 1 time on the 6th of January of 2009
At least where i live it was 1 time
Exactly the same in Portugal
Iberian Brothers at it again
In portugal too
Same in Portugal
>Also, let's talk about where to put the currency mark
Do you put it before (€500) or after (500€) the amount
Usually "500€", because we say "500 euros", not "euros 500".
Not quite
We use the intervals for the thousands separation, and dots are also acceptable
For decimals, **only commas** are acceptable
10 000 000,00
000
000,00
Are both correct forms
And Brazil, which annoys us, Portuguese, to no end
Did not know about that hahahaha exactly
With the billions and "thousand millions" too
Se estiveres no telemóvel/tablet tens que dar dois enters para dar parágrafo
Fair enough, I guess I meant it as Portuguese being more intuitive in that regard and applying "the way we speak" to "the way we write".
If think in some official documents like bank reports and the like, the symbol might also appear before (i.e, € 500 or even EUR 500), but granted those sort of documents usually have an international audience or have to comply with international norms, hence that usage
In regular Portuguese writing, the currency symbol always comes after the number
You mean, dots for decimals
I get people writing them informally/casually and I also accept the programming context, but in accounting, in official documents
I really doubt it and if it does happen, they're most definitely doing it wrong
I really don't see anyone doing it officially, just because of the sheer confusion it would generate among other colleagues and in that business area alone
Religion is usually seen as a private affair and most people don't mention what's their stance about religion unpromptedly
However, if the question arises and someone says they're an atheist no one would bat an eye
It's not unusual or stigmatised to be an atheist, here
I'm an Atheist and don't have any complaints
Sure, some of the more religious older people will probably think it's strange but who cares
Depends on who's viewing I guess
Older people (WW2 kids to about 80s kids) are very religious so they'd probably complain or make the usual kind of innocent remark "But you'll go to hell" or something along those lines
Our country's history is very aligned with Christianity so it's normal
Younger people honestly don't care and have a much higher percentage of atheism than older people
i guess most of the people are very neutral but a lot of us celebrate christmas
I don't think one thing percludes the other in Portugal
It's perfectly feasible (and common) for an atheist (provided they're not the fundamentalist type) to celebrate Christmas, here
There's enough secular aspects to it, that you can celebrate it without any issue
I'm an atheist and I love Christmas
yeah, youve got a point
yea but the point is, Christmas is technically a religious celebration
Selfie man
Selfies and more selfies
Also, he is always talking to people and going to like town fairs and stuff
Overall awesome
If you haven't took a selfie with him yet, you're in the minority
Don't forget how he pushed Trump's arm
Don't mess with the Professor
I once met Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa in a restaurant, when they accidentally sat us at his usual table
Apparently he really likes that restaurant, even having a favourite place, and the bosses made mistakes and confused the days (it was Wednesday and they thought he only came on Thursday, something like that)
Then, the boss, completely ashamed, comes to me and apologizes, asking if we could sit at another table and that he himself would offer us the meal as compensation
My sister and my cousin were happy with the deal, but I decided to be a prick, pretending to not understand what was going on to see if they offered us anything else
Hearing this, Marcelo appears from out of nowhere saying that there was no problem and that we could finish our meal in peace, that he would wait at the bar
As a fan of Marcelo, I immediately changed my tone and offered him the seat
He was very grateful, shook my hand and gave me his personal card, asking me to call him later
That night I called him and, to be brief, we had a torrid passion for 11 months, man to man, that I will never forget
Our bodies intertwined in one, and from Morocco to the French Riviera, at the bottom of the sea of ​​the Galápagos Islands and in the frozen section of the Jumbo, next to the fish sticks, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa and I gloriously fucked in six of the seven continents
Nah, I'm good (Inb4 drool)
I tried taking one when he went to the Congresso Nacional de Medicina Geral e Familiar in 2017, but there were way too many people trying to take pictures with him so I gave up
She's literally a predator
I'm willing to bet that if it was a 39 year old man and a 15 year old girl you wouldn't be saying "let them be" and "who cares"
I think people are missing the point
It's not that she was older than him it's that she was 40 and HE WAS FUCKING 15
There's a big difference between an adult/adult relatuonship and an adult/underage  boy relationship Jesus fucking Christ I'll say it again if it was man going after an underage girl he'dve been dead the minute he laid eyes on her
I'm not criticising Macron I'm criticising his predator of a wife
With a sh sound
Although our phonetics tend to pronounce the letter "s" as a "sh" in numerous situations as it is
In Portuguese it's written "Budapeste", which is pronounced exactly like *Budapesht*, so pronouncing it the same way in English doesn't bother me
In Portuguese we say budape-shte
We love our sh’s
With a "sh" sound but that's not because of the Hungarian pronunciation
It's just that "st" is pronounced "sht" in Portuguese
We only pronounce that sequence with an s sound in foreign words
In portuguese we pronounce some S letters with a G/J sound so, considering Budapest in portuguese is Budapeste, it would be something like "Boo Dah Pehj Te" (hard to explain but oh well I tried)
So it's kinda a Sh sound
With an S sound
However, S sounds in some accents of Portuguese tend to drift naturally into Sh sounds, specially at the end of syllables
Yes, in Portuguese when a "s" comes before a consonant it always makes a "sh" sound
Nah, it's almost always a Sh sound if it's before consonants in Portugal
Brazilians might say "Budapesstxi" in some reasons, though
Depends on the accent
Some beira interior accents, like for instance from the Guarda region, occasionally pronounce it like an s, even if there's a consonant afterwards
Like in the words: "descer; nascer; piscina".
depends on the accent
some people from Center/North Portugal would tend for a more ssss sound
But those are exceptions
They still use the "sh" before consonants except the C.
In fact, most of the country just says "desher" "nasher" and "pshina", so the sc is a special case in most parts of the country anyway
Add it to the big board of Portuguese pronunciation rules :D
That's totally true, of course, but for the most part that's in this way
No we don't. It's always a sh sound
Budapeste
it's not
there are accents where the S sound doesn't turn to Sh, believe it or not
In Portugal
No there aren't. The only exception is how high beirão people say "sc" and say "nacer". But everyone says a sh before a t.
I was born and raised in the Azores, granted it's not half way around the world but it's off continental Europe, and I feel perfectly European
We might be more up to date with mainland stuff through TV stuff than previous generations but there's still plenty to be aware of on a daily around here
When it comes to representation and knowledge of us on the mainland it's absolute crap still
Which island, if you don’t mind me asking
It’s just funny, I’m half portuguese half American with an Azorean mother (you can guess from which island) and in the US most of the people I meet with a connection to Portugal are of Azorean descent, and the islands seem to me to almost unilaterally represent the perception of Portugal there, but now that I live in mainland Portugal, I’m surprised by how separate the islands feel from the rest of Portugal
Everyone knows by now that Portugal == Lisbon
The rest is scenary
Gotta get those Websummits going and those hostels popping and those rents skyrocketing
I think I would  like to live there
I'm planning on visiting in September
Tired of Lisbon, tired
We maybe need another earthquake (but without deaths)
A quick search on the internet and I found out that roughly half of the population of the island is Portuguese or Portuguese-descendent, we are everywhere
Terceira
I'm guessing your dad was or is in the air force
There's a US/PT/NATO military base
I grew up on that base for the early part of my life
It wasn't nothing, there were so many people from the US and it was awesome
Quite a bit of cultural and linguistic stuff that the islanders who grew up in or around the base got, such as the word for mop, sounds a bit like map in English and Portuguese, so we started calling the mop map in Portuguese, that's one thing that gives us the look from other islands and mainland
Loads of fun
Well, used to be
When Benfica faced PSG that one time in 2007, half or so of Parc des Princes was full of Benfica fans
It felt like Benfica was playing at home
Lol I always mess up the name of that city
- Japanese, because I'm into a lot of stuff made in Japan (I swear I'm not that much a weeb
- Italian, because I like the sound of it and because I want to explore the country without there being a language barrier
- Arabic, Egyptian to be precise
A lot of countries speak have Arabic as their official language, plus I think it sounds cool
Japanese, Chinese and French
I am already learning French
I could speak better when I was younger but I still need a lot of training
* Russian, so I could read my favourite books in their original language
* German and French, so I could speak to the largest number of fellow Europeans in their native tongue
I like learning languages so even though the languages on my "to learn" list are french, german and italian, I'd probably choose some harder ones like mandarin, japanese or some form of arabic
The other ones I can learn on my own
Wait, there's an Iberian language
Oh I'm a recovering weeb
There's still a lot I like about the country, but I'm no longer a "Japan ichiban
" type guy
If I could pick one more language it would probably be German
I did actually start learning it, but my studies are currently on hold
I should get back to it
You may know that Portugal and the Portuguese are also called Lusitania and Lusitanians
We strongly identify with the Lusitanians
Even Brazil was first called "New Lusitania". That said, it would be very interesting to know how the original Lusitanian language sounded like
Likely drastically different from Galician-Portuguese
we don’t have monuments from USSR but we do have monuments from the Portuguese communist party to the communists that died fighting for freedom when we were run by fascist dictator Salazar
Here in Cologne (Germany) your empty beer glass will often be replaced with a full one automatically by the staff
If you are done drinking, you should cover the beer glass with your coaster
At least beer in Germany is affordable
In Portugal I've never seen a police officer without a holster and a handgun
In Portugal most of them are armed with unloaded glocks :'')
France is a place with some agitation, police with guns is understandable
Portugal is a very peaceful place, even our protests are very orderly
I don't think guns are necessary but the police has them, small ones at their waist
In Portugal police has guns too
They have small guns at their waist
They almost never use them
I was taught that America is a continent with subcontinents in it (América do Norte, América Central and América do Sul)
We are also taught about Oceania, Australia is just a country for us
I've always heard the world consists of 6 continents and 5 oceans
That's it for us too
Really
I was taught there were 2 continents in America
Europe, Africa, and Asia are one contiguous land mass
Whether they are considered a continent technically or not I’m not sure
I’m not sure rivers and canals count, otherwise the Panama Canal would split North America
A joke
Cycling in Portugal is a sport, not a way of getting around
I am aware of some local exceptions but even those pale in comparison to what you see in central Europe
Doesn't help that we have rather hilly cities and that most places close enough to bike to work would be prohibitively expensive for most people
Unless we had dedicated train/metro carts for helping this out, I don't see it ever becoming a thing in Lisbon/Porto, and other cities don't even have that (although biking distances in other cities are more feasible, terrain aside)
We still could do a lot better than what we do
Our cities are also much hillier than those in central Europe, perhaps that's why it's not as popular as other countries as a way of commuting
I mean, i spent about 4 years of my life going to school by bike, and honestly it worked perfectly fine, better than car imo
I don't think the existence or non existence of a specific bike only line matters at all, but then again i'm young and fit so i guess dedicated bike roads would matter to others
I started cycling around Lisbon a few months ago and I must tell you it's not that bad
Before I thought I'd need an olympic preparation to commute but it's been alright
How far away was your school
I'm sure it's perfectly doable, it's just that a psychological barrier is still a barrier
It's not like being in good physical shape should be something to avoid anyway
I think the biggest issue might be the lack of office showers in most places
In that case i suggest you to climb a hill in Lisbon with just gears
If you don't know what we are talking about i suggest you to see some video of the downhill race that Redbull organize some years ago
Anyway Lisbon could be a cycle city if you consider to maintain on the same level (across the river for example) and we are at the age of electrical bikes that could help with some of the climbing (not all)
Here you go, it took less than 5min searching, one at 179euros

There are likely more, but I'm trying a low ball estimate, here
E*: I never know for sure if my expectations of "what everybody knows" align with my fellow countrymen's expectations
Would João Gonçalves Zarco, the first portuguese settler capitain of Madeira count
Maybe not for everyone
There are many but probably the main would be:
D. Afonso Henriques - first king of Portugal
Aljubarrota Baker- a lady that after a battle near the Spanish border rounded up and killed a high number of spanish soldiers
Camões - the most important historical portuguese writer, the language is often called "língua de Camões".
Vasco da Gama that discovered the maritime path to India
In more recent history probably
Aristides Sousa Mendes
During WW2 he was an ambassador at France and against orders gave visas to at least 10
000 Jews and up to 30
000 saving them from the Holocaust
I would also put D. Sebastião, everyone knows his legend
>Would João Gonçalves Zarco, the first portuguese settler capitain of Madeira count
Definitely not
Not that well known outside Madeira
I would add to the list:
Infante Dom Henrique
Dom João I
Dom João II
Dom Manuel
Nuno Alvares Pereira
E o Fernão de Magalhães,  antes que os espanhóis o tentem roubar
> Marie Curie
Oh boy
Don't forget Chopin
>is it known Colombus to be italian
There is a local theory, here in Portugal, (not taken seriously by almost anyone) that he is actually from [Cuba] (a small town in the south of Portugal), and that that is the reason why he named the island with the same name
Não é que discorde contigo, mas a história do Fernão Magalhães ser a primeira pessoa a circumnavegar a Terra é mesmo muito puxada
He will save us from Sócrates
A história é realmente puxada, até porque o homem morreu a meio do caminho mas isso não impediu a América e a Colombia de receberem o nome de gajos que nunca lá puseram os pés
I mean if you include Marie Curie, who had no ties to France until adulthood, Chopin has a bigger connection with France having French ancestry and move to France at around the same age as Marie Curie
No, our tourists were also prone to do balconing in your country a few years ago (mostly in Lloret del mar) and a few died
I don't remember hearing it happening often here, though we also have balconies galore
Regarding Brits as tourists, most are well behaved, except for football holigans who don't  know how to act as civilized human beings and the occasional drunk Brit
In the UK they're used to drink huge pints so they come here and think our small Superbock beer is the same, but it has higher ammounts of alchool, causing them to get drunk very fast
Then there was what happened with Maddie McCann
There was a journalist who encouraged the British to boycott Portugal, comparing us to a 3rd world country, insulting the police, the population, calling us sardine breath, among several xenophobic insults
British turism in Portugal increased in the following year regardless of his article
We had them drop off NEMO in Amsterdam and eating their own dogs high on shrooms and stuff, which led to them getting regulated
I think those are Germans though, Brits are mainly known for traveling to Amsterdam with either a group of 20 guys or 20 girls
Girls get into all the clubs, guys are stuck drunkenly roaming around and only get accepted into the shittiest places
Normally in year 12 (senior year in high school) students organise trips (without any kind of adults present) to places like Lloret de Mar, Ibiza, Pas de la casa etc where the sole purpose is to get away from the parents and get drunk
I don’t think our tourists go there for stags and I don’t think rugby attracts that many people from here (despite being a sport that has a few followers)
Mainly they’re just drunk kids on balconies
I don't know why I said German, it was a French tourist and it happened years ago :P
Here's an article:
You’re right I’ve always said Lloret del mar for some reason, kind of a habit I guess
Corrected, thanks
That might be it, I’m almost sure I’ve heard Lloret del mar in the news, at least now I know how to spell it
I like it, compared to portuguese I would say it's better for song writing
I pretty much read and speak at a native level so if I´m reading a book that was originally written in English I will just read that instead of dealing with the portuguese translation that I have found to be imprecise at times
As comparison I also had French classes in school and that one never 'clicked' for me and I could never speak it at a passable level, but that probably is due to all the English language media we're exposed to, makes learning it easier
> I don't know how it works in other Romance, Germanic or Slavic languages, but I feel similarly about this when writing multiple-clause sentences in English, since in Portuguese it's usually okay to string multiple thoughts into one sentence, so long as it's linked with linking words and expressions, whereas in English you're more expected to instead keep short sentences and this usually ends up in repeating subjects and verbs many many times in a paragraph, which is a nightmare because you can't imply or infer them due to lack of verb conjugations
That's a (hyperbolicly) Portuguese style sentence
Here's how it should be:
> I don't know how it works in other  Romance, Germanic or Slavic languages
I do feel similarly about this when writing multiple-clause sentences in English
In Portuguese it's usually okay to string multiple thoughts into one sentence
To do so, you must link the sentences with words or expressions
Conversely, in English you're more expected to instead keep short sentences
This usually ends up in repeating subjects and verbs many many times in a paragraph
This is a nightmare because you can't use implied subjects to infer them, since verbs aren't conjugated
The simple grammar allows us to build sentences more clearly without requiring super-specific terms, which is foreigner-friendly
Portuguese has more specific words (and so does English via French), but those require a more advanced level, particularly in using verbs to track the time where something occurred: "Will have been done" is a lot simpler to get than "Estará feito", even though it's less elegant
It's like vanilla ice cream
I like it, but it's slightly bland, specially when compared with Portuguese
It's a lot more straightfoward, however it is less
expressive
The grammar is way easier than Portuguese though, specially the noun genders and verbs
I also think it may sound better in singing since it's more "round", but Portuguese sounds better in rap because the syllables are better defined and the language has more sounds (ã, hard r as in Ronaldo, ç, etc)
I also very much prefer British English over American English, the pronounciation sounds so classy and I try to speak with that accent
Oh, and the pronounciations in English are absolutely awful, my number one enemy
Just look at "coronel/kernel" or "pique/queue". In Portuguese you just read the word as it is written
Lastly, it is very interesting that sometimes I want to say something in Portuguese but I can't find a way to do it as nicely as in English or the other way around - things like "saudade", for example
Yeah, I actually meant to write "colonel" but wrote it as it is in Portuguese -_-
Para bom entendedor
Meia palavra
It means "half a word". "As minhas palavras" would mean "[The] My words".
/u/BernardoCamPt is completing a popular saying I started above:
"Para bom entendedor, meia palavra basta", meaning "For a good *understander*, half a word is enough". Which is the sort of thing you'd say to someone who hasn't understood you because you didn't explain something properly, but you have the feeling that you said it well enough for the rest to be implied
Portugal, Castelo Branco: i quite feel safe cuz the vírus on Portugal is more concentrated in Lisbon, the problem is, since we have less public transportation, my bus has a bigger route now, which is almost 70km, so Im gonna be very tired, and since Im going to 12th (last year of school) i only have classrooms at the morning, and i only have One bus at the morning and One at the afternoon, if Im lucky ill have my motocycle license by then

Unfortunately, not in a positive way, due to Romanians – Romani, most of them – begging and selling crap in the streets
So, for most of us, Romania and Romanian are perceived like that
Since I have visited your country many times, when I am speaking with someone about it, I try to explain that it isn’t exactly like that
We don't really talk about Romania here, but I'd say Dracula/Vampires and Gypsies would be the two first things people think about, sad to say
Gypsis
Wanna bet
Fellow speakers of a Romance Language, do you feel there are more similarities between us than just the language
I'm Azorean Portuguese, I don't know exactly what I feel closest to but I know for sure there's a big gap between I and people of these islands to the mainland and Mediterranean oriented areas of Europe, Italy and much of coastal Spain
I don't consider Portugal a Mediterranean country for the most part, southern Portugal seems to be the exception
If anything, I could probably say my life is a bit closer to northern Portugal and Spain or even parts of France because of the climate and even then it's a stretch, we have hundreds of years of culture and tradition making us that much more unique
This question was made towards romance language speakers, not just Europeans, so feel free to speak your mind
How do the Spanish speaking countries feel about Brazil
I would probably disagree
We have the Christian and Enlightenment background in common with the Nordics - that makes a huge difference in our cultures
Yeah, even though Portugal's southern half is drier and more Mediterranean-looking, people (and tourists that visit only the south) tend to forget that 90% of people live in the top coastal half of the country, so the median Portuguese is used to large quantities of rain and a green-ish/blue landscape except in the peak of summer
I back up this
The Portuguese feel very close to Galicians in my opinion, probably since we're both Atlantic
The rest of Spain is similar, but also different
Keep in mind that through history our link with the rest of Europe were the English, even our guitar came from them, while the Spanish Kingdoms were closer to France, and paid them a lot more attention than their little neighbor in the west, while they also had sovereignty over South Italy for a long time
Also disagree
We have loads in common with Spain, Italy and Southern France
Naturally northern Portugal has more in common with Galicia and southern Portugal has more in common with Andalucia
We are far closer to our the Latin Southern Europeans than any other people
Lots of habits and general outlook on life are essentially the same
The language definitely helps too, I feel more in common with Sicilians than Greeks or Croats for example, but I don’t think we have much in common with Romanians because they’re so different to the rest of us
Wow, I'm an Algarvian, and as such, I know very well Western Andalusia (unfortunately, I never really travelled farther than Cádiz, only in the few times I went to Gibraltar)
I'm wondering: do you fellow Andalusians feel more connected to us Algarvians/people from Alentejo (Alentejians, I guess) than people in the northern Spanish provinces
Personally, I do
I think that's because we had a lot more exposure to Arabs, so southern Iberians are very different to the northern
Italy feels like home to me
The way people sit down to enjoy a nice meal, with some nice company, a beautiful scenery and the general attitude towards life is very similar
(I was in Tuscany and Umbria)
I never met any Canarian and I don't know much about the archipelago so I can't say
Probably Canarians have much more in common with the Madeira archipelago, much closer to Africa and to one another, similar climate, much bigger islands
The Azores, we're smaller islands with the exception of the capital one, gets hot in the summer but not as much as and usually year round it's a lot more damp and since we're closer to the artic we get a very above freezing but chilling northern draft when the wind changes
Last year I and my mom were in northern mainland at the start of winter and 10 centigrade there felt like 16 here, people there complained about the humidity but we thought it was plenty good
The timezone is one hour less than the mainland but I think it should be two hours less, we're far enough to geographically justify it but not geopolitically, like going up across the northern portuguese border changes the timezone for Spain, a remnant of the Axis times during the war and nothing else
Funny thing is, our military base is the only one with a military radio station and  every hour we get an update "são X horas nos Açores, uma hora a mais no Continente e na Madeira" it's almost always said like that, every hour, of every day, and I and many others know it by heart, starts and ends with a jingle with a clock in the background
>Naturally northern Portugal has more in common with Galicia and southern Portugal has more in common with Andalucia
And then you have Lisbon which doesn't seme to have an equivalent in the country next door
I've been to Madrid when I was a kid and the City looks completely different from Lisbon
Certainly more than Arabs and Berbers but not more than Catalans or Castilians
Lisbon is quite unique
Madrid also has its own culture that’s distinct from any other place
Barcelona is more similar to Lisbon but still pretty different
I’d say attitudes wise we have more in common with the south of Spain, in Lisbon
[A castle]
In Barreiro, Portugal, there are the factories and the train station, one of the oldest in the country
Caldas da Rainha is a small city where 30k people live
It has the world's oldest thermal hospital
I'm from Porto and I would say our main landmark is [Torre dos Clérigos] However, the most instagramable place here is for sure [Luís I Bridge] built by Gustave Eiffel
And it is important to not forget the most beautiful stadium in the World: [Estádio do Dragão]
C'mon everyone knows caldas because of the [CARALHOS DAS CALDAS]
In Portuguese it's martelo
has a rather soft sound to it tbh
In Portuguese it's "martelo", if it's sledgehammer then the word is "marreta"
Martelo in Portuguese but, as we speak with our mouths almost closed and our teeth clenched it sounds extremely badass
it doesn't mean the same thing
"Martelo" is a hammer, "marreta" is a sledgehammer
If they rent, I guess that they don't save anything and still have to borrow from their parents to be able to eat something
Entry level salaries for those who have work basically cover transport, rent, utilities aaaaand, you're broke
Indeed
That's why most people in their 20's still live with their parents
We have no money to move out because the rent is stupidly high for the amount of money we earn in a month
I'll be super happy if I get 900€ per month after I finish my masters degree, and that thought is sad as hell
1 bedroom apartments for more than 600€ in lisbon/porto
Insane when the minimum wage is 650€
Yup, and here in the Algarve the rent is crazy high, plus it’s so hard to find someone that’ll rent you an apartment for the entire year
É sempre avisos de Outubro a Maio apenas
That's awful
They just do it because they know they can charge more in the summer for tourists
E que se lixe quem vive cá o ano inteiro
É tudo uma bela merda
Eu vivo numa cidade do interior que não é nada de especial e por um t2/t3 já se paga 600€. É ridículo
Ainda estou para ver o excelente ordenado de engenheira mestre que vou receber
Ao menos é um curso que dá para ter emprego
Nós de letras não se arranja nada
Tirei tradução e é impossível arranjar trabalho
Já está tudo ocupado e quem ainda precisa de tradutor prefere pedir aos amigos que sabem “falar bem inglês” do que pagar a alguém com um curso
Enfim, este país vai de mal a pior mas também não estou com planos de emigrar portanto tenho de comer e calar
Já eu cada vez mais penso em sair daqui
Somos muito pequeninos em mentalidade e é exatamente isso que tu dizes, se aparece alguém que faz de graça porquê pagar
Acontece exatamente o mesmo nas empresas de engenharia, se há engenheiros que aceitam o ordenado minimo, para quê pagar mais
É muito triste quando se lê certos comentários neste post de pessoas a poupar 1000€ por mês quando aqui em Portugal é raríssima a pessoa que o consegue fazer
Exacto, também vi e fiquei em choque
Há pouco tempo pensei que tinha arranjado um projecto para traduzir um site para uma advogada, falou comigo, mandou me os textos mais técnicos para ela ver se eu achava que era algo demasiado exigente
Matei ali duas horas a ver os textos e a analisar para lhe dar um orçamento, mandei mensagem a dizer 130€  porque era capaz de ser uma 10 horas por volta do site
Não me respondeu, passado uns dias vieram-me dizer que ela tinha pedido antes ao amigo que sabia “inglês bom o suficiente”. Fui ver o site que está agora completo, tá uma bela treta
Escolha dela
Isso dói na alma
Na minha opinião 130€ é um preço excelente para a tradução de um website
Não é um trabalho simples
Yup, eu por norma cobro 13€ por hora, nem pedi mais por ser técnico nem nada como ainda comecei agora
Mas pronto, PORTUGAL, amirite
Boa sorte para nós haha
Boa sorte para nós!!
Since our northern part of the country has more people than our southern part, I would expect this switch to stimulate construction in the south and the development of new businesses down there, while businesses in the north would face a tremendous time finding new employees, which would probably make the central government develop new immigration policies - this ignoring the freedom of movement inside the country
Not sure how this south and north scenario applies to our Atlantic islands though
You meant Atlantis, right
I like al corona
What kind of oil
I like Molisana and Garofalo
They also both make the only edible whole wheat pasta I ever tried
Barilla meh
A local supermarket has a own brand Italian pasta which is actually very good, basically garofalo
Sometimes it is really hard to not judge Americans and their food and cooking
Molisana is easy to find in continente supermarkets and sometimes it is even 50% off and pingo doce has garofalo and their own brand Italian pasta which is good
To be honest I do not like Spanish brands either, Italian is better
Nacional is too mushy though their vegetable colored pasta is actually ok or at least enough of my family likes it

"Shocks" is a bit of a strong word
I'm sure some things surprise them, but most don't shock them
Maybe the fact we still have bullfighting in 2019 does, though
That's the closest thing I can think of
The banana republics refer to the countries of Central America
In the first half of the 20th century the USA overthrew some governments in the area and replaced them with politicians that favoured the fruit companies that owned land in the countries

I remember doing it once in primary school but that's about it
For me  personally I know I’ll probably live with my parents till mid 20’s and have kids I hope in my 30’s :) my parents had me at 40/39 and that worked well so im thinking of doing the same
Not really I don’t think
Everyone knows how hard it is for young people to find a decent job and accommodation
In my experience, it’s even seen as irresponsible to bring a kid into that

I don’t think people care that much
Some people want to and do it, but it’s up to you really

What stereotypes do you have for different regions of your country
In Portugal's case:
- **Minho**: bunch of farmers and fishermen,  yokels who swear like sailors, funny accent, where people actually work for a living
- **Trás dos Montes**: even more farmers, cold
- **Interior**: unknown territory with montains, people often forget it's part of the country, so many sheep
- **Centro**: Coimbra, land of students
Only the litoral matters, the rest is uncharted territory
- **Lisbon**: high maintenance, too many people and too many snobs, if you don't live here you're a peasant
Pansies whose ears start to bleed if they hear a swear word
- **Alentejo** - the desert, even more farmers with funny accents who call every man 'compadre'. Literal Hell during the summer
- **Algarve** - England with beaches and lot's of oranges
- **Azores** - indecipherable dialect, lot's of cows
- **Madeira** - island of bananas, could totally be independent if they wanted, birth place of Cristiano Ronaldo
Do you have sterotypes for different regions in your country
This is not a stereotype, this is true ahahah
What the hell is happening in Corsica
You guys need to leave the island
People don't associate the Basque Country to ETA anymore
I have to ask: what is it with you guys and our towels
Wasn't Napoleon from there
Aaand my Bolognese pasta is ruined
That explains so much
Carbonara would make more sense though
Well, I'm portuguese, living in France, 5km away from Luxembourg and Belgium
Sometimes I go to Germany for shopping (not so much now with covid)
My boyfriend is Italian and we go sometimes to Italy by car (8h travel) crossing Switzerland
Pretty normal for us now, but I remember when I moved here, it was all pretty new and I was always excited every time I crossed a border hahaha
I've only left my country once, went to France by car
Took me 2 days to get there and it was awesome, now sure 2 days is quite a lot but that's how long it would take to go from some US states to other US states (i think)
When the borders open again, it will be special
I miss my neighbors
It is kinda of mind boggling when you are used to one thing all your life and then visit the other place
I've been to the US to visit friends and we drove from North Carolina to New York, it took almost an entire day and we were still in the same country, in Portugal a 3 hour drive is a huge trip
No one in continental Portugal lives further than a 3 hour drive from Spain
I, myself live about 100 quilometres from the border and it wasn't unusual to go to Spain for lunch or a night out from time to time
Yeah its kinda stupid how you literally can just go north to Galicia and when you get there you change Time zone even tho nothing really changes
That’s true
But not everybody goes there often
No one in continental Portugal lives further than a 3 hour drive from ~~Spain~~ the empty wasteland that is the western face of the central plateau of the distance
Outside Galicia and Badajoz, the "closest" things are a bit further out than 3 hours
You have to drive a bit more to Zamora, Salamanca or Seville, and a bit further still for Madrid
Plenty of cool small things to see, but that's a lot of trips to take
I can see that, I'd imagine they use the same work hours as us and most countries with a more suitable timezone, if i feel like shit when it's  that part of winter and i wake up still in the night imagine doing it for a longer period every year, explains a lot about spanish people (partially joking)
We also have them in Portugal
And almost every house has them too
They're useful, but they're not really "aesthetic". Plus they make so much noise
They are common in Portugal too
In Portugal it's mandatory by the law for a newly built house to have a bidet
Who in Portugal uses the bidet to wash their butt instead of toilet paper
Few people
Bidet is used mostly for washing feet and accumulate dirty laundry that will eventually go to the washing machine
I totally agree you, I also use the bidet mostly to wash my feet during summer, but the fact is that even though we don't really use it that much, it's mandatory to have a bidet at home
Uhm, it's actually used by women, too
Who wouldn't, at night
It’s the same in Portugal
One awesome idea I had no notion existed and I saw when I visited the US a few years ago:
\- Drive through ATM Bank Machines
No need to look for and take up parking space just to run to the ATM for 2 minutes
There are public bathrooms here that are free, but most of the time they're pretty disgusting
As for using the bathrooms in shops, cafés and restaurants, it's only fair that you pay to use them (or be a customer) because it still costs the owners
At least in Portugal, *public* bathrooms are all free
Private "public" bathrooms, aka bathrooms in owned establishments such as cafés and restaurants aren't, you're meant to buy something, aka use the establishment if you want to yknow, use the establishment's services, such as the bathroom
This goes to the extent of some cafés having locked bathrooms and a key which the costumers can ask for
Looking at it, for the costumers of the establishment, the bathroom in the end of the day is free
Narrow streets, barely no parking space, labyrinthic street layouts
but this only applies to old quarters of the cities, old cities are not 100% old infrastructure
Reminds me of my parents' café. The building is quite old and I remembering taking measurements inside (we were refurbishing it) and being amazed at just how inconsistent everything was
No measure was repeated
it's not a choice between only those two
old city centers have a mess of cul-de-sacs, one way streets, two way streets that only fit a car at a time and serpentine streets that are not intuitive to cross
I normally say that I'll never vote for the Communist Party, although I respect them
Yup, it has seats in the Parliament and has been one of the parties that supports the Socialist Party government
Lately they've been in involved in some controversies envolving Labour Day, their annual party, and their annual congress (convention)
Excuses in advance for any grammar mistake
Baby Jesus Christ stopped being the main gift bringer and was swapped by Santa Claus
In my region each parish has it's own celebration called Merendeiras, where it's given some blessed bread
Every village that belongs to the parish has it's own representative for that year, called Mordomo, that it's responsible for the religious ceremony and to make a party at their house
But because this is very expensive and there are fewer people in the countryside, there are less and less people taking part of it
We also have the Bolinho/Pão por Deus, on the 1st of November, where the kids go door to door asking for treats for Saints
But once again, we have very few kids nowadays
This day has nothing to do with Halloween, as many people ask me if it's the same
Carnaval is becoming less and less relevant than it was in my parent's time and even then it was much bigger in my grandparents time
Children have school holidays and they might wear fancy clothes for kindergarten parties and some towns got organized parties and events and all but honestly it is something young people just do not much participate
The June saint festivals still huge though
When i see this controversy I always think of [this]
My parents never told me it was Jesus who delivered presents
The again we're not religious
yeah, but somewhere in the 80/90s he decided to outsource to that Turkish guy living in Finland
I don't doubt you but Baby Jesus Christ is the traditional gift bringer
Bullfighting is also disappearing in Portugal, every year that passes it is less and less popular
As the population grows urban, it becomes a more alien reality for everyone
Bullfighting squares are being brought-down and converted to other venues
You still have small towns with their annual bull runs, but that is a different thing
Unfortunately, I believe like in Spain, it has become a contentious political issue which will surely contribute to attract people to the fights and keep it alive just a little bit longer
However, its demise will not be free of down sides
The raising of the bulls ensures that a traditional agro-ecossytem of extensive pastures and low density oak forests is economically viable, and that a breed of cows, which are genetically much closer to the native wild cows of the Iberian peninsula and are a important vault of genetic biodiversity, are kept alive
I think we will find ourselves in a place where, the breed isn't economically viable on its own, and we will need to subsidize it, just to ensure that we keep the biodiversity of both the breed and the ecosystem
He's a baby in December but ages to be a grown man just in time to die in Easter
ah, ah
That road has got loads of space and it is just soft stuff on either side
The problem here is very narrow roads with tall stone walls on both sides
Like this
(I am actually impressed the google maps car attempted it)
And then there are some places in Sintra, which are like that but STEEP and with curves
Google maps can point at some surprising places
I dunno, pray a bit and just go carefully and if your car is big turn back at some places, but do not get very big cars if you live in this city
edit
adding a few more  in case you are interested
Also not obvious on google maps, there is  steepness factor sometimes which does not really "show" as intimidating on google streetview or photos but which is trust me, a thing when driving
Second gear is your best friend, for everything
It is what it is, no wimping out
Some of these places they got delivery vans and trucks coming by
Honestly I have no trouble with narrow roads
I don't consider myself to be a great driver, but narrow and tight roads have never been an issue to
Part of it may have been due to having had a lot of driving lessons inside villages and on dodgy mountain roads
I actually get a bit more anxious driving inside busy cities and, oddly enough, makeshift car parks despite the latter also involving driving through tight spaces and corners
I wish I had a dollar
sorry euro
for every scratch & dent on the cars I see in Sintra
Ah yes, flashback to when I used Google maps to navigate somewhere near Serra da Estrela and I ended up on a stupidly narrow street in the middle of a small village, right after a curve I couldn't back out of
Had to pull off the mirrors of my SUV and navigate using cameras, the motherfucker was beeping all over
But it's a fun challenge
There will be signs if it is specially narrow
Obviously it is one way only
In these narrow streets, you can also see the dents and scratches in the walls of the buildings, especially when the roads curve
Some are even so much dented, it's now literally easier to make the curve
Or Lisbon
There are some interesting parking lots as well (Pingo Doce being particularly bad at this
I could not even find on google streetview (wimps
) the really impressive lanes in Sintra, or the good roads in the smaller Azores islands
But ok, ok, we win
Lisbon is an interesting place to learn how to drive
( and OMG you should see some adapted supermarket parking lots
> why would they build these walls so close to each other in the first place
Because that was the edge of their land, on either side, and when the walls were built the lane was wide enough for existing traffic, like people on foot or horse carts
Duh
Google maps, any automatic navigation thing can be pretty bad
Lisbon can be tricky as well, and you can add parked cars, granite cobblestones, steepness in general
Somebody was asking here some days ago why automatic transmission cars were not popular, and bitches please, second gear is my best friend and I will use first if I need to (my father has got a fancy automatic transmission car and it is fucking embarrassing how stupid it is and how often it will go down on traffic lights on inclines
Not for me)
As interesting as the mainland is, the islands can be well, even more challenging
The Azores are like 99
9% perfectly heavenly driving (hydrangeas
cute cows
velvet like asphalt
the view) and 0
1% fuck it, fuck it, fuck it
Or with traffic lights
A few times yeah
Once driving on a road I did not know, there is a traffic light flashing red some 40 meters way from the crossing (which had houses)
Obviously I stop thinking WTF, this is stupid
Then I understand, from the right hand road from the crossing there is a bus coming, and it is making several manouvers to position itself around that crossing occupying the lane I would have been in
It was a really sharp angled house on that corner, narrow roads
I guess the buses have a remote control for the traffic light
I do not do miles
Check where you are and adjust
And apparently according to an eagle eyed danish redditor, some of those are not one way
Which makes sense because they might be the only way in for some people to bring their stuff home
Such is life
>Why were the roads recessed in the first place
Why go to the trouble of digging those channels and putting walls on either side instead of just building "normal" roads
Because normal road width was not standartized till what 20th century
Because roads were often places where properties met and to use by foot traffic or animal pulled carts
These roads, these properties are OLD
To change it you need to expropriate property which is complicated legally, needs a strong reason and IMO is not something to use lightly
In case this is a factor, and hope this is not a cultural stereotype thing, maybe you are used to urban city centres being rebuilt strongly after world war 2
In Lisbon centre, or Portugal as a whole, the last real wars were first half of the 19th century
There has not been any "opportunity" to tear down old roads and do modern stuff
400 meters
4 km
Isn't that so much better than fractions
backing off 400 meters, yeah it happens

If the UK belongs in Europe or not, it is up to them, no judgement from my side
The perspective is a little confusing so I'm not sure but I don't think it's that significantly bellow ground level
There's this a gate the beginning of the street [ The bottom of the image is distorted but I can't see a significant height difference
>Europe is a continent
Kind of
Because we say it is
I dunno
If we consider Europe a continent Great Britain and Ireland are islands off it right
When we speak of Portugal we speak of continental Portugal and non continental Portugal
I believe in self-affirmation
If Europeans can say Europe is a continent, brits can also say they are not part of that continent
That would either be [Gente da Minha Terra] (people from my land), because of theme of the lyrics and it's a Fado classic, or Grândola Vila Morena
This last one is the song that celebrates the ending of fascism and the Carnation Revolution
This [video] is a scene from a movie (realistic) of that and where the song plays, so you understand the context
It is definitely "Minha Casinha", by the band Xutos e Pontapés.
It already had a status close to the one in question in the past, but that status was solidified after the euro2016 final
Tun tun tun tun tun tun tuuun
Tun tun tuun - tun tun tuun
The lyrics "so jung und doch so alt" really hit it right IMO
I think of either Kraftwerk or NEUNUNDNEUZIG LUFTBALLONS AUF IHREN WEG ZUM HORIZONT
Thanks for sharing, they are great
I would suggest also [USA] and [Free
mp3]
And also Xutos and Pontapés' song "Minha Casinha" !
Or the iconic song by current Candidate to Portugal’s Presidency “[Pão com Manteiga] (literally “bread and butter”)
The Portuguese named Cabo Verde (Green Cape) after a cape in Senegal, that they themselves called Cabo Verde (nowadays Cap-Vert), and it's messed up, because they are hundreds of kilometres apart
The islands are very dry actually, not that green
There's a city in Portugal called Portalegre, which translates to "Happy Port" (Porto = Port, Alegre = Happy)
The thing is that it's situated inland and isn't surrounding any body of water, which begs the question as to why they named it that
there's a town called Vila Nova de Milfontes in southern Portugal, which translates to New Town of a Thousand Fountains
It has no fountains in sight and is located on one of the driest regions in the country
Lived there for a whole semester
I wondered why there were so many boat logos, especially on travel agencies
Is there any story behind it
I think I heard once that the reason for the name is that the houses were built with wrecked boat scraps
I live in the Guadiana Valley and I can confirm, the river's quite rivery
Lots of riverness
an interesting thing about Carthago:
it was founded as a colony by the Phoenicians who headed west
Later, Carthago headed west and founded a colony called Cartagena in Spain
Centuries later, people from Cartagena went west and founded Cartagena de las Indias in Colombia
That is a legitimate fear
However, this is already happening
Not because big countries are overpowering small countries, but because globalization makes multinational companies able to pick and choose where they do business and pay taxes, which removes some national sovereignty, especially in smaller countries
Maybe forming a block of countries as the EU has is a good idea to counter-act this phenomenon, and the fear of losing control to big countries could be mitigated through a framework of states' rights and degressive proportionality (the latter already exists in the EU Parliament)
And it's basically inevitable
The reason dialects sprung in the first place was because different communities were isolated from each other, leading to the development in the way they spoke in different directions
With the Internet and other forms of globalization, we are closer to other communities than ever, and so our speech is more similar than it would have been
It's outlandish to think the central EU government would make everyone learn German or English as their first language
I think the US is now ahead of the EU in terms of GDP (even with the UK still in the EU), but you're right about the influence of EU regulations outside of the EU
There's even a term for it: the [Brussels effect]
Spain is far from perfect, but in Catalonia they have 'language immersion,' in which they learn subjects in both Catalan and Castilian (at least 25% as per the Supreme Court)
But you're right, there aren't many good examples for this, and Spain could do better to respect language diversity
> The only one which could possibly used as an example is Switzerland
And it's pushing it tbh, aside from it being an incredibly unique country you'd be hard pressed to find a Swiss person who didn't speak (swiss) German to a decent level
I would argue that a European Federation would also be an incredible unique country, and that there's nothing wrong with having a common 2nd (or 3rd for some countries) language between all countries, because it would certainly be English, which every country already teaches from a young age
The thing that I believe would set us apart is that you can't force one language when there is no majority support for that language
And in a Federation of 24 languages, either public opinion in many countries has drastically changed, or you're not touching education with a 10 meter (ha) pole
The largest language group is German of which there are 80 million in the EU, while the rest of the EU is 370 million (not including the UK)
I don't see French people ever giving up on speaking French
I have a great work life/personal life balance I can't complain, I sleep well, I have time during the day to have lunch and yeah I leave at 18:00 and can do whatever I want
During both lock downs in Portugal, I had the hardest time sleeping
I'm a teacher and teaching from home isn't active enough for me
I don't think you need that time off in the middle of the day if you work in an office or any other place indoors but, if you work outdoors, in the Iberian Peninsula that mid day time is pretty awful
I know because I worked in agriculture for some time
After mid day you sit and wait the hottest hours out
This might have changed, though
I stopped working in the fields a long time ago
Happy cake day
Halloween and Black Friday are the probably the biggest ones
I'd say Albufeira
Used to be a small fishing village but was then developed haphazardly into a tourist destination
It's the kind of place you go for a cheap, tacky holiday
So much of the bars, restaurants, and other services are marketed primarily towards tourists and expats, and so expect to see a lot of signage in English only
There's also a large number of foreigners living there, from all sorts of countries socio-economic backgrounds
I've worked there in the past and would have customers (as well as co-workers) from all over
The place feels a bit weird to me to be honest, like I've stepped into another dimension
There are still some very Portuguese parts of the city, and some remnants of the old village, but generally speaking it's become too much of a holiday destination, one which wasn't planned out very well
In the same region you have the district capital Faro, which I feel is very typically Portuguese (in both the good and bad)
Portugal is pretty much Portugal
The southern part has some Arab influences on the architecture but nothing similar to what you have in Granada for example
Not really a city but a region, the region of Algarve, it feels more like, idk, Miami other than your average portuguese city/region
Also Vilamoura, it looks like a weird portuguese version of a small town in Florida, it doesn't look like Portugal, even Albufeira is more Portuguese
I see
I haven't been to Albufeira, but I've been to Vilamoura
This was 20 years ago already though
I vaguely remember it being some huge marina like place with restaurants surrounding the ocean
I've been to Ceuta and it felt like I was in Morocco
Only difference being the signage was in Spanish
From a foreigners perspective
To me typical Spain has  that distinct red earth colour
Sevilla and zamorra feel very Spanish to me
Maybe Barcelona the less Spanish because of how it's built
Vilamoura is a bit weird yes, but I suppose I'm so used to it that I don't even notice it anymore
I've shown some friends from out of town around Vilamoura and they all found it quite artificial (which it totally is)
It's also guilty of that tacky "holiday villa" architecture style, but I will admit I like the greenery and town infrastructure
Also forgot to mention Almancil
While it looks like a very Portuguese town, I always feel a bit uncomfortable there as it's very much trying to go for that boujee tourist/expat crowd, at least when it comes to its restaurants, so many of them having English names and signage
It's funny you mention Florida because that's exactly how I think of some parts of the Algarve
You've got a lot of young people coming on holiday alongside a large number of retired pensioners
Yeah the marina is a big part of the place
Other than that you have two beaches and a lot of golf courses
Also the two biggest nightclubs in the region, at least during the summer
There's also a pleasant nature reserve
It's quite artificial but there are some nice spots to hang around in
It's an amazing place to be in Erasmus
I agree on Albufeira and Vilamoura but Almancil the village itself I don’t think so, mostly because in the village the community is mostly Portuguese and expats but not English
For English it’s more Quinta do Lago, Vale do Lobo which for me are the most foreign places even
Let me guess, you're an "avec", aren't you
(No offense intended, just a joke)
Oh I definitely didn't go to the nightclubs or the golf course
I was 10 at the time
I mean the earth not the buildings
Sorry I wasn't too clear
That's always a sign I've crossed a boarder to spain
If I'm not wrong it's because it's a clay-like soil, that's got his drainage and is great for wine
I wasn't speaking about architecture
I know it's not all like that but It's a fairly common stereotype
I meant the actual ground, because if the clay terrains sorry I wasn't clear
Your right, it's mostly the restaurants and some shops in Almancil
Quinta do lago and vale do lobo are non-gated communities which have some gated communities inside by basically probably 1% are Portuguese if so, are luxury house complexes completely foreign places for local people
If you drove around from Loulé onwards until Spain less and less foreign places you will find
There a big Uk community around Tavira there are some villas like those you find in Albufeira but still Quinta do Lago and Vale do Lobo it’s not just UK
Honestly Portuguese grammar is hard enough now trying to make people make the correct sounds to speak its going to be impossible not even the Brazilians speak like we do
Side note: a friend of mine her mom is from south Africa and has been living in Portugal for almost 40 years and she still has a very very tick accent
Because it would make me feel less special and lazier to learn other languages
I don't want to live in a world where everyone speaks Portuguese to some degree
Maybe a "fair language" that everyone had to lear os Esperanto
Its based mainly on european Languages
Almost everyone under 30 speaks English
France fought to keep England out of the Union and prevent the increase of American influence
No one cared
Now, it’s best we just go along with it
As much as it saddens me, I can’t think of a single reason for any language other than English to be picked
Much less, my own
Almost no one will learn it as well as they do English, cause they’re not bombarded with media 24-7 in any other language
Why portuguese should become the next pan-european language: it would make us more popular, then more tourists would come, then our broke country would make more money
Why portuguese should not become the next pan-european language: it's super complicated
Who says french can easily learn any other language
They are terrible at any other language, and actively suppress the usage of other languages in their country
They dub everything, they have a mandatory quota of daily music in french for all radio stations
Their ridiculous idea of cultural preservation and their annoying and arrogant accent make them terrible at literally all other languages
We had a time like that some years ago
Now, every time someone says, let's go back to the old orthography, we tell them to shut up
It was hard enough to learn the new one
Oh, I'd like that
Portuguese grammar is a clusterfuck
Even more so with the new Accord
But in essence it's very logical and vocabulary rich
But if it's even hard for natives, how would we expect others to learn it
I do like how Å looks like an A with a halo and wonder if you guys use it for your equivalent of the word "Angel". I find the idea amusing
Incredible reasoning
Other people presenting arguments:
-...That’s why I think it’d be easier
Luxembourgish:
-Just make it hard for everybody
See, I have read this explanation before, or something along its' lines, to justify french being the lingua franca, in the 18 hundreads
I just don't remember who or where I read it from
I think it was Victor Hugo in "L'homme qui rit", but I'm not sure
Are you guys taught about these things in school or was this just a happy coincidence
It would be a total nightmare if everyone suddenly learned Portuguese
They would surely do it the lazy way and learn Brazilian Portuguese, which would infuriate every single European Portuguese speaker
And if they tried to learn Portuguese from Portugal, everyone would do it terribly
>I'm a fan of latin though can't we just use that like in the old times
I studied Latin for a bit in HS and dropped it quickly
No thanks
Just think how much easier the spelling would be for everyone, though
I think that if you provided them a draft, most bureaucrats would be up to the task
It's not that hard, specially compared with other European languages like German, Finnish or Icelandic
southern europeans would have a heart attack
Yeah, but everyone would go deaf in 2 years
Wrong
Portuguese has more verb tenses and a more flexible sentence structure
You can say "amo-te" or you can say "te amo", you can say "a rich man" or "a man rich", as simple examples
As saying "I'm doing something" in the present, you've at least 3 verb tenses: "faço" , "estou a fazer", "fazendo". All these differences carry a different nuance that's hard for non-natives to grasp since there's no equivalent
It's also hard for natives
The pronoun "você" it's not really a thing
The correct one is "vós", the second person of plural
But nobody uses it because conjugation is too difficult
Also vocabulary is broader
I'm a native and I need a dictionary by my side if I'm reading a book originally written in Portuguese
Can't really compare with those, because I'm not fluent in them
But look at [this guy] How many people you know speak like him
He speaks super correct Portuguese
Or even, how many people you know use the 2 person of plural correctly or even at all
ahaha
You just read my mind
Because, after reading that swedish also has Å, I was considering asking how you guys spelt angel
I think you mean half of Luxembourg is Portuguese (which is still an hyperbole but much closer to reality)
Either way, there’s no reason I’d have an advantage
That’s like saying it’s easy for a Japanese to learn Portuguese just because Brazil has the largest Japanese community outside Japan
It's similar, yes, but more broad
There's a lot of verb tenses and nuances
The language is very very vast and takes a long time to master
I'm 25 and I still need to have a dictionary with me when I'm reading a book originally written in Portuguese
On the plus side, it's very versatile
Which one of them
I vote for caló.
We already have co-opted a lot of it as our slang, so I feel like I could use that as a learning stepping stone
It is almost the same here in Portugal, and if you miss understand one of those specious expressions, you end up paying fines
I didn't really understand what the video is supposed to show
I mean, half of the words there I haven't used in years, if at all, and I'm a native speaker
No no no, I disagree just because
Yes, I was comparing with the other Romance languages, not German
For when you said this
>Portuguese grammar is like the grammar of all roman languages beautifully easy
You can't compare a language that evolved unbridled through more than 1000 years with modern Spanish and Italian, which were reviewed for purposes of unifying the respective countries relatively recently
giving itself to Spain like a pussy bitch back in the 16th century
I would say participating in WW1
Uhhh in recent history, letting Salazar in to power and fascistic regime
Overall history : slave trade and letting King Sebastian be raised by Catholic war mongers and noble War mongers
OLIVENÇA É NOSSA
Sweet, sweet karma
nope, just a failure
But the thing is the king had other noble Portuguese cosiness in Portugal that could and were even more legitimate to being heir to the thrown
Although the at least its just a royal union that we were able to overthrow and lasted only 60 years

I still wear a coat with between 20 and 25 °C.
Living in a university town with lots of exchange students, it's easy to spot the ones from cold countries just by the lack of clothing they wear compared to locals right now
I'm wearing big coats, scarves and gloves and they're going around in t-shirts
Im depressed when the sun sets at 6pm
Not really a plot hole it's just: HOW COULD THEY LET A COLLEGE TEACHER BECOME A DICTATOR
Hahaha to be fair he was also minister of finance before becoming a dictator
And a coffee cookie
Unfortunately he had an irredeemably bad taste in flags
Das ende ist der anfang und der anfang ist das ende /r/DarK

You're about as fluent as my uncle, then
Oh I love that
I only know "kurwa" in Polish
I am very impressed by that
Very useful, as well
We could bond over the fact I can only say spierdalaj
Yeah
I like how to them "retrospective" sounds more posh than "hindsight", when to me the latter one is the more obscure word
[Académica de Coimbra]
The new one doesn't even have the lettering above and it looks even better imo
I like to drive thru the streets of Porto at night listening to midnight city by M83
10/10 would adopt it as our backing track
In fact the whole album where it comes from
Edit : link to the song in case you don't know it
Edit 2 - Oh boy, I'm ashamed
Called the artist M84 instead of M83
Definitely thos one
It's a traditional Portuguese song from a renowned Portuguese Fado singer
a lo-fi remix of "A garagem da vizinha" by Quim Barreiros
Oblivion has such a great soundtrack
LOL
Where are you from btw
I think that's the wrong link
Yeah, I was kidding since he literally sings the opposite of Fado, the genre of music he sings is called musica pimba in Portugal, basically yeah songs full of sexual innuendo
Oh I see
Os Bichos da Fazenda is awesome too
Maybe our university tradition of wearing a black capes but them it wouldn't ld be unique to us anymore, so I'm not going to share that since it's to cool, maybe instead our love for the sea and our delicious dishes and or melancholic yet hopeful and sad Portuguese poetry (Fernando Pessoa and his multiple personalities poems, Camões poems and "Os lusíadas" , Eça de Queiroz "Os Maias", Saramago etc
), or our boarder stability and strong sense of unity and nacional pride (oldest consistent board in Europe and world
Bacalhau
We'll give you safety with bonus *Calçada Portuguesa*.
Free of charge
Our safety
Portugal is one of the safest countries in the world
I think that would be more suitable for the Portuguese to offer xP oldest consistent board and a strong sense of unity
dude
how about our hospitality or "saudade"?...
Pasteis de nata aswell
I was hoping this wouldn't be the top comment for Portugal
Goddammit
What strikes me most since moving to Portugal is drivers braking for pedestrians
Seems like a small thing, but completely changes the stress level when walking around
my dude he is clearly joking
Spain has no territorial stability
most spanish people don't even want to be spanish
True, but saudades would be hard because although it has direct translation in terms of coloquial context it doesn't have a true translation that's capable of translating both the emotional melancholy/sadness/anxiety and culture meaning because that word evolve to have that because of historical and cultural of the Portuguese i think that would be hard to both explain and convert to a foreign language and culture, plus there are the  Tuga dumbasses that don't understand  why saudades doesn't have a true direct translation in to other languages and it's unique to us and just replay with "about "missing" " but forget that the culture and emotional context that our has doesn't have a true equivalent
I, unlike a typical Portuguese trait, do not tardy
Yeah we don't need any more
I know that's why i put "xP" , i just trying to join in on the joke :)
Edit error (my dyslexia was hungry ate a few words)
In Portugal, “Betos” or “betinhos” for entitled children/youngsters, dunno where it comes from
“Mãe-Galinha, Pai-Galinha ou Pais-Galinha” for a helicopter mother, father or parents
Galinha means chicken in portuguese so go figure
Same in Portuguese, "mãe galinha".
We also say «meninos mimados»
Even though I don’t understand a bit I think Romanian might be my favourite foreign european language to hear or read just like my dutch favorites
Like sometimes I really get a kick just hearing that famous dutch bakery TV chef speaking on 24kitchen
I gotta find something similar in Romanian lol
Big hug from Portugal
I was born and raised in Porto , and I've never been to Livraria Lello (considered to be one of the most beautiful book stores ever, and also one of the major inspirations for the Harry Potter franchise)
I'm from Cascais, lived there until I was about 25, and still live in the Lisbon area
I've visited more or less all the tourist sites around here
However, I've never visited the [Peninha] which is just a few kms from my parent's place
It has a beautiful view over the Cabo da Roca / Cascais coastline, but for this and that, I've never been there
I went there two years ago, but when we arrived it was raining heavily and we were with the kids, so at the end decided that it wasn't a good idea to visit it
You're not supposed to visit sites near you
If you want to visit something, you have to go abroad
I went there and enjoyed it
Was supposed to visit Stirling castle as well but it was bit expensive
Fair enough—I skipped it the first few times I went to Porto because the line outside was so massive
I don't remember anything for counting seconds but something we do is counting 1 elefante, 2 elefante (1 elephant, 2 elephant) as a way to know how far lightning strick's, or fireworks or whatever really
Each elephant you count is half a kilometer
So if you see lightning, then count to 5 and hear the thunder you know it hit 2
5km away
It takes around 1
4-1
5sec to say it, wich at the speed of sound is really close to .5km
For counting seconds, from where I'm from we would usually go, 1 e 2 e 3 e.... (1 and 2 and 3 and
I learned it has "1 crocodilo, 2 crocodilos, 3 crocodilos, etc
". For the non portuguese speakers is crocodilo = crocodile, just in case you didn't guess it haha
Well yes, but actually no XD
Never hear that one
Which region are you from
Ribatejo over here
I use "crocodilo" in Portuguese as well
Basically in every contry you get a job if you go for medicine
There's a few food-related ones:
* [Sugar-coated] or [chocolate-coated] almonds being the typical Easter treat
* The mid-afternoon meal lanche, basically a snack to keep us going between lunch and dinner
* The amount of rice we eat compared to other European countries and the fact that we heat up olive oil and onion in the pot before cooking rice by default
* Speaking of which, rice and potatoes in the same dish being acceptable
* Restaurants providing, for many dishes, a "dose" and a "half-dose", where the half-dose is typically for one person and the full dose is meant to be shared, and a half-dose costs more than half the price of a dose
I've heard that our daily TV news programmes are way longer than what's normal elsewhere, they last for more than an hour typically
Don't know how true that is though
Eating a lot of cod
Im sorry, what
Come to Alentejo then, we have the best bread in Portugal
Same in Portugal
There's always bread on the table
They're the standard shutters here in Portugal, we call them persianas
Always thought they were only so widespread here and in Spain
> it’s called merenda
That's interesting
In some places in Portugal we use the same word
Hmm, growing up I thought it was an absolutely necessary step, except for Asian rices like basmati and stuff
> I guess you really like to be thorough
Not really, it's just to fit the 20 minutes of football talk and the other 20 of politicians speaking without really saying anything
In Portugal we often have morning and afternoon talk shows that usualy go for 3 to 5 hours
The news usual go for 1 hour to 1 hour and a half
We do, but it's usually considered bland, so unless it goes as a side to something with a stronger flavor, it's allways rice made with something else
If you were to ask my grandma, she would barely be able to start a rice dish without diced onions and olive oil
We do, but we do the olive oil thing before we put the water in
I actually do mean that, among other things
[I actually made a thread on this]  in the past if you want more details and thoughts on that
Hum hum (trás os montes)
Googling them is confusing me actually, especially because I get lots of Brazilian results and the usage of the word (and maybe the popularity of these blinds too) may be different
But anyway, it seems like persianas is more general than just that type of blinds but it's the word we use for them here
What's wrong with Macau
[this] is a little bit higher
Don't forget the gold
We sold metals like volfrâmio to both sides during ww2
Not many know about it, although from what i know it was the only way to maintain neutrality
thankfully we were able to give the allies the navel base in the middle Atlantic, in a way helping punch the nazi cunt
Meh, I don't doubt that but underdevelopment was just the common state of Portugal, colonies or metropolis, up until a few decades ago
IIRC even China liked us having Macau since we had no real strength to hold it in anything but name
I'm quite vehemently critical of how portuguese history is leonized but I don't understand that criticism of the wolfram/tungsten trade to the Axis
Like Sweden and iron it was only logical for diplomatic and economic reasonos to export ores to Nazi Germany
>although from what i know it was the only way to maintain neutrality
That's not true but it did help out good relations with Germany
>thankfully we were able to give the allies the navel base in the middle Atlantic, in a way helping punch the nazi cunt
The Salazar regime was in most of the instances axis-aligned
When Hitler died there was national morning for 3 days
>  thankfully we were able to give the allies the navel base in the middle Atlantic, in a way helping punch the nazi cunt
don't think we gave something we didn't really have or built
Madeira and Azores archipelagos are autonomous regions
They have their own government and some different laws
For instance, they have been applying slightly different rules for fighting Covid-19
Portugal has a couple archipelagos in the Atlantic, they have their autonomous bodies of government for more localized laws and regulations that fit the islands in all terms from cultural to economic that would clash with the mainland government that barely gives two shits about us; heck in the last election, because the far right wing party gained more seats and dethroned (albeit with the help of the center right party) the socialist party after 20+ years of majority lead, I've heard my countries politicians talk about my autonomous region more in the past 6 months than in the past 3 or 4 years
Tbh, other than that I really don't know in which areas are they responsible for
I'll never forget that time Cavaco Silva went on TV to tell us about the status of the Azores or wtv the hell he was rambling about
Me too
Constitutionally they are autonomous regions, but in practice it seems they are just more districts
Never seen those scissors around here but would buy them if I saw them for sale
I once bought a machete / axe from fiskars and it's like the best I've ever seen
I can cut a tree as thich as a bottle of beer with one swing and it doesn't even take much effort
Wouldn't go to a zombie apocalypse even without it
Has the shape of a machete,  with a much thicker blade and ...
...looked up vesuri on Google aaaaand
Yes, it's a Vesuri
History tell us that the French Empire failed to conquer Portugal three times in a row, although it was able to spread the terror onto Portuguese people and they pillaged some of our patrimony
We would, probably, boost our defense industry and the military spending and renforce our military cooperation with the UK, as we did in the past, to prepare for multiple invasion attempts by the French Empire and satellite states
Oh shit, here we go again
Hey, Britain, where are you at
Brazil is now my country
Here's a response: Portugal to England:" hey buddy want to kick some French ass like we did in the past
I have bottles of Porto "
Prety positively, considering 1812 weapons and vehicles are dogshit compared to 2020 weapons
Middle finger to them if they telling us to do something we dont want to
You want some help with that, our port are open
Prepare what
Pray for extra cold winter
Can we keep fishing their codfish
Didn't you guys got invaded and the royals substituted by napoleon's yes men
Our snails are better
Initiate Ice Age
Also Galiza and Olivença :D
We'd be looking at Britain hopefully
Good thing we can also kill uncultured chickens so easily
Is called "joke"
Well Portugal and England defeated the French invasions 3 times in row, so basically you guys got shafted for nothing and it was kinda deserving
Hmmm (no offence tho)
Ikr, this is part of me fantasizing in this alternative reality
We technically end up winning more than losing (the lost was mostly economic, but we won a lot in term of culture and in legal advancements like constitucional movement etc
I would say like 85% win and 15% lose overall, if analyse the time period before and after, I'm studying law and this is probably one of the most important events because the modern instruments and ideias introduced by the French invasions lead to the constitutional movement and codification movement was well the Liberal values and humanist values (we were one of the first to abolish the death penalty both in Europe and the world, we had a constitutional monarchy which it didn't last long but it lead to best possible form of political organisation which is a republic, etc
), he lost Brazil but it was for the best both for them and us, and it wasn't really cause by the French but more because the Prince was an idealist that prefer being in Brazil and because the Liberal forces weren't flexible with the demands
Not even regular dumplings are a thing here, much less fruit filled ones
I'd go to the nearest [bifana] vendor/joint I can find
At 4 am I step outside and eat some caldo verde and pão com chouriço [this]
Sandes de presunto would also be a great choice
Come on
Get real
At 11
45 we're all still sitting at the dinner table and the 4 beers we had, we had them with our meal
Since the next 4 will be at a nearby tasca, your bifanas are waiting for you behind the counter when you feel hungry ;)
This guy can into portuguese
If I'd have to choose ONE for Portugal, it would be the [Belém Tower]
and it’s on the coins
Oh yes for sure Palácio da Pena is pretty iconic
Belém tower was built in 1519, and Spanish ocupation was only from 1580 to 1640
Are you talking about the Belém tower
>Could It be also Palácio da Pena
I'd say it's not very culturally relevant
It seems to have had a bit of a popularity boom in the last decade or so due to the growth of tourism in the Lisbon area and foreigners tend to give it more importance than it actually has to us
Though maybe people from the Lisbon metro area have a different view on this
Up to you, normally people edit their comment with a line across the previously wrong statement from what I have seen on reddit
Parallel universe Europe that got transported here /s
Between 1580 and 1640, when we were occupied by the Spanish Filipes
Basically our king D. Sebastião disappeared while in Ceuta trying to conquer Africa from the north
He disappeared in the middle of the fog and never came back, he also didn't had any kids
We still have a running joke that he will return one day
There are two periods where **Portugal** was completely free:
**1139/1143 - 1580**
**1640 - today**
Between 1580 and 1640, we were under the rule of the same king as Spain but kept our crown separated from the Spanish one, and although we had a formal independent kingdom the successive kings we had in common were always messing around with our external policies
Napoleon's occupations in the 1800's also
For me was Paris
Disappointing
Berlin
Not the city itself, but I was pretty disappointed with the service in general
At the Deutsches Historisches Museum, no one at the reception desk spoke English (or they made a point not to)
I can kind of understand German, since I speak Dutch, but it came to a point where my mom had to say "achtung
" (she's a U2 fan) when handing in her camera at the cloakroom to indicate that it was fragile
I definitely don't expect everyone to speak English, but I think an effort should be made to achieve some form of communication when you're dealing with the public
I was also yelled at and told that I should go back to my country when I moved a chair out of the sun (I have chronic migraines and shouldn't be under direct sunlight)
We went to Berlin during a heatwave so it wasn't great for my head
I wish this part was bait but it's not
Bratislava
It's a tourist trap
Dunno if disappointed is the right word, but when I was a kid I went to Brussels and found it rather underwhelming
I believe it was the first foreign European capital I've visited in my life, so I was expecting something really cool, but Brussels really isn't much to write home about
And when I saw the Manneken Pis I was like "...ok that's it
Why is this such a known landmark
The Grand Place was kinda cool, though
Also, the first city I visited in Italy was Como and I found it boring and devoid of life
You always hear about Italy being a beautiful country, which is true, but you won't get that idea if the very first city in the country you visit is Como, believe me
Venice I didn't like that much but Florence completely blowed me away, cologne and berlin I did not enjoy at all but Hamburg and Frankfurt were great really liked them
When did you visit Paris
I went there in the 90s and in 2005
I enjoyed it both times
Agree
I went to Köln when I was a kid
I only remember the HUGE cathedral though
Yeah agree, went there a couple of months and ... I mean it's pretty and has a lot of places to visit but it's basically Tourist Town everywhere you go
I visited a lot of cities in the UK earlier this year and I have to say almost all were pretty bland compared to what I was expecting, the most disappointing being London and the biggest surprise being Birmingham
It's actually quite nice, except the Brummies accent
It's super funny to hear and complete gobbledigook
Why
Come back in July then, because it isn't at all
The people working at the reception desk at the museum that day were all old indeed
The other guy, although he spoke English, was also older
It didn't really damage my image of German people because it was just one stupid guy, but we ended up eating somewhere else :P what can I say, we joked that the heatwave had fried his brain a bit as well (if I remember correctly it was like around 40 °C, I don't think Berlin has the infrastructure for that so everybody was a bit annoyed)
I mean it may be because I had a lot of expectations for London and none for Birmingham, so my opinion may be biased
If you don't like cobblestone streets, I think you're kinda fucked anywhere you go
Except for really old villages, since that type of cobblestone started being used in the 16th century
Cobblestone roads aren't that common though
He didn't like becaus it was grey and depressing, let him burn mid July, I mean we have sun pretty much all year except November-February
In elementary school it's mostly taught the regional, Iberian, cultures so ancient cultures would be
Celts
Iberians
Celtiberians
Romans
and, of course, the Lusitanians who according to my book in elementary school pushed huge boulders at Roman soldiers
In 5th grade, you actually start having a "history" subject, although joint with georgraphy, they separate in 7th grade, and it's from there on that you are actually thaught other ancient cultures like (at least where I went to school)
The Greek citystates
The Egyptians
The Indus Valley Civilization
The Yellow River Civilization
(Don't remember if the ancient civilizaiton in the Americas is mentioned)
The Sumerians
From what I remember, the first two are taught in more detail whilst the latter is just discussed as the first civilization and the other are just represented as the standart "first civilizations of the world"
But I think that's about it, got my old school books somewhere if I wanted to make sure but I'm to afraid to go on a tomb raid
Didn't have history in my highschool course (it hurts so much) so, I theorize they learn ancient cultures in more detail (Assyrians, Babylonians, Hittites, Medians, Persians, etc)
Agá which in english woul be uh-gah
Having said that, H is mute in most circumstances in portuguese, except for nh | ɲ | ; lh | ʎ | and ch | ʃ |
In Portuguese, the letter is pronounced as "agá".
In most words it has no sound, but in conjunction with other letters it can have a sound (c, for example, like in English)
European speakers usually don't pronounce it, but brazilian speakers have a tendency to pronounce it as an "r".
We call the letter "agá". But in Portuguese, H has no pronunciation/sound on its own
"Hugo" (male name) for example, is read as if it was "ugo".
However, when combined with some consonants, it does modify the sound
Those combinations are "ch"  (like in "chá" which means "tea", the "ch" it's pronounced like the "sh" in English, as in "shell"), "nh" (like in "galinha", which means "chicken", and the "nh" is pronounced like the "Ñ" in Spanish) and also "lh" (like in "milho", which means "corn", the "lh" it's a bit similar to the "ll" in Spanish but not exactly the same I think)
I don't believe you can call it mute
"Ha" e "a" reads differently
No, not really
Fucking hell nordic countries, why is everything you do so forward
In Portuguese, we usually use made-up expressions
Harmless ways to put it:
* **"Para lá do sol posto"** = Beyond the sundown
* **"Em cascos de rolha"** = I can't even translate this properly, and I can't find a single source that explains it's proper meaning and origin
I'd be great if anyone else could try and explain it
Slightly crude:
* **"No cu de Judas"** = In Judas' ass
Incredibly crude:
* **"Santa Cona do Assobio"** = Holy Cunt of Whistling
It plays on how Portuguese name their towns and villages, which usually have religious-based names or just plain weird combinations of words
"no cu de judas" (in the ass of judas) or "no fim do mundo" (at the end of the world)
In Portuguese we use "it pó cu de Judas"  go to Judas ass is the meaning
we have "caralho a 4"
> Em cascos de rolha"
Cork caskets- such a rural and backwards  place that caskets are of cork wood
There's way more expressions:
- **Nos cornos da Lua** - upon the Horns of the moon
- **Nos cabos do Inferno** - On the capes of Hell
- **Onde o diabo/judas perdeu as botas** - wherever the devil/judas lost their boots
"**No caralho mais velho**" = In the oldest dick
Same here, though people always pronounce it Co**n**chichina instead of Cochi**n**china
I don't think most people even know it's a real place
Thank you
: )
I had never heard the first two expressions you list, are they regional
The last is indeed more common, I feel, I totally forgot about that one
Caralho doesn't have a perfect translation to English and also loses its power, you can also translate it to "in the oldest fuck" or "in the oldest balls"
Idk, I've heard them both on tv before, but they could be
>Caralho doesn't have a perfect translation
"Caralho" literally means "dick". It's just that more often than not it's used as an interjection, akin to the versatile way "fuck" is used in English, thus losing that literal meaning
>Edit: I'd also like to nominate this as "the weirdest or funniest thing a foreigner said".
Except /u/executivemonkey is the resident American troll (and a very funny one at that) from /r/europe and /r/AskEurope and has been for years
I'm always surprised people don't recognize his username by now
Yes it did, it was breaking news in every major tv channel and it was a discussion topic for about a week or so
It was all the rage here, it was heavily debate from the news TV channels to news outlets to even in my university in multiple classes between the the professors and students
The event hit home a little bit because Brazil is to us Portuguese like the USA is to the UK, there's a close bond
I heard a bit of it, but it was not massive news
Then there was the new zealand shooting and we were also starting to realize the consequences of Idai in Moçambique
Dunno
First time I hear of it
As bad as a school shooting is, makes sense the NZ shooting got more coverage worldwide
In general yh, the only thing we don't like about you guys are basically a general dislike of dubbing in Brazilian Portuguese on show like in anime in services like Netflix and crunchy roll (for some reason the Brazilian dub of anime and show doesn't match the voice of the characters), and fact that because you are so many, that people forget about Portuguese as a language and say we speak Brazilian in Portugal (it's not your guys fault xP)
Like we all like the former colonies but in general the Portuguese Brazil relationship both diplomatic and from a public opinion is extremely close
They still do
At least 45% of the time
Oof
I mean, we usually hate Brazilian dubs on movies, but not that much on anime
The DBZ brazilian dub is great, for example
Here in Portugal they are very stricted and somewhat stupid, first you can't get a gun that easy which I think it's good
If you have an intruder in your house and you want to defend yourself you can only hurt him like in the front so eg
You have a knife and you stab the guy in the stomach that could be considered self defense but if he had is back turn to you it wouldn't because it means he wasn't attacking you
But the most ridiculous thing is they will not arrest the guy unless they catch him in the act, we were robbed a couple years ago during the night and my brother was in the living room playing ps the guy walked in and my brother started to yell my father came running but the guy jumped out of the window then my brother went to the station to identify the guy he identified one but the police can't arrest him because they didn't see him there
My understanding from what my Krav Maga instructor once told me, in Portugal, the law surrounding self defense pretty much only allow for killing if the victim is in a position of absolutely no other choice and is exposed, like being in the bathroom and nowhere else is killing well justified
Outside, in the public space, there's some basic rules, by law, to sort of diffuse harmful contact as much as possible, say, not going straight to the face if violence is imminent but once it's on, it's on and basically short of killing the perpetrator, all contact is somewhat justified
Firearms are pretty much illegal unless it's a hunting rifle, blunt objects are regulated, so it better be the absolute mother of necessity to use them
Shitty, gives the impression that the intruder will almost allways profit from the situation
If anyone broke into my house and I beat the shit out of them I doubt that I wouldnt be in trouble
Yes
[Guarda Nacional Republicana (GNR)] is a military police that works in rural areas
Major cities are under the jurisdiction of [Policia de Segurança Pública (PSP)] which is non-military
A bit unrelated, but very interesting, is the case of Brazil, for two reasons
First  they have a military police that is called
"Military Police" (Polícia Militar), and each state has its own, and they operate in cities two, like in Rio de Janeiro, which brings me to my second point  of interest, which is the movie "Tropa de Elite", a must-see Brazilian movie about an elite branch of this police squad and the drug trade in the city
Its truly a great saga, and I recommend it to anyone
I don't think either of our police forces are military
While GNR is more common in rural areas, they also exist in the major cities
And vice-versa
PSP also acts in rural areas
I don't think so
Some differences might exist on paper, but on everyday life they are similar
The word "Sacana" comes from the Japanese "Sakana", meaning fish
In Portuguese means "sneaky bastard".
The story goes when the Portuguese arrived in Japan, the Japanese called us Sakana, because we came from the sea and had big eyes
The Portuguese thought it meant something else and started calling each other "Sacana".
Example: "Seu sacana de um raio": "You goddamn sneaky weasel".
One that comes to mind is the word *pergaminho*. It means *scroll* in Portuguese
One time during History class our lecturer was talking about the ancient Greek city of Pergamon (now situated in modern day Turkey) and how it was famous for its production of parchment, when all of a sudden I put two and two together in my brain and ask if that's where the word *pergaminho* comes from then
He said I was right and that I had made a good observation, which made me feel like a smartass for the rest of the day
We also have that one in Portuguese, but it's spelled oxalá.
So first in the formative years we learn about the predecessor of all things that would later influence the politics and future events, so we start normally with the Greeks then the Romans and the iberian tribes with the especially place for the lusitanos (the ancestors of the Portuguese), we also study the Phoenicians since they were here in iberia with the Greeks and later the Romans
Then actual history of the country first the political climate of the reconquista and how the country was formed (the history of our first King was really badass i recommend people reading it you will enjoy it) then the military exploits against other reconquista kingdoms and the moors kingdoms, the expansion, Portugal was the first to end its territorial expansion in 1200s having the oldest consistent boarders in Europe (and that's a big achievement considering European history), we also study about the British and their help during the reconquista and against the other kingdoms that then lead to the creation of oldest alliance in the world still active (Portugal and England alliance), then we study the dynasties in general sense and giving special attention to the most important monarchs and their achievements (a good way to remember was by their cognome which is basically a nickname given to the king or queen an their deeds for example D. Pedro the I had the cognome of the "o justiceiro" = the just (more like the punisher) tldr he loved a girl but the king and the Royals didn't like, they got her killed by buying killers, when he became king he brought the killers to justice made them kiss the hand of his dead lover corpse, and later they were executed, he also crown the corpse because she was his true love and so she deserved to be his queen), we also learn about important events that shape our history and global and European history like our sea adventures, colonialism, slavery, the Lisbon earthquake that literally changed European philosophy and architecture, we learn about the development of technology advancement in automation like the printing press and fabric we learn about the lousy deals that our monarch had with the British that destroyed our economy and industry for literally centuries, we also learn about the French revolution since it was the turning point of modern history, a bit about the American history, the French inventions and our success at beating them and defending our ground, then the events of the 19 and 20 centuries
We have to squeeze this all there's no real alternative either you learn it or not, now we don't study every war and its fine details just a general view on the matter and a few important events, also this is given in multiple years so its like you are studying this from the early grades until the 12 grade, so for example in the 12 grade you mainly study the event from 18th to 20th century with a bit of old information from previous years
Also other classes like Portuguese we study a bit of history through literature like the book lusíadas or the works from Pessoa and the context of his environment etc
To add before learning all this we are taught the history of evolutionary fases of men and its tribes and tools and stuff
Interesting reads
Pedro the first the just
The founding King of Portugal
Lisbon earthquake:
U can't fit 300 years
That's barely history m8
Very nicely put
Just add some paragraphs so it's easier on the eye n to read ofc
Yes, we learned that the hard way
In Portugal you finish high school/start university when you are 17/18
For example this year seniors/ uni freshman were born in 2003
In Portugal most people I know do this:
4 years of elementary school  usually starts when you are 6/5
With portuguese, math, PE, music, a subject which teaches about history, geography and the human body
2+3 years of midle school
Basicly the same subjects, plus history, geography, biology and geology, physics and chemistry and a 3rd language (usually french/spanish/german)
Then you either go to a vocacional school or regular high school
In high school you can choose 1 of 3 diferent "themes" according  to what you want to study in university: ciences, humanities or art
Normally high school ends when you are 18/17
Most who go to regular high school want to go to university
Same thing in Portugal
It's so weird calling them that tbh
We start at 6 and should finish 12 years later
At 18 you should be entering college
Ya they are just “alunos do 12°”
And freshmen are "caloiros" :)
In Portugal it is 4 years of elementary school, 5 years of middle school and 3 years of high school
In Portugal it had great coverage when the things were at it's peak
Usually it opened almost every news program, and had enormous coverage
Nowadays, due to COVID-19, BLM, national news and other recent events, it gets a bit overshadowed
There are some news here and there, but it definitely hasn't the same coverage it had
I feel like the portuguese population in general has a sense of sympathy towards the cause, mainly due to history, as resisting spanish attempts to rule Portugal is a big part of our history
I don't really share the sympathy thowords an independent Catalonia including most people I talk to but it's hard to say where the majority stands
I see it as an appeal to populist movements which cause more divide than justice to the people
History should had nothing to do with it
Our feud with Spain ended a long time ago and it's in the past, we should instead embrace our common history and heritage
In my opinion, the best would be a fair referendum
Letting the people decide
If the majority wants independence, then they should have it, but if the majority doesn't want independence, then Catalonia should remain part of Spain
Vila Nova de Gaia
Located in Portugal on the south side of the Douro river oposite to Oporto ( Second largest city in Portugal)
On this ground an ancient Celtic settlement  existed  called 'calle or galle'.
By the time the Romans came, it turned to Gale
On the north side of the river,  a port for the settlement  was buit know as ' portuscale' or Port of Cale
When the muslim invaded Iberia the river became the border and the settlement was abandoned
As Christians fled to the north side the Port became it's  own settlement,  know today as Oporto
But the Area retained  the name 'Portuscale '.
When the reconquista kick started the father of the first king of Portugal was given the duchy of Portucale and the settlement after the souther conquests of territory the area was settled  again, this time gale was now pronounced  gaia and the area was renamed Vila Nova de Gaia ( New Town of Gaia )
So my town was the name sake of my contry ! XD
No one really knows where Silves comes from
All that we know is that the place is inhabited since pre-historic times
The first registered name for the city comes from the phoenicians, who called it Cilpes or Cilbes
This name was also used by the romans and everyone else until the muslim invasions, when it became known as Xilb
When Portugal conquered the city, the name Silves became official
As you can see the name didn't change that much throughout history
The thing is, no one knows where it comes from to begin with
It is thought that the name Cilpes comes from the  Cilibitani or Cibilitani, as Pliny mentions the existence of a oppida stipendiaria with this name in nowadays Portugal
Avienus mentioned in his Ora Maritima a river named Cilbus, where the Cilbiceni lived
But once again, we only know these people lived in Lusitania, we don't know exactly where they were from
However, it is also thought that this name could have originated Quelfes, a town some 60 Km away from Silves
We also know that modern Silves was relocated
The original settlement was some two kilometres further down the river
However, despite knowing that the city existed during Roman times, it does not appear in any records of Ptolemy
Furthermore, the only indications that we have of the romans in the city are some bowls, a roman villa, some busts and a statue of Jupiter with some coins
We also know that Cilpis produced coins, as roman currency has been found with the name Cilpis
All in all, the name possibly comes from a tribe living there, but no one can say for sure where the city's name comes from
Agualva, a town in Lisbon, Portugal
The name was given after the quality of the little river that crosses it
The name is a conjunction of Agua (water) + Alva (clear or pure)
Edit: It dates back to even before our first king
Viseu (viso eu) I see in English
It comes from the fact that its located in a high place and Viriato the leader of a lusitanian tribe could see the Romans and fight them of
He was a real life Asterix because everywhere else was conquered but he fought them off until he was betrayed and assassinated
He is one of our national heros
I live near Horta, a city in the Azores which got its name from the first donatary captain of the island of Faial, where the city is now located, Joss van Hürter, a belgian settler
The portuguese language led to the "aportuguesation" of the name, leading to Horta
His surname also changed later from "van Hürter" to "de Utra" to "D'Utra" and finally "Dutra" which is my surname
Lisboa comes from Olissipo
Olissipo is the Phoenician word for safe harbor
This name Olissipo, is more than 3000 years old
The city is even older
Taking this thread as the Portugal thread:
"Coimbra" comes from "Conimbriga", which since the -briga suffix was used to refer to settlements and there was a tribe around called the "Conii", thus giving it the name
Dropping the "n" between vowels is a very common phenomenon in Portuguese linguistic history
Oddly enough, Conimbriga was a different closeby roman settlement a bit into the interior (of which the ruins are still there and very much a must-visit), whereas the current town of Coimbra is located in a hill by the Mondego river bank halfway between Lisbon and Porto, where walls were built and where most of the reconquista was headquartered from, was initially called Aeminium
It was a much smaller Roman outpost, but it still has some Roman sewers atop the hill
From what I read the Cale was in fact what is now Porto
More specifically the castro where now Porto's nucleus is, Sé.
The theory of Portus cale having to do with Gaia's castle doesn't have archeological and historical standing, even in celtic and late roman times the Cale is described as being on the edge of Callaecia
Seeing that the frontier with Lusitania was the Douro river it Cale is Porto
Hello fellow Portuguese, pls refrain from using Oporto, thanks bye and have a bom dia
Well i read that on Wikipedia  so I must be right
Ahahha
yeah, it's  quite possible you are right
Like i said, in my case its Wikipedia  knowledge
In Portuguese: *Ronrom*.
The verb *to purr* translates to *ronronar*.
"The cat is purring
" translates to «O gato está a ronronar
Purr for sound
Ronronar, verb
Eu acho que ele está a perguntar a onomatopeia, que seria *rrrrrr* certo
É _ronrom_, pelo menos fui ensinado na escola que era esse o termo
It depends on the subjects, but according to the rankings it's (with no specific order) Universidade do Porto, Universidade de Lisboa, Universidade de Coimbra, Universidade Nova de Lisboa
They're all public
Uhm, Ubi from covilha, the one in porto, Coimbra and Castelo branco have really nicest, but the hardest to join is Porto and Lisbon (Portugal btw)
Minho University
Universidade de Coimbra
Já não estamos na idade média
Ahhaahahaha
You sound pretty biased there
Literally never heard anything about IPCB and UBI is arguably still behind the big 4
Ah like, I'm don't know a lot of university's in Portugal, sorry if I'm wrong, just tried to answer I guess :/, the university that I know better it's Ubi cuz I live in Covilhã
Hard for any university to overtake ULisboa, Nova (central location in a country very dependent on Lisbon), Porto (same thing but in the north) and Coimbra (old and prestigious), to be honest
True, but Ubi in a gud spot tho, but lisboa, Porto and Coimbra are the bests
In our epic poem, the Lusiads, there are water nymphs in the Tagus River called the Tágides
And according to the poem, the reason the Cape of Storms was filled with storms was because of a Giant named [Adamastor] who was banished there after falling in love with Thetis, one of the nereids, heartbroken because of his unrequited love, now appearing out of a storm cloud and threatening to ruin anyone hardy enough to attempt passing the Cape and penetrate the Indian Ocean, which was Adamastor's domain
Adamastor became the spirit of the Cape of Storms, a hideous phantom of unearthly pallor
Vasco da Gama asks the beast who he is and after Adamastor tells him his life story, the Giant calms down and lets them through - thus the Cape of Storms is renamed Cape of Good Hope
Well not exactly, although from what i know our ancestors before the roman invasions had a strong nature base pantheon and myth, it was most lost with Time do to the aggressive roots of Christianity
In interior regions of Portugal there are some pagan  worshipping and pagan myths some what alive, some times the population doesn't really understand that they are doing pagan stuff or are aware that they are doing pagan rituals
to them they are just following tradition and aren't really aware of its roots
>People in South America and Africa tend to be more into their Christianity now than Europeans are yet folk beliefs are still pretty strong across those continents
I don't know that religiosity necessarily means discarding folklore
Here's the thing by the times Europeans started to colonisation of this places the approach was different, for example the ability to have written records were greatly available starting around the 15 century do to the pressing machines, we know that some priest that were in the colonies normally would take records of the conversions with natives and this includes myths and religious, we also that the colonisers only control the costal area and only around the 18 century that stated to advance the interior regions
This factors provided the ability to the native culture to survive
In opposition the conquest by the Romans and reconquista by the European forces of the Iberian peninsula cause it to suffer from 4 magor culture shifts that destroyed a lot of the natives culture, one was the roman faith, then early Christianity, Islam, medieval Christianity, there's also almost no records that describe the natives culture
the extreme views of medieval Christianity on paganism and the methods used to destroy or incorporate it into the religion were extremely cruel and destroyed a lot of culture, although the Christianity that reached the colonies was extreme it was also moderated in comparison to the early medieval Christianity
We are also less religious than them because we also had a stronger influence from the racional thinkers of Europe of 17 and 18 centuries
So there's a lot of factors that led to the destruction of our ancestors culture
>England experienced invasion and cultural disruption from Rome, the Anglo-Saxons, re-conversion to Christianity in the Dark Ages, and then the Protestant Reformation
And we still have folklore
but by that time the printing press was just invented, the events that happen in the peninsula was much more extreme than england, especialy  rome dominance, and older than before the printing press
> Which Britain and Germany (for example) went through, yet we still have plenty of folklore
i was refering to the differance in religion belife leves and not the folklore
> Which were present in other countries like Germany, which still has plenty of recorded folklore
you know that inquisition was always presente in the iberian regions and they censure anything that wasn't christian and that after the split of christianity in to catholic and Protestant the kingdoms that form germany stoped being censure by the church, while portugal and spain were censure culturaly by the inquisition untly around the 18th
Also we do have folklore, but not from our ancient ancestors, we have more recent folklore from recent history around 800 years ago like the baker woman of Aljubarrota, witches
There are a few, and i mean a few, remaining pagan and celtic traditions/rituals but only existe in remote areas and the people who perform it don't know their origins they only know it has a tradition
The bride leaving her groom at the altar after her love interest opposes the marriage and they run off together
I mean, they could do it (though we don't have the part where people are asked if they oppose the wedding), but there would be so much backlash later they would never be welcome in that town or their families again
You covered pretty much everything
Apparently in USA you can even change your surnames
I don't know anyone who has changed their names
It's a bit rude to ask directly, but I guess you can say something if you can't understand the other person, although I have rarely seen it (a teacher of mine said it to a student from Azores)
I will, in conversations with people who may have difficulties understanding me, soften my accent and make the pronounciation clearer (properly say "v" instead of turning them into "b", for example, or softening the "ão" sound)
> Friulano has plurals in s
The way it should be
Eh, my experience in Spain is that Spanish people don't give a fuck if you don't understand them :D
Italian just stands out compared to the major western romance languages as it doesn't form the plural in a s. Although French is a bit more complex (surprise
) than Portuguese or Spanish
It is not לדינו
Recycling bins colours

everyone can get to university getting a degree is something different
Wrapped in dough
I don't know
But if you want an equivalent for dumplings, maybe [Pastél de Bacalhau] It's pieces of boiled cod fish, with some herbs, involved in mash potato and then fried
Other than this, I don't think we have something more like a dumpling specific to us only
We eat Ravioli
EDIT: I'm sorry, I forgot about other (better) examples:
[Rissol] Typically filled with shrimp and sauce or meat
[Empada] Filled with chicken and some herbs
[Empanadilha] Filled with a sauce with tuna or chicken
We have the [rissol] and it’s the best thing ever
It can be filled with meat or shrimp or fish, and it’s deep fried afterward
We bring them to picnics, serve miniatures at birthday parties and are a common option for a quick lunch (usually every café has them)
Viva o rissol
Rissol, man
O meu pequeno almoço preferido é mais que qualificado para este post: [Pastel de Chaves]
I love them
In Portugal we can easily find tortellinis in supermarkets, they're delicious
Didn’t know that
Canja (Chicken soup) with pasta or with rice
I would say in Portugal either Sagres or Super Bock
And we all know the best is super bock tho

TIL some people make canja with rice
What kind of heathen taints Canja by putting rice in it
Southerners do
I know, it's strange
I heard they even throw pepermint leaves on it
I've had peppermint leaves on canja de galinha with pasta
It's honestly pretty good
Since I live in the "center" region my "canja" often varies between rice and pasta, somedays with pasta
somedays with rice
Strange
Rice is the only way to eat "Canja". Eating it with pasta brings our country back to the middle ages
That's not possible
You have to choose one side
You can't live in a grey area
When the "Canjada: Portuguese civil war" begins, you have to choose one of parties
Norway, I would love to roadtrip from south to north so bad
Italy for sure
It just seems like such a rich country in terms of history, culture, and cuisine
The language itself is also very aesthetic, and I really appreciate the abundance of different regional dialects
And it looks beautiful, both in terms of natural landscapes as well as in architecture
Of course I know there's more to the country than that
I try not to see things from rose-tinted glasses, but despite that the country looks super appealing to me
I had the chance to visit Venice and Rome, but I would love to do a tour of the whole country
The Netherlands for me
I love the language, I find the people extremely beautiful and attractive, I love how direct they are, I love the landscape and the animals that origin from there, I like the food I've tried from there, tulips are my favourite flower, etc etc
I have no relations to anything or anyone there, I'm just in love with it
The United States, it's just a result of all the movies and tv shows that we see that take place there
I feel the same
I generally quite like the weather here, but sometimes I really want to be somewhere that's green and somewhat "gloomy".
Now I'm reminded of [this] lmao
We may be small but there is a great variety in culture and landscapes, allow me to recommend you the north of the country for your next visit
In Norway I would like to go to Bergen and the Lofoten Islands at least
National one
I am portuguese
And usually when travelling Portuguese is seen as a friendly, non threatening, non filthy-rich nationality and hardly anybody has a grudge against Portugal except Brazil and maybe North Korea
PELA (contraction of por+a) glória da união, fyi
It's understable, because para can also be translated as for, but in this case it meant to or towards
We don't have that song
But if we had it would go like this:
**Cabeça**, **Ombros**, **Joelhos** e **Dedos dos Pés** (x2)
E **Olhos** e **Orelhas** e **Boca** e **Nariz**
Cabeça, Ombros, Joelhos e Dedos dos Pés
We have it
If you search it on YouTube i think you can find the portuguese version sang by "Canal Panda"
[here it is]
Lol, awesome
So it's not toes but "feet".
Probably Salazar
He was like the portuguese Mussolini
> It's played in turns like rock paper scissors
Rock Paper Scissors is not played in turns, mate
We are lazy and prefer to sun bath because our parents pay us the bills until we're in our 30s.
Honestly, we don't have a lot of industries moving in and people creating decent well paying jobs
Lots of corruption as well which makes taxes go higher to be able to sustain public services and pay for the corruption and inefficient political decisions
Companies not paying enough for people to go to work and pay their bills (due to taxation, going to work barely makes any cash for you to pay your expenses of going to work and keep yourself fed for a month)
Nepotism, a lot of it
No advantages to actually work, if you do work you'll get incredibly taxed even if it's minimum wage, so people just work "under the table" or don't work at all and become immigrants
If you work a lot, depending on the company, you might be fired because you've finished your job way before the time the company was expecting it so you need to keep it going
There's a list of other issues, but from what I'm seeing on this thread, other people from the south seem to have pointed them out as well
To sum up: We're poor but we are beatiful and have sun
I agreed with everything except yout attack on independentists
It's your fault they exist
You handled them with arrogance because you promised to give them more autonomy and then never did so obviously they got upset
Also if you hadn't suppress their election with police force and arrested their leaders like they are some sort of criminals probably the issue would have been contained
I wasn't very favourable of the Catalunha cause until I saw you send armed police officers beat on unarmed innocent citizens who just wanted to vote
That turned me in favor of their cause
The only thing I don't understand is why they are still not like  basques and started bombing Spain after the humiliations they endured
They sure are a peaceful patient people
Minimum wage gets 11% taxes
The taxes become higher because of our progressive IRS taxing system
If big companies companies paid their fair share of taxes workers wouldn't have to pay as much
Go away Iniciativa Liberal guy
no dude
all the Mediterranean countries count, and portugal
Yes some of us go abroad to get better jobs
Others prefer to stay and suffer because our country is fucking amazing (asides from job conditions)
I consider going abroad but i hope I am not forced to stay more than 2-3 yrs away from my country
The ideal would be to get a remote job
I would like to travel a lot and know different realities but one thing is travelling and being able to come back whenever you get tired, other thing is being forced to live in a country with no sun
️ At least they have blondies in those countries and i like blondies and gingers
Lol
Thank you french person
I love your frontality
I am not a very patient person
If you know the law and know how to complain things get done
I don't like the inneficiency of public services (also private companies are inneficient as well sometimes) but it has been improving
I guess it is a price you pay for being able to have so much sun in a nice peaceful country
About languishing my life away, job wise I do get what you mean, that's why I intend to go abroad
But I think I will always come back to my country and if I buy a house it will be here not elsewhere
I never used any drugs
I have wiser ways to spend my money
And you think 11% on a wage below 800 is ok for alright, fair enough
The problem isent companies, you have small companies opening in Spain and working here because you get less taxation in some cases, charging even more doesn't make them come back
But, suit yourself
So the problem is the existence of countries who do fiscal dumping
With a unified european fiscal policy that wouldn't happen
"Brazil's educational system is the Portuguese fault

you forgot about the southern countries “also have duties and can’t spend their money on women and alcohol and then ask for help
” - Jeroen Dijsselbloem
Oh yeah, I forgot that little gem
I believe that a foreigner should vote for election's that directly involves him
For example in Portugal a foreign (independent of is country of origin) should be able to vote except for the president
A president in our Constitution has a representative role and not so much a politic role so he's there to represent the Portuguese people with born or acquired nationality
So he should be able to vote in general elections for the parliament
Yes, in here some foreign residents can vote, they must be registered to vote and belong to one of these countries: Brazil, Cape Verde, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Iceland, Norway,  New Zealand, Peru, Uruguay, Venezuela and, of course, all EU countries
Edit: sorry, that applies only to local elections, for the general and presidential ones, they aren’t allowed to vote, except Brazilians with residence in our country
If they are residents and Not from the USA why not
Has many people already pointed, it is unfair that a person (from the EU) living in a foreign country for decades cannot make their voice heard in the democratic process, while someone who's a national and had barely set foot in their home country, can
Some people are mentioning conscription as well
I think the only major requisite for obtaining voting rights is being fluent in the language of the country
People, national born or not, should make a language, history and political system test before being able to vote
If you're from another EU country and have been living in Portugal for several years, and pass this theoretical test, you should be able to vote, citizenship or not
Being born in a country should not automatically give you a special status nor should it bind you
If you love a country, its language, people and culture, then you're a citizen already
The rest is beaurocracy
A national of your country that lives and work in another country Vs a foreign that lives and work in your country
who do you think that have more commitment to your country
If you're a legit tax payer why should you be descriminated and have less rights than a person that don't pay taxes in your country
"De Espanha nem bom vento nem bom casamento "
From Spain no good wind nor a good marriage (nothing good comes from Spain)
"vai marrar com o comboio de chelas"
Go complain with the chelas train ( basically go waste some else's time)
"para mim é grego"
It's Greek to me (i don't understand that)
"um bicho de sete cabeças"
Seven headed beast/animal (something complicated, or difficult to understand or do)
"Deves ser espanhol a ver"
You must be a Spaniard when it comes to seeing (basically when someone is touching everything and anything way to much)
"Resvés campo de Ourique "
Almost hit campo de Ourique (it's an expression that comes from 1755 from the time of great Lisbon earthquake/fire/tsunami, a great portion of the city got completely obliterated and destruction just barely miss campo de Ourique
So it's basically a way of saying it was closed call)
I can sort of get by in Spain, but only by speaking a mixture of Portuguese and Spanish
I can understand around 70% when reading Spanish, but having a conversation is harder
Galicia is the easiest region for us Portuguese speakers, due to how closely related our languages are
When I went to Rome a few years ago I thought I wouldn't need to resort to English, but I grossly overestimated my communication skills
In my experience, it's tremendously easy to travel in spain, without using any english
Spanish is closest to Portuguese but I only got by in Galicia, with Spaniards from Madrid I was asked to speak in English
There's a big sign saying "Welcome to Spain" and under it someone scribbled "Galiza is not Spain" (I've only crossed it in the north) and that's it
[Completely painless] just like any other road
There are two nearby points where I can cross "officially" into Spain, both of them without any type of control whatsoever
You just go by a sign and puff, you're in Spain
Additionally, outside of the rainy season, when the small rivers and streams run again and can be difficult (or even impossible) to pass, there's plenty of points accessible by dirt roads where I could just drive (or even walk) into Spain without anyone even noticing (in fact, some of these points were used for contraband routes, during the dictatorship)
It's pretty painless, but there's this huge orange filter that overlays the landscape all of a sudden
Weird
I wouldn't notice any difference if it wasn't for the 'España' sign on the right side of the highway
It's a loooooong story
What is your wallpaper image (desktop, tablet, smartphone)
Just curious to know what people have as their wallpaper image
I'm mostly asking about what wallpaper you have on your computer, but tablet and smartphone wallpapers are also welcome
My current wallpaper is a [screenshot of a scene] from Studio Ghibli's [Porco Rosso] A lot of scenes in Ghibli films make for great wallpapers, but I chose this one in particular because it reminded of some old traditional cafés you can still find in some parts of Portugal, though the movie itself mostly takes place in Istria (between WWI and WWII iirc)
There's actually [another scene] I nearly chose to use as a wallpaper image, one that reminds me of some the beaches over here, but in the end I went with the former
Anime shit in all of them
I don't think I should share that, to be honest
I really like the laptop one as a wallpaper
Yeah I still have the default wallpaper on my Galaxy S8
When I first got it I tried a lot of different pics but didn't like any of them as a wallpaper and so I just left it as is
Been like that for 2 years now haha
Love the atmosphere of that painting
That train picture is amazing
Kamurocho <3
Princess Mononoke might be my favourite out of all the Ghibli films
I'm surprised I never knew about Erté before
Love his style
I've yet to watch Pom Poko
A few years back I decided to watch Kiki's Delivery Service one Christmas, and ever since then I've watched a Ghibli movie every Christmas
Last Christmas I watched Only Yesterday for the first time
I also have a theatrical poster of The Wind Rises framed on my wall, which I managed to get from the local cine-theatre a few years back
[This one] but in Portuguese and without the obnoxious logos at the top
It also says "Academy Award winner Hayao Miyazaki's final masterpiece" lmao
Wish that spa existed irl
"My name is Yoshikage Kira
I'm 33 years old
My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married
I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest
I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink
I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what
After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning
Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning
I was told there were no issues at my last check-up
I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life
I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night
That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness
Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone
I love Kira
Definitely my favourite JoJo villain
Hmmm
I'm going to guess command seals from Fate Stay/Night
That or something from the game Pathologic (or its sequel Pathologic 2)
Can't beat Ghibli food
The latter reminds me of Made in Abyss
With or without the watermarks
I really enjoyed the show and can't wait for the second season
Haven't watched the movie (the one taking place after the first season) yet
Absolutely loved the show, but it was very tough to watch at times

Seasonal jokes about the Portuguese immigrants in France
About how they dress, how they have weird stickers and stuff on the car, how stubborn they are about speaking in Portuguese when they can't speak it anymore
England, France and Spain, as in "An English, a French and Spaniard walk into a bar
" sort of jokes
Also North Americans and Brazilians, though those are rare nowadays
A Portuguese a Frenchman and a Brit enter a bar
We have some jokes on France and England
All of them start like this: Um português, um inglês e um francês (...)
There are also many jokes regarding Spain (of course)
I think France
Maybe (._. )
France and Spain mostly
Lots of jokes about ourselves, and about spain and france
It's alright
We have plenty of jokes about you guys too
and Spanish people don't forget the classics
[O EMIGRANTE] (I'd like some French reactions to this)
Always saw the French ones as the classics
People in Portugal never liked much the Spanish but I always heard more jokes about the avecs than anything else
I know one, but it might be a bit offensive:
In China were a Portuguese, an American and a Spaniard
They were having a drink in the main square, but they didn't know that in China this is forbidden and so they were caught in the act and arrested
The next day they were sent to the jailer to receive their sentence
The jailer told them that they would receive 30 lashes as punishment
Except, as China was in transition between the year of the dog and the year of the rat, so each prisoner would be entitled to one request, he says:
\- You American
What is your wish, provided it is not to escape punishment
The American answers:
\- I want a pillow tied to my back
\- So be it
And take the lashes with the pillow on your back
- Says the Chinese
By the fifteenth lash, the pillow gave way and the American took 15 lashes
Turning to Spaniard, he says:
\- It's your turn, Spaniard
What is your wish
The Spaniard answers:
\- Tie two pillows on my back
And so it was
By the twenty-fifth whipping, the pillows gave way and the Spaniard caught five of the 30 lashes
But he was happy because he outsmarted the American
It was the Portuguese's turn
Says the Chinese:
\- Well, well, you're Portuguese
Let's get this over with, what is your wish
And says the Portuguese:
\- Tie the Spaniard on my back
Haha xD
No heating in my house, because, you know, this is sunny Portugal and apparently people think it's normal to freeze in apartments during winter
Also, my apartment has low sun exposure and is set on a last floor
So, right now, we have a whopping 16 degrees Celsius and I am freezing to death
And yes, I have thermal underwear, also a merino jumper and a thick wool jacket and socks
But warming up is very tough for me, due to a medical condition, so here I am, frozen
And two hours ago the temp was at 15, so
Probably around 20C, probably less right now because I had the windows open a few minutes ago to air the room
I wear a sweater inside
I would say my house is slightly warmer than outside, like 14-15ºC, because we don't use heating inside
I guess is not a common practice here in Portugal given that we have 3-4 months of cold weather (around 10ºC)
For example, I had a polish exchange student in my classroom at university complaining about how cold ir was inside the room
Even in public spaces with heating the temperature normally isn't above 17-18ºC.
15C. It's way too cold but I guess it's normal around here
Heating is a luxury
This is one the portuguese issues that put us like a 3 world country, saldly
If the energy prices were adjusted to the purchase power, we wouldn't have this issue but yeah we have one of the most overpriced energy prices in Europe
It's surprising to me that in Northern Europe you have your houses so hot (23º)
But also have seen people from Northern Europe saying that 26-27º outside is really hot
That's so weird and I can't understand
In Portugal no one has a house that hot,16,5-20 should be the most common
Same
I can feel the pain
My experience is new construction is super efficient to react to lessons learned from inefficiency of older stock
For example many places we looked at were called ‘gemini-ed’, two houses with a common wall; lots of insulation; solar water heated systems
All places for sale seem to get energy rated, maybe it’s a rule (?)
Physicist spotted
Yeah I have no heating at home so it gets quite cold in winter
>In Portugal no one has a house that hot,16,5-20 should be the most common
&#x200B;
Look at the rich guy
Yes, it is known
Everybody from colder climates that arrive here in winter say the same thing
AC is also considered a luxury
To my Portuguese brain, I don't even know how you Canadian survive your winters, I personally have never experienced negative Celsius (I guess once I got to - 1) and, well, let's just say that that day wasn't a good day for me
TIL (and I kind of want one now)
I'm glad you are an optimistic person, unlike me
Things have improved, and yes, there is an energy rating that is required to sell houses
However, my cynical person thinks that constructors will cheat as much as they can
Oh the stories I have heard
I have a friend that is a civil engineer, and really, there are things that he told me that I wish I didn't know
We do have electric heaters, however, most people hardly use them, because our electric bills go through the roof
I think that at this point people are just so used to the cold, that they get home, and dress to stay in house, thick coat or robe, pijamas, a throw when you are on your coach
Showering: you just take a really hot shower and then when you finish reluctantly turn the tap off and dry yourself as fast as you can, and that's it (mind you that our winters aren't that cold, 10 degrees Celsius is considered very cold, around here)
Let me tell you, if drying fast could be a sport, we would be world champions
(I do own an electric heater on the bathroom, and it has saved my frozen life
There are stricter regulations than 50 years ago, but construction companies will try to circumvent those as much as possible, so in the end new buildings will still have crap insulation and mold issues
lol I was going to say 14-18 but the other Portuguese comment said 20, and I was like OK maybe people have house a lot hotter than I thought
Right now it's 16 in my room
That's exactly what happens here
If it gets colder just put another blanket and put up with it
No heating and isolation sucks
Yeah, even new house and flats don't have great isolation and old house are terrible for the most part
We are far behind most European countries
Summers without AC are tough, especially when 30 is considered a normal summer day
Well, 35 is a normal summer day,around here
Of course, it depends on where you live precisely in Portugal
Up north is colder
But let me tell you, 15 degrees in a home
Not comfortable
It's mild for the vast majority of the territory and the year, the logic here is that we have good weather so we don't need heating, truth is that when people from Nordic countries come here in the winter, they say they have never been colder indoors
I think new buildings are much more isolated tho
But many people live in older houses
yeah, it's 11 outside and no more than 15 In my house
I am changing windows soon but that's only part of the problem
This ️ I don't live in Portugal now but I was always freezing indoors even though the temperature wasn't that cold
Now I live in the UK and having heating and better insulation makes all the difference
Winter is must easier to deal with now
We don't really do that here
If anything we'd rather adopt a English loanwords instead
Pretty much
At most, we might adapt said loan word and apply Portuguese grammar/ortographic rules to it, namely when we need to use it as verbs ("postar", "tweetar", etc)
As always, direct translation in Portuguese: "vergonha alheia".
...that has been around since forever
And it has an equivalent in every language
Town of 150
Completely safe, on summer I'll walk the dog at 1am and I won't even see a single car
Lived in Lisbon for 6 years
I would go out for drinks with my friends and come back home at 4am with absolutely no problem
It was a 30 minute walk and I am a woman
Always felt extremely safe in Lisbon
Lisboa-I'm a womanand several times walk after work, around 23h/24h in the middle of the city never felt insecure
Portugal is a safe place
I live in Lisboa
I'm female, 54
I feel uneasy outside at night but, in all the years living in Lisboa, no stranger ever attacked me, except for some catcalling
yeah with 150 people even during the day it would be difficult to find anyone ;)
I actually found Edinburgh to be super safe at night
I'd walk most of the time and never felt particularly vulnerable, although the meadows did look a bit dodgy at times
Does your country have a "national" musical instrument
I put national in quotes because it doesn't necessarily need to be formally taken as "the national instrument". Maybe it's just an instrument that's deeply associated with a quintessential music genre from your country
If so, do you like how it sounds
What kind of music uses it
Care to share a nice song
For example, for Portugal it's the [Portuguese Guitar] If you ever been to Portugal, chances are you heard this sound, it's very omnipresent
Together with the vocals and the classic guitar, it forms the essence of our national music genre  [Fado]
I like the sound of the guitar, but I don't really like Fado
> I like the sound of the guitar, but I don't really like Fado
If it's the singing that puts you off, you can always check out Carlos Paredes (especially because he composed the piece you posted)
It's Coimbra fado, not Lisbon fado, and it's not sung, so it's less melodramatic, I find
Not just the portuguese guitar, I would argue the cavaquinho is also our national music instrument
And influential to other instruments elsewhere
An example
I am not sure if someone already made this comment, but we also have the [cavaquinho]
That one in the picture
It's a Portuguese guitar
There's a kind of pipe up north, it looks like a Scottish pipe
This actually sounds quite awesome
Now I get the Guinness symbol :)
Well, yes
When I hear accordion I usually think Amelie and crunchy, hot baguette
But accordion is actually Romanian, right
Isn't the band Wardruna from Norway
They made the soundtrack for the series Vikings
I think they sing old poems and such
They also use traditional instruments, no
They are the most awesome folk band I know
The Langspil sounds right for Iceland
I can feel the cold and the Viking through the sound of that thing
Yeah, I know Carlos Paredes
Only shared this video of a cover because the guitar is playing solo
I actually like Coimbra Fado
Saw it live once in Coimbra, one summer night
The students were playing on the streets
It was really awesome
Fado corrido is also great, because I usually burst laughing until my body hurts
When I think of German music, I think of big orchestras, and operas
I would never think of the accordion
Maybe it just be a matter of perception, but you seem to have your own signature of classic music
I know
My dad has one, and I've been trying to play it ever since I was a child
Never could
My dad can though
it's also on their Euro coins
Probably November 1st, 1755
All saints day, a holiday, there was a major earthquake far away in the Gorringe bank, where the european and north african plates crash, so earthquake, tsunami and a fire broke out and destroyed a lot of the city
For the memory the city at least that was the most relevant in recent-ish times, for relevance I think we had some revolutions and stuff around so maybe the 1974 revolution or the 1910 implantation of the republic (a lot of major stuff happens in or quite close to Terreiro do Paço or Rua do Arsenal)
It was in my city that the borders in continental Portugal finally came to be, in 1249, with the conquest of the city of Faro, and the moorish Kingdom of the Algarve, by portuguese king Afonso III
My region (the Algarve) was a de jure separate kingdom up until 1910, and a lot of our cultural traits can still be traced back to moroccan/moorish culture, as we were under their influence for a lot longer than the rest of the country
I have read a official Portuguese translation of Mein Kampf in the early 2000's. This doesn't seem very accurate
Constipation - Constipação (In English it means the opposite of a diarrhea but in portuguese it's just a flu)
Parentes - Parentes (In English it means mom and dad, but in portuguese it works for your whole family, the same as relative)
What you are saying is what we call "False Friends"
Pushar means Pull, and since Pushar is so close to Push doors are hard for me to understand
Not exactly an English word per se, but there's that relatively new car model named Kona, which in Portuguese (just change the k for a c) is slang for
lady bits
They had to change the name here to Kauai
Imagine my reaction when I saw the ad in English
"Puxe" sounds exactly like "push" but means "pull"
I've actually got into a cringey situation because of this
A little after the song "Ordinary Love" appeared, I searched what "Ordinary" meant
It meant "something normal". But what I didn't search, was the translation, and boy I should've
Because in Portuguese, ordinário, a rather similar word, means perv
So you can imagine the look on my friend when I told them I was a perv in the subway
We also use smoking
With makes no sense since it does not sound like a Portuguese word
The word "ordinário" can have the same meaning as the English word in Portuguese
You can use that word to refer to something that is usual
This word is the opposite of "extraordinário" (extraordinary in English), which means something unusual, uncommon
Most people use the word "ordinário" with the meaning of perv tho
Ohhhhhhhhhhhjhhh thank you
It's funny until a friend of mine, who bought a pack of mint scent Kleenex, scared an Erasmus student to death when he said that was the best for his constipation  still laugh until this day
The look on her face was incredible
I'm a Brit living in Portugal
I've been here a few years now and although I am conversational my grasp on the language is shaky at times and there's a lot of words I don't know
A lot of the time you can make an educated guess and get the right answer but sometimes that leads you astray
Not so long ago I was in the village cafe, as you do, to have a cafe
I was talking to one of the local lasses and when I asked her how she was (*tudo bem
*) she told me she had constipation
I was taken aback that she would share that with me and was lost for words
She just shrugged and walked off like it was nothing
I was so horrified I went straight home after my coffee and told my wife
We both had a good chuckle
Now it all makes sense
Edit: PS: Consumption was called consumption because of the weight loss associated with the disease
Tuberculosis literally consumed your body until you died
Respect
That's all you need
Have some social awareness
Look around and understand the environment
Europe is very diverse and you can find yourself in all kinds of situations
As long as you are open minded and respectful you won't annoy anyone
I understand European cities are cool and have a lot of history and things to see, but please don't occupy the whole sidewalk
Some of us have to get to work and it sucks already that we have narrow sidewalks
Have some self-awareness in cities please
Yes
Thank you, really
So many people dont understand that when visiting Portugal and think they are doing me a favour
They do ofc, but i mean, ive seen people act like they are the saviours of the country
Not against any tourist and we treat them well here, but dont act like your specific presence there is gonna do wonders for my country's economy
We are not that bad
She prefers sweet popcorn
I mean, I'm brazilian and I would definitely go crazy at them if they did it to me
Comi e queria não ter comido
I wouldn't say "hate" per se, but more like how, for a lot of non-Europeans, by "Europe" they only mean England/Germany/France/Italy/Amsterdam and think that what applies in those places applies everywhere else in the Old Continent
What do you mean by "Europeans don't use ice" and "You have to pay to pee all over Europe"?
That we're an homogenous bunch of white snobs
Sometimes you're overlooked even though you're at the very tip of western Europe
Neither do I. By that logic I'd think Americans are huge perverts and degenerates because of their porn industry, shows like Sex in the City and their scantily clothed female pop singers and rappers
I think that stereotype comes from France, i remember watching a documentary on the history Channel (during the morning) a few years ago an saw something about France at one point in history( sec
XIX XX id remember) being the capital of sex (parades, the upper-classes having parter switching has a common practice etc
Has a law student that stereotype annoys me a lot because it false, since a most (if not all) European countries that have a constitucion, have an article giving that right
For some people "European" is exclusively pale white people, apparentely Southern Europe doesn't exist/isn't white
I've only seen like two pay toilets in Portugal
Saw one last year when I went to Madeira which kinda took me aback
I mostly saw pay toilets in Germany, Switzerland and the Benelux countries
To be fair though, China's constitution claims to protect human rights so
I don't understand why American media finds gun violence OK but nudity a no-no
It's like they think that nudity = porn
Or you can just enter a café and ask for a glass of water
At least that's free here in Portugal
In the science of law there's a difference between a mere legality constituion from a State of legality and a true constitucion from a State of rule of law
The constitucion from the state of legality is not a true constitucion, it appears to be a normal constitucion but when you analyse its mechanics you compreende that it doesn't function like a constitucion (this the case with China and North Korea), for example if you read the Portugues constitution from 1933 you will see from a glance that the fundemental rights look almost the same has the current constitucion (1976) however if you look close enough to the 1933 constitucion you understand quickly that something is wrong because the constituion uses ambiguous terms that premite the state to have no limitations to restricte the rights of the citizens
In contrast a true constitucion from a State of rule of law limits the power of action of the state and gives a protection to the citizens that the state cannot break, (example :our current constitucion of 1976, and every other written constitucion of the EU members states and most if not all of the non EU members states that exist in Europe)
Edit i hope this explains, if you have a doubt or questions, i will try to answer it
Edit 2:
TLDR the Chinese constitucion is not a true constitucion because of technical reasons
The European countries constitucions are true constitucions because of technical reasons
But to everyone they're 4 eastern European member states
My cousins live in Sedan, their parents never taught them Portuguese, they pretend to be full blooded French, as if they're ashamed of their origins
When they visited, they never tried to get to know their family, instead they complained about everything, boasted how everything was so much better in France and ran off to the beach
After a while they stopped coming at all
To us, the younger cousins, we didn't care, we thought they were snobs, but it broke my grandmother's heart
Sure but that doesn't matter to how the country has historical and geopolitical baggage with the former USSR than West Germany
I understand that it must have been dificult for them
I heard from my aunt that they were bullied at school and we knew that their parents brought them to Portugal every summer against their will
They didn't feel connected to us or the country
Probably what they were bullied at home played a part in that
In the end, they didn't want to be part of our family and we all went our separate ways
They don't but they heavily matter even today
Why is that
Is it the way we look
How we talk
Do we behave strangely according to the French
I know however the past doesn't stop existing and there's plenty of baggage from the Communist era today
Of course there is
That's why Greece is grouped with Southern Europe (Italy, Spain and Portugal) than with the rest of the Balkans
Even though Portugal is the westermost country in Europe we don't have a complex about being "southern" or not being grouped with wealthy "western Europe".
In Portugal in not so big cities, You could buy a 200m2 house with 4 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms, pool, garden, garage
A really good house for you, sons and maybe grandsons
This is second house, but if you buy the land you probably can have something better, IMO pools are overrated in Portugal where 50% of the country is bathed by sea, which would make you have more space for divisions
You could easily buy a huge farm house with that money here, just a quick search and one of the first I got
86046,94 m2 of field and a house of 203,06 m2 with 3 rooms, but easily you could find better ones and there's loads that aren't even on the internet
In Portugal the tourist trap would be the Algarve
But I'm from the Algarve, so I'm going to tell you what to see there while avoiding the most touristic places
Avoid the main touristic areas
Albufeira, Vilamoura, Monte Gordo, Armação de Pêra and Portimão are cool if you wanna go to crowded beaches, drink booze until you fall over and feel like you are in England but with a hot climate
Any other place would be better to go to the beach
Eat local foods
Why would go to a McDonald's when you are in an entirely different country, with a different culture and food
Visit less known towns
In Silves, for example, the entire town is almost a museum
Castle, cathedral, churches, archeology and history are a must
The area around Sagres and the Vicentina coast are also a must
That area is full of castles and small fortifications to explore and discover, as well as gorgeous nature, small typical villages and the best spot to see the sunset
In Lagos, don't go only to the beach and bars
The city is super historical and there are churches and museums to visit
Same goes to Tavira, Faro and Olhão.
If you like nature or to visit small traditional villages, Monchique, Aljezur, Loulé and inland Tavira are perfect for you
The eastern part of the Algarve is also full of history, specially on the towns on the banks of the Guadiana River
Vila Real de Santo António, Castro Marim and Alcoutim are amazing
Faro also has a fantastic historical center, with the cathedral being the main monument
Scattered throughout the Algarve there are neolithic and classical monuments
In Silves there's the Menhir Route
Near Portimão you have the Necropolis of Alcalar
In Luz (near Lagos) there are Roman Ruins
There's also Roman Ruins in Estói (Estói also has an amazing XIX century palace)
I could keep going with Roman Ruins and neolithic monuments
All in all, the Algarve is an amazing place to discover and explore, with stunning nature, history and local culture
That last one happened to a friend on mine in krakow
He lost more than 1000€ and we were all very concerned because he didn't remember anything and he was alone
Pretty scary in ny opinion and to make things worse we were kn erasmus and didn't speak polish
When I was on Erasmus we had a whole presentation on how to spot an official taxi so we wouldn't be ripped off
Even then, their "night" prices were terrible, and they would still try to rip people off by saying they didn't have change and the money could be a tip
Uber was a godsend
My flatmate was robbed at the strip club exactly the same way you've described
He only remembers being told his payment didn't go through and they had to do it again

Nah, we are everywhere, we just write in English, unless for maybe subs about our own countries
There is no such thing as an automatic translation
This is the dumbest thing I've seen all year
English
Besides Portuguese subs, I'll write everything in English
And even in portuguese subs like r/portugal sometimes a tourist f.e. posts in english so "the hidden rule" we kinda use is answer in english to help (I mean, it would be rude not to, right
There is an extension of Google Translate to avoid that
Eh, I'd say part of why English is "easy" is because we're heavily exposed to it, learn it from a young age and have closer languages to it
Wouldn't be so easy for, say, a Chinese person to learn it
Yet English phonology is complex considering it's very inconsistent and doesn't have diacritics
Every language has a "hard" part
English is one of the easier languages to learn, but it doesn't come without its hurdles either
Don't forget /r/worldnews , which should be renamed to US foreign affairs news
It's rare to not see a post with Trump in the title there
Same in Portugal
You have "ground floor" (rés-do-chão) and then "first floor" (primeiro andar)
It depends on the noun:

primeiro **andar** \--- segundo **piso** \---
segundo **andar** \--- terceiro **piso** \---

Scotland: The television
The history behind the invention of the television is complex, but Alexander Bain introduced the facsimile machine in 1843 to 1846, and in 1926 John Logie Baird was the first person in the world to demonstrate a working television system

There is a village (aldeia) in my region that's literally called village (Aldeia)
No other distinguishing words, just «Aldeia».
Often referred as aldeia Aldeia «the village of Village».
I also believe there's a town on the border that is called border (fronteira)
Portugal has the Madeira island, Madeira means Wood
what do you think it has in abundance
(Clue: it wasn't a bird called Açor, leave that to the Azores )
and the Portuguese name for it is just new land which just as exciting
I wouldn't count that as boring, obvious or bland, though
What's obvious about Amadora being amateur
It's not like it's an amateur city, that's not why it was named Amadora

Hi pal, I am still proud to be European
This unity made travel around europe a lot less pain in the arse, more freedom in the market, free good exchange
A comon coin in most of the countries
A lot of development pushed forward, talking about my areas: we have EASA, EUROCAE, EUROCONTROL, Airbus itself, (ESA) which pushed europe as a whole to the top of the tops of the aviation industry
For example, people don't have a clue about how cool and advance our air traffic management system is, it can almost automatically coordinate flight departures based on the current weather and forcast, you can get an aircraft to get you of a stand at 11:50 and have on arrive at the same stand at 11:55 without any delay
EUROCONTROL every year sets new goals about hardware and software implementations and those goals are ALWAYS and I say again, always met
EUROCAE gives us the best and most reliable software certifications so passangers can travel safe
EASA push the most strict safety measures and rules of any other country out there
We are great and we work great as an union
You can find it maybe at American Pizzerias like Pizza Hut
But we don't eat pizza that much in Portugal comparing to other european countries so I'm not sure
Not a thing, and have some pity on the italians
Pros: fantastic weather, best food in Europe (you know its true, don't even try
/s), cheap alcohol (be it beer or wine), history, more or less more than stable political discourse in general (especially compared to other European nations)
One of the best roads in Europe
A very active night lifestyle

Cons: low wages, public transport is expensive especially considering that other countries with much higher cost of living and higher wages have a better service for much less, assholes drivers that think they are on a rally race track and basically are dick heads in general
Housing is impossible thanks to tourists, speaking of tourists because of the influx of people certain things got worse like overcrowding of certain areas and services, scammers in certain parts of the city claiming to "sell drugs" (spices) in a very annoying way
A bit expensive to drive in certain roads do to via verde
It’s basically the same for us
>politics are a joke, racism and blind nationalism
Oh no
Indeed
We have two: “abortadeira” and “desmanchadeira” – this last one comes from “desmancho”, which means to dismantle, undoing or cutting up
Edit: there’s a third and more obscure one, but I cannot remember it
We called it " Parteira" which is the exact same name given to a specialist nurse who does deliveries of babies
In some places they were named "comadres", which is the name given to the relationship between your mother and your partners mother ( co-mother)
Here posh families also used that expression
[Yma O Hyd] is pretty badass

The Soviet anthem, is one of the most powerful songs I ever heard
[La Strasbourgeoise] and [Le Chant des Partisans]
I'm might be killed or even worse, prohibited from eating chouriço ever again, but I like the french national anthem
Sorry fellow caralhos
Because you have a lot of cool Marschmusik
That's the reason why the song was originally made, in that exact year,  and one of the reasons that made us eventually turn into a republic, as our king hurt our nacional pride by conceding so easily, making a lot of people resent him for it
1755, All saints day earthquake in Lisbon
Besides the thousands of deaths, either by crushing, fire or drowning due to the tsunami that followed,  this earthquake made quite a hit among the way faith was regarded in Europe, raising questions on how could god punish one of the most Catholic country in Europe on one of Catholicism holiest days
The 1755 Earthquake, occurred on November 1, 1755, resulting in the almost complete destruction of the city of Lisbon and still affecting much of the Algarve coast
and Setúbal
The earthquake was followed by a tidal wave - believed to have reached a height of 20 meters - and multiple fires, certainly causing more than 10,000 deaths (some point to many more)
It was one of the deadliest earthquakes in history, marking what some historians call the prehistory of Modern Europe
Seismologists estimate that the 1755 earthquake reached magnitudes between 8
7 to 9 on the Richter scale
The Lisbon earthquake had a huge political and socioeconomic impact on Portuguese society in the 18th century, giving rise to the first scientific studies of the effect of an earthquake in a wide area, thus marking the birth of modern seismology
The event was widely discussed by Enlightenment philosophers, such as Voltaire, inspiring significant developments in the field of theodicy and the philosophy of the sublime
[sauce]
85% of the buildings of one of the richest cities in the world were destroyed
I can't even imagine how much was lost, from libraries to museums
At least 46 palaces were pulverized
Do not forget about the massive fire afterwards that fully destroyed downtown capital
And the hundreds that died in the pillaging that followed
It was a disaster as we cannot even imagine
The azores are right in a three tectonic plate intersection, the American, Eurasian and African plates, so yeah, it can be unstable
There's basically several small earthquakes each year near the coast in Algarve and Lisbon
I'd say bacalhau
I mean we definitely eat it, but mostly on special occasions or when at a restaurant
It's not the type of thing I'd cook on any old day of the week
Spanish people order a lot of bacallao dorado, golden cod, which I did not know what it is, but from the other thread apparently is Bacalhau à brás. We eat it but do not call it that
I hear brazillians talk of something called Bacalhoada as a codfish dish, I do not know what it is either
We got a lot of cod recipes though
Nando's and periperi sauce - we eat a lot of frango de churrasco with piripiri (different spelling and also different sauce as far as I can tell) but nando's food is just different as far as I can tell
Maybe because souflés are always a bitch
Yeah definitely a dish for when you've got time to spend cooking
I usually only eat it at family meals or when having dinner with friends
That is kind of funny
I mean it is a bit of stereotype, which is why they most likely chose the name, but it's as random as calling it "Codfish" in English

Sorry, my brain wasn't getting there
we use notebooks but:
math-green
science-blue
portuguese-red
french-blue
physics-green
I feel you, I'm so confused by all this
My textbooks, all had a plain black or blue cover
I never had a folder with any colors as well
Just plain black notebooks
One for each course
I'm not sure if this is what the thread is about, but the only "customizable" thing we had were the notebooks, in which we took notes in class
Maybe that's what the OP means
Still, if it's that, I'm not sure we had the colors thing
At most, the notebooks had a strip of color at the end of each page and each notebook had like 4 of 5 different colors, you could assign to each subject
But I - and I think most people - did it randomly each year or every time they started a notebook
Otherwise, people just bought the notebooks they liked the best
In my later school years, the most common type of notebooks were [the small, cheap black ones] usually one of per subject
I think he might be talking about either that you were saying or those dossier separators, you know
Those were differently coloured (bad word) to each class
Oh, right, of course
Not many people used those, in my experience, as they're just not very practical
They're quite bulky to carry around and usually didn't last long, with the pages easily torning from revolving them too much
I think kids in early school years, with less subjects and less stuff to write down used them more
Still, is there a specific color coding for those, though
I think people just used to assign them randomly or at most, put the most common subjects like Portuguese or Math right at the beginning, regardless of the color, just because it's more practical to open the dossier and find those right away

Our winters, you are really really going to feel the cold
OTOH sun in December, it is awesome
Well, after reading your comment, I am not sure what I am supposed to say or even doing here
Yes, and things in Switzerland are twice as expensive
German wages comparing to expenses continue to be one of the best in Europe
In Portugal we get half of german wages and things are the same or more expensive
This show no understanding in the reality in the rest of Europe and the World
Pretty sure we're not much better either
Probably the Azores, the smaller islands
My bet would be on Algarve, everyone goes there on vacation and I never heard somebody say they hated Algarve
I would say either Lisbon or Coimbra and Porto they are generally regarded has the most popular
Porto and Lisbon are kinda rivals, they both have a great number of the population, although living in the actual city's are becoming increasingly impossible do to tourism ruining the housing market and increasing sound pollution, both this cities are beautiful, Lisbon is an ancient city with wonders everywhere too many to list, and Porto has a bit of 18/19 century charm with their bridge made by eiffel
Coimbra is the city of the higher education, its not has popular has the previous 2 but its generally liked by everyone
For cities I was thinking Coimbra or Leiria
I feel like no one dislikes either of those
I was thinking about it, and for living I would say Aveiro
I never met anyone who lived there and didn't like it
Cacia smell
Where you detect it depends from wind direction - and if the mill is running
It can be a bit sickening
Until some years ago, Lidl was cheap and low-quality products, and their stores didn't looked good, but then they improved a lot, although they're not considered the best or premium, their products are good or very good, their stores have a much better and more modern decoration and they sell good bread, which can be seen as a sign of not being a cheap supermarket
Lidl is still seen as a low price supermarket, but not so extreme as some years ago
Its good
It has those 1 or 2 things no other supermarket has
A few years ago it was the only one that had stuff like fresh bread every day, croissants, donuts, and some things that were like croissant dough and inside it could have like meat, chesse and ham, sausage ( here its called "folhado", dont know the english name)
Overall i dont have any specific complains and the quality is good
in Portugal there is Lidls but most people don't go them and its not too much popular
Lidl is seen as a kind of "limited" supermarket, they do not have a big selection and the stores look a bit basic, though they are attacking the portuguese market with more high end looking stores, and bakeries and in a few cases in store fresh fish shops
They often just carry their own brand of some items, which can seem a bit limiting
But I think particularly in Portugal, everybody cross shops, the poorer people often use more the supermarkets close to them but everybody might use whichever supermarket is closest
Lidl puts out this weekly newspaper which reaches lots of people
Aldi is also expanding in Portugal but keeping many very german things, and it has this very unexpected niche - the aisle of special things, some of which have a reputation for being very good (electronics, cookware, tools, cosmetics) and they have this big range of food for people with alternate dietary requirements (vegans, people on high protein diets, gluten free, lactose free and so on) which means they can catch a lot of very different people
Lupin vegan icecream, protein bars, lactose free cheese, stuff like that
It's great for those ridiculous promotions when it comes to appliances
My aunt, for instance, bought a super cheap sewing machine there during a promotion, and my mom has bought a toastie iron and other at much lower prices
For regular stuff, you go there for the convenience because it's close and small, but the quality isn't great and it's not that cheap compared to other places
It's considered a good supermarket, with the best bread you can find
Yeah
I'd say they've gone up in reputation, really: they're now kind of middle-grade, certainly over Minipreço and the like
I think you'd be surprised
I've been in a lot of Lidls (in fact, I go to one semi-regularly) and it certainly isn't deserted
Yea, my hometown lidl was also bulldozed and rebuild to a newer one
I'm surprised that they invest a lot on their appeal
That depends on the person
I don't have any real life friends, but I have some online ones and none of them are female
I just find it harder to relate to women, I guess
When I was a kid in the '90s, most little kids usually preferred to hang out with kids of the same age and gender when they're playing, since they had similar interests
Many adults and other kids do that teasing thing when they see a boy and a girl together: "Hey, is that your girlfriend/boyfriend
" which makes a kid terribly uncomfortable
With games like hide-and-seek or catch, you would see a mixed group of boys and girls, not so much when they were playing soccer, usually, only the girls who were talented at sports wanted to play
As teenagers and adults, that usually stops and you usually see a much of boys and girls hanging out together as a group of friends
When I was in college my class consisted of 110 female students and 20 male (medical school), there were a lot of female-only groups, but you usually had 1 or 2 boys in the group
My group of friends was 6 girls and one guy, who already had a girlfriend back home, and we hung out as friends
No one ever teased him of having a harem
Usually we say "Estou
" (or 'tou if you want to abbreviate) for some reason
I never really understood why, because it literally means "I am"
Informal calls are started normally by “‘Tou
”, but formal calls are started by “Estou sim
Daqui fala [name]”
We say "Estou" or "Tou", estou comes from the verb estar, which is basically the verb to be
(note: the verb to be has 2 variants in portuguese, the verb "estar" and the verb "ser")
Yeah it's a bit weird, because it is not an affirmation, it's a question
We actually ask "Am I?". It's very philosophical if you think about it
For the furniture and bulky, large appliances, the most usual method is to include delivery
Less common, but unheard of, is renting a Van
For drywall, I had to find a translation
Preplastered wall boards, usually gypsum plaster on wooden/cardboard support
I would think the same thing, although I have yet to see those systems in use on private homes, TBH
We usually plaster/render the bricks/blocks that are in the interior wall, and then paint them
Usually the place you buy the items from has a delivery service (sometimes free)
If that's not the case, you can always rent transport services or ask your friend or family member that has a van
I believe it goes both ways, quebecois also use english loanwords that french people, in turn, usually don't use, like «chum»
Not USA by the beach
I’ll grab the tremoços
Ditto with you and Swiss Germans/Austrians
You’re probably more likely to try to speak German if not speaking to a German
The only other term I know, besides babysitter, is "ama-seca" which is kind of old-timey and it means "dry nurse" as opposed to a "ama-de-leite" (wet nurse)
I think the most colloquial terms I've ever seen to refer to babysitting jobs have always used roundabout wording like "toma-se conta de crianças" = we watch over/take care of children
And they weren't exactly very common ads, as it were
I think people either use daycares or ask the grandparents for help, more often than not
To be fair here having someone not from the family or friends babysitting is very rare
From my experience (upper-middle class from Porto) it just isn't a paid job
Frequently my grandparents, aunts or family friends watched me over when needed
It's a very foreign concept here, I think it has to do with income inequality and how class functions in Brazil
I'm going to have to side with your portuguese friends, here, because I've also never heard that word before
Wait, schools taught you how to do stuff at home
I did not
Sometimes we didn't even have running water
Same thing here
> Each year parents have to sign you up for them, so you don't have to attend them if your parents don't want you to
So not mandatory ...
Personally I don’t like it, if people want citizenship the least they could do is learn the language
I was in Poland for just 6 months and I felt the need to at least know the basics of the language to help get around, I can’t comprehend that somebody asking for citizenship wouldn’t do the same
I mean learning Portuguese is extremely hard, even harder is the European version of portugueses do to the complex sounds variation etc
From my knowledge has law student, and i admit ignorance at this subject (if i make a mistake pls correct me in the comments i appreciate learning), there's 3 way of gaining citizenship:
* 1 either being born in Portuguese territory or in a Portuguese vessel like a plane or boat, or claiming citizenship from a being descendant of a Portuguese citizen
Exp you are in vacation and you came to Portugal and wife has kid in Portugal, he's a Portuguese, let's say that kid grows up in your original country of his parents, and his kid's that were born there can claim Portuguese citizenship from being descendant, although this goes until the 5 generation past that is no
* 2 is normal application for citizenship when the previous doesn't apply, that from what i understand is hard to get do to some Inefficiency and hard criterias
* 3 is buy investing in the country a certain amount of money, this is called vistos gold, i understand and compreende why they exist but at a fundamental level i cannot agree with their existence because its goes against any moral values because it discriminates base on income access to a right
What if everyone speaks English
I don’t think not speaking the local language means you can’t interact with locals
Well
have you actually tried it
Not being 100% comfortable with a language doesn’t mean that they don’t want to connect and make friendships
And that’s very good, learning languages is great
I just don’t think everyone needs to do that, that’s all
I'd argue accents are fine, as long as you're understood
Everyone has one
Agreed
I studied Communication Design in Portugal, and before that Architecture (until I decided it wasn't for me)
We pretty much had to pay for our own stuff
In Architecture you could make use of spare materials lying around, like card and k-line, but there was hardly any so we had to buy our own
There was a laser cutter, wood cutter, and 3D printer, but iirc it was hard to get permission to use them, so most people used services outside the university
In Communication Design we also had to buy our own materials outside of the campus, and although we had to pay the printers, we had a discount at least
In Architecture we had a free student license for Autodesk software, but in Communication Design not once did the lecturers talked about how to access Adobe software
I think the idea was that we'd ask for permission to access the school's iMac room, but everyone just illegally downloaded the software
I then did a master's in Scotland and it was more or less the same as in Portugal, except we could use laser cutters and 3D printers free of charge (among other things) so long as we signed our names beforehand and waited for our turn
We were also given very little direction on how to set up our exhibitions for the degree show, which was very stressful
As for projects done whilst studying at university, I don't believe they ever stated that said work belongs to them
As far as I know we could do freelance projects and not owe the university anything
And I don't think any projects done for university belonged to them either
Wait, but she gave you all of the money or a cut
If it is March 21st ( first day of spring varies and it was later before 2000 because February 29th 2000 was a reset which happens every 400 years in Gregorian calendars) no
In fact it is tree day here, for primary school and kindergarten students often activities are about trees and sometimes really nice
The last day of second period ( we have 3 school periods) the last day right before Easter holiday can be really quite crazy, and yeah skipping school or being very lazy day
Nah
Seems like a really random day for students to decide skipping school on

Portugal had a dead queen on the throne
Prince Pedro fell in love with his wife's handmaiden and had an affair with her, eventually marrying her in secret after his wife's death, but his father opposed and ordered her death
After Pedro became King, he exhumed her corpse, named her Queen and forced her killers to kiss her decomposing hand before ordering their deaths in front of him by ripping out their hearts, all the while he ate his lunch

It's a shame the story of Pedro and Inês isn't more well known abroad, it's like a real life Romeo and Juliet but better
Don't mind me, I'm just here to take the Portugal Train
Game Of Thrones level of death
Thats why I have Slovenian decendents that emigrated to germany in the early 20th century
Crazy
You Poles sure are a contentious people
Well, you have to balance the Swede's right to life with the right to feel safe, not to mention national security concerns
Come on board
Thanks
Did you hear about it here on Reddit
I think that's just America
I doubt Portugal has a plan to invade Mongolia
If anything portugal has a plan to NOT invade anyone
No, I was talking about the Swede walking on ice water, that's very dangerous for Denmark
Our plan is to do whatever the British tell us to do, which is problematic, because the British plan is to do whatever the Americans tell them to do
That's why we got involved in Iraq
T. Alberto Barbosa
Men and women with moustache
Fado music is mostly a Lisbon and Coimbra thing
Bullfighting also isn't overwhelmingly popular
A lot of people dislike it or don't care about it at all
Plus, it's more popular in the Center/South and South parts of the country than in the North
In Portugal, bullfighting is actually seeing a rise
The last televised fight was seen by more than 15% of the population and the arenas are almost always full
I refuse to believe Russians don't ride bears to work
We have those in Portugal too
It isn't overwhelmingly popular but has seen a rise in recent times and a 25% increase in arena attendance
Isn't that a romance countries thing
Like in Portugal we also eat some dishes made with snails, and i think that also applies to Spain and other romance countries
But it exists here and a lot of people know it does and aren't aware that it's more of a regional thing and can be a controversial thing to talk about
Also, Catholicism
We're not a super religious nation like some foreigners assume we are
Our traditional bullfighting is with the horse, like the rejoneo, with spikes and blood and all of that
But we also have the forcados, like you showed that come after the horse
They are suposed to catch the bull
The biggest difference is that we dont kill the bull in the arena
If the bull is brave he goes to reproduction and if dont he is killed and eaten
British probably wouldn't drink tea if it weren't for the portuguese
When sailors were bored during the long voyages  during the Ages of Discoveries, some would catch a shark, place it in the ship and play touradas (bullfighting) with it
Portugal has basically a world wide monopoly on Cork wood applications, because the rest of the world only uses it has Cork for the wine bottles, we use to make wallets shoes helmet interiors instead of foam etc
Also we are the biggest producer of Cork wood so chances are that your bottle Cork wood is Portuguese
We're first (if u don't count the Viking) but Spain gets all the credit
Hey, we too
The expression "girls are made of spice and everything nice" came from the Portuguese Queen Catherine of Braganza who married the English King and brought both the habit of the 5 o'clock tea and spices with her dowry
Portugal also handed Bombay to Britain as a gift, it was called Boa Baía, which means "Good Harbour".
The British treated her like garbage because she was Catholic, tried to kill her for "treason" and her husband cheated on her repeatedly and even placed his mistress as her hand-maiden
When he died, Catherine finally came home to Portugal where she eventually died after serving as counselor to her nephew, the King

>modern Turkey has more skyscrapers than all Europe combined except Russia
Not surprising, most europeans think of skyscrapers as an eyesore
In almost every city the highest building is a church tower and people actively oppose building anything higher than what was already built
11:32 minutes
that didnt end in the [Treaty of Edinburgh] in 1560
They were bored, had scurvy and going insane with cabin fever, playing with sharks instead of killing each other was the better solution for the crew
Well, tbf, in most places of the world they are seen as a sign of progress, just not in Europe
For most of my life I thought every house/apartment had estores/persianas
Now I can't imagine moving anywhere but Spain because I literally couldn't live without them
Thing is, there's stuff with similar names in other countries but they're not the same thing, though they typically have a similar shape
Here in Portugal we have croquetes but they're made of mince meat
And I think in France a croquette is made of potatoes
The Netherlands is simply a depressing place gastronomically
No I don't think so although I did try a lot of the Dutch fried snacks
Pastel de nata
It's popularity overseas has been rising thru the roof and it's well worth it
[pastel de nata]
Thera are a lot of dessert, but my favorite is "Serradura"
I am not sure and definitely not a favorite of mine, but I would like to hear from other European countries if they have it or not: bread with marmalade and cheese
When I say bread, I mean regular bread, cut like a sandwich
not a cake
Edit: the most popular, because its cheap, its only with marmalade
Oh look, a mil-folhas
(thousand-sheets)
Funny, we have many of those, but slightly different and not as popular as they are there
Do you have the [churros with filling] Those with chocolate like Nutella
oh, boy
We also make this version called [fartura] It's hot and crunchy on the outside, and very soft (almost melts in your mouth when it's fresh) on the inside
Now I'm hungry
Pastéis de nata aren't dessert, they're more afternoon pastries than something in a real meal
pastéis de nata are not desserts
Best dessert ever
Love it
Bolo de bolacha, suponho
Bah, amateur
Ehehehe
You just can't stop, can you
The crispy crust, the sweet filling and that lovely powdered sugar and cinnamon just make it perfect
See what you did
Now I gotta get out to buy some
Very nice also and really easy to make at home
No one to try and step on the back of a Portuguese,  as another Portuguese
Here we see our lovely " crabs in a bucket" attitude
Well, I love to have an expresso and a pastel de nata at the end of my meals
Can I keep on doing it
Or can I commit the heresy of having a nata as breakfast
Regular bread, French type, not toasted
Not the best example, but like this [one]
Not a fan, as I said, an improbably combination, but it doesn’t taste that bad
Give it a try and let me know
Not a fan, also found it weird
We call those "russos" (it means russians, but that's a name we give things that are white washed-off, like old clothes or gray hair), mostly because we cover them with powdered sugar
I will because no one in this coutry does look at them as dessert
It's like saying you eat a croissant or a pain au chocolat in a big meal
you can also eat pizza for dessert, no one is stopping you
does that also make pizza a dessert
You are free to do it only societally it's not a thing in Portugal
Same as having antipasti or usually having a sandwich for lunch
That we got our independence from Spain, which we did not, since there was no Spain then
We became independent from the Kingdom of Léon around 1143 (definitions vary depending which treaty or papal bull you consider the official instrument of independence)
Actually, I think a bigger misconception about Portugal would be that it's a province of Spain or a former Brazillian colony
You has well ? :)
No, because that was not a political union, and it was not our independence
It was a personal union, not a political union, in that the same person was separetely king of both parts
But the army, courts, laws, the empire, was independent
>Portus Cale (the Duchy of Porto
You got a bunch of concepts confused up
Porto, Portus just means harbour, and the Cale part (Gaia now) would be even more the name
Nobody knows what that root means, but it is probably related to the Gal- in Galicia or Gaul
The condado portucalense, the portuguese county got its independence from the kingdom of Leon, but it was never a duchy (there were no dukes in Portugal till a royal bastard in the late 15th century), and its capital was not Porto, but Braga, with Guimarães being very important on its history also
There are two cities right accross each other, on the mouth of the river there
Porto is one, the other is Gaia, Vila Nova de Gaia
The name of Portugal probably comes from both of them, and the Gaia part is more important, unique, since Porto/Portus just means harbour
Harbour of Gaia, maybe
When the county existed the name applied to the whole region, and its capital was actually Braga
We don't have anything of the sort here in Portugal as far as my knowledge goes
Yeah
At least here, it is
We learn everything about it, the good and the bad, but somehow we always end up romanticising it all
Talking about how great we were at the sea and how much we conquered through it, that’s means of course that although we learn about the bad we tend to “forget” about it when speaking about how great our empire was
With this I don’t mean to say that everything about it was bad (especially) because I don’t believe it was but it does put my mind at ease when we talk about how we learn from our mistakes and that in time we ended up “correcting” them the best that we could
I can't talk for every Portuguese, obviously
But, before I started using Reddit and other forms of social media in English, I used to be rather critical and cynical about the romanticizing of the Portuguese empire, though it was over the top
However, after seeing the indifference and lack of knowledge that a lot of people seem to have about the Portuguese empire, I started to become more defensive about the subject lol
I agree though I might be a bit biased
Tokyo, nagoia, hiroshima and Nagasaki (because
You know), Osaka and that's about it

Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Nagasaki, Yokohama, Nagano,  Hiroshima, Sapporo
Tokyo, Fukushima, Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Nagoya, Yokohama, Hamamatsu, Kyoto, Sendai and Kōbe
That's about it
Tokyo, Osaka, Hiroshima, Nagazaki and i can't think of anything else, sorry
Definitely [José Hermano Saraiva] which over the years presented multiple shows about Portuguese history
I remember that show, it was great
And we surely miss him dearly
when I was a teenager I used to watch his shows over any cartoons or movies
I would say André Ventura
He Is the leader of CHEGA
(ENOUGH
) a new far right wing party
You know, that kinda of ultra nationalist party that the left loves to call fascists
He as been envolved in a lot of controversies since he was elected to parliament (and before that), especially for speaking against the gypsy community
Recently he propesed a "specific confinement for the gypsy community" and got a lot of hate for it
He was heavilly criticized by Ricardo Quaresma (a gyspsy football player) and is considered a racist by many people
André Ventura, he is the portuguese far-right party leader
This guy was a football commentator that supported Benfica, so he got a lot of traction because more than half of Portugal's population are also Benfica supporters
We have a rich left-wing history, so, so far he's not getting huge results, but the trend is changing, and I foresee him getting good results in a near future
I love you for that
But he should be in jail nonetheless
I would argue José Sócrates, for obvious reasons
Good question
USA is still world's biggest agent in geopolitical matters, and so far has been Europe's closest ally, as Huntington wrote we share the same ideologies and culture creating, therefore, the Western Civilization
So considering that Trump is making USA isolate from the long lasting ties with Europe, somehow it affects directly the influence of Europe's sphere
And this can be interpreted by Europeans in two ways
Either is time for Europe to create stronger bonds and give more power to the EU so we remain a key player in worlds geo politics, and I vibe with this since we've been the bastion of rich democracies
Or we go down in history and will be pushed around by authoritarian regimes like China, India and Russia
So back to your question
For now, europeans don't like Trump's ideals but not hate the person itself since it doesn't affect us yet
But only time and the New World Order will tell
He said right now, so I think André Ventura is a better answer (even though Sócrates is still hated by a lot of people)
It's a first name in Portugal too
I still hate Jose Sócrates and will be an hater forever
His actions were far more damaging to Portugal than anything that Ventura can do
I am no fortune teller
But Biden seems to have no chance
Sure, but he isn't really a thing anymore
I agree with you
It's just that Ventura is under the spot light right now and I think it is a better answer because of that
Usually no, our toasts are on a grill, except one famous notorious exception which is called the francesinha
Not sure I would call it fried, but it certainly goes into a frying pan
Yes we do
You can find it in every corner, they are called "Tosta mista" which include cheese+ham
Another thing i usually add is a mix of ketchup+mayo and those mini "fried stick chips" that i have no idea how to translate
Yeah i too use a toaster
Let's just say it's our little secret ok
Its not like the usual fried chips like mc donalds, they are like really thin and little
Search for batata palha (in portuguese)
Oh right, you guys use it a lot in street hot dogs right
We are a warm, cheap and safe country for the people from important european countries to spend their hollidays in
We also export our brightest minds to said important countries bc the smart people dont want to stay in this shithole country
They know they can make a lot more elsewhere in the EU
So there it is
Natural beauty and bright minds
Let British people retire in Algarve and mainly cooking cod in a thousand different ways
We the Portuguese also love to invest money on our only national airline that only knows how to lose money
Do you wanna be hit with the bread shovel
Because that's how you get hit with the bread shovel
portuguese
spanish people refuse to learn another language and thus never immigrate
Oh i like it too but it is taking all of our money away
It has one of the lowest immigration rates in westerm Eu
So not really
Since after the roman empire you're full of excuses, stop it Italy
I cant remember anyone in Modern history
I would say the three mans that betrayed Viriato
Viriato was a lusitanian leader that fought very successfully against the Roman but was killed by three soldiers that were paid by the Romans
Cant remember his exact name (D.Pedro i think) but he basicaly escaped to Brasil and gave then the independence and alot of technological progress and almost didnt care about Portugal itself
>D.Pedro
I think you're skipping a big part of history there, man
D. Pedro IV of Portugal (and D. Pedro I of Brazil) did escape Portugal
as a child, with the rest of the royal family, during the French Invasions (also known as the Peninsular Wars)
He also did declare the independence of Brazil from Portugal, and it was exactly that that made him abdicate the Portuguese throne in benefit of his daughter, D. Maria II
His brother, D. Miguel, then tried to seize power and reestablish absolutism (which had just ended) , which made Pedro abdicate from his throne as Emperor of Brazil (in benefit of his son, also named Pedro) and return to Portugal to fight his brother to reestablish the short-lived constitutional monarchy (in the Liberal Wars), in which he was sucessful, and return Maria II to power
He was no traitor
Yeah those are the boring bits of history i forget
My bad and thanks
A homeless woman gave birth and immediately after put her, alive and breathing, baby in recycling bin, the baby was then found barely hanging to life by a couple of homeless people that were walking by that heard the baby barely crying
There's plenty of outrage, the defence of this women is or is going to claim insanity and metal health problems so that she's not punish with jail with attempted infanticide and abandoned of family, and instead be treated by a mental health facility
There's a few problems with that because there's some doubts about her mental health
The population hates this incident because of obvious reasons
A Homeless woman left a newborn baby in a trash bin in Lisbon
She Copulated for drug money, and the baby was an "woops".
Last week a homeless woman, 20 years old, left her newborn to die on a recycling bin, still with the umbilical cord attached to the baby
The baby was then found 15 hours later by a homeless man, the area around the bin is occupied by groups of homeless people, and sent to the hospital, where he is stable and healthy
This event created a big discussion on the news and social media about homelessness and the moral aspect of the crime
As for now the girl that threw the newborn away is on prison awaiting trial and has been reported that she refused help from the state before and during her pregnancy
Also, our public health system is "collapsing" and it seems that every other day there is some new hospital closing, during certain hours, due to the lack of specialized staff
Sometime after I moved to Lisbon I got sick
Went to a restaurant and ordered some chicken soup
It was made with rice
Why would someone do that
After that I asked around and learnt that in South Portugal they cook it like that
There are all sorts of difference between North/South Portugal because even though we're a small country until maybe the 80s people were born, lived and died in the same village
Chicken soup with rice is the original
It is calle canja from the chinese congee, which is made with rice
Pasta is not a crime, if you must, but it is people who make it with pasta which are deviating from tradition
People in the 16th or 17th century certainly were not buying small shape pasta to make canja
I'm from southern Portugal and we do chicken soup sometimes with rice and othertimes with pasta
I used to have with rice when I was sick
Chicken soup with rice is an outright culinary abomination
puta que pariu oh mano, sopa com arroz devia ser crime
If I showed my German father a Bayern-München jersey I would probably be kicked from house
I think regional rivalries are mostly shown by football now
And if I showed with a BVB jersey I would probably be killed (Schalke fan)
Ministério da Defesa Nacional which roughly translates to Ministry of National Defense
I'm not corrupt
I don't really like bacalhau
For some reason, people don't believe me or even take offence when I say I don't like codfish
Corruption
Not being able/willing to save money or manage money both private and public funds
I suck at football and I don't really like watching the games either
Codfish is not my favorite fish
I don't know what the bigger shame for a Fin is, you not liking Saunas or you actually being social
Next thing you're going to say you don't drink either
So you like to hang with dudes wirhout clothes
I don't like wine and love beer
Wanna switch places
You'd fit right in here
I was going to say the same xD
- For Englishman to see: refers to a half-assed gig that only looks good in the surface
"De Espanha nem bom vento nem bom casamento" (From Spain no good wind nor a good marriage, meaning nothing good comes from Spain )
"Deves ser espanhol tu a ver as coisas" (you must be Spanish for seeing stuff) it refers to someone that's seeing something while touching it a lot when they shouldn't or its not really appropriate
"ver-se Grego" or "isto para mim é Grego" (seeing ourselves Greek; this for me is Greek
the first means having a difficult time with something, the second means something too difficult for me to understand
In Portugal to kids, when they keep touching things at the store or smth we say "stop touching things you're not Spanish"
"À grande e à Francesa"- Big and french-like, roughly, meaning, doing something outlandish and expensive
Not really a saying, but we have ["Francesinha"] meaning little french girl which is quite possibly one of the best things in portuguese cuisine
It is basically a sandwich with tons of different meats, served with a somewhat spicy sauce and french fries (ironically, french fires in portuguese does not refer the french in any way)
"Isso é chinês para mim" or "Estás a falar em chinês", meaning That is chinese to me, or You're speaking in chinese, when someone says something you don't understand
And then "De Espanha nem bons ventos nem bons casamentos"- From Spain, no good winds nor good weedings
If we need to vomit we say "I will call the Greek" and the act of vomiting is: gregar (kind of "making the Greek") no idea why
"Devo estar a falar [Insert Foreign Language Here]" (I must be speaking [Insert Foreign Language Here]) It's used in Portugal when in an argument and someone doesn't understand or continuously ignores what you're saying
We use this especially with languages such as Chinese, Japanese, Russian, German, Mandarin, etc
you forgot "From Spain don't come good winds nor good marriages"
So the answer to my chronic underachieving is that I'm just Russian
Tenho a impressão que veio do Brasil até em relação com a não abolição da escravatura
That is not a nationality
It says that people from Spain aren't good partners what isn't a nationality
being spanish
apparently conguitos
People sleep better when they are warm but sleeping cold air
Adults as well
> I was an exchange student in the UK I remember being shocked to find out we couldn't ask questions during a lecture
That's strange
Thought you could ask questions during a lecture everywhere
I think we need one of these for /r/Portuguese
English natives learning the language are constantly wondering there how this works and it doesn't help it's vastly different between Brazilian and European Portuguese
where are you from
grew up
you got no flair
Because if something looks racist or not, to a society, depends on its mores
Americans have a specific code for racism, they had minstrel shows, and they have this huge load of associations with minstrel shows, which were used to mock and put down african americans for centuries
But I have seen americans be completely full of shit seeing racism in things which are not (asking an african american if they want chicken, in Portugal, or some hype about colonel Sanders in a japanese summer promotion being tanned and eating watermelon)
I agree
It's so good for the mind too
Having a longer lunch hour, with good food and good company helps us keep our minds free from the stress of work, so when we get back in the afternoon, it feels like we're starting a fresh day
Not to mention when it turn them into full events, like those big lunches with family or friends that literally last the whole day
They're great
Well sounds like the UK is a good place for teachers with a huge ego who just want to hear themselves talk
You are american
You are offended by different things than others are
americans think it terribly racist if somebody is wearing facial paint for the epiphany cortege to play Balthazar
You are living in a foreign country, maybe it is time to think that different cultures got different contraints and cultural associations
Hard to do if you have a fixed schedule to keep to (like open hours to the public, for instance)
> The Conguitos mascot is a cartoon that intentionally parodies the physical appearance of black people
If you parody the physical appearance of people of other races, say dutch kids, or chinese kids, or dunno viking kids, or mayan kids, is it all racist
What do black spanish people think, compared to black foreigners
Is it parodying white people racist
I know
But let us get back to if parodying white people (say dutch kids, or viking kids or italian kids) is racist as well
clogs, snub noses, round faces, butter yellow hair
French guys with stripe shirts and a beret and a baguette
The french are certainly mocked a lot
And my point is, what is mocked, what is a sore point, it varies from culture to culture and it is a bit overwhelming of americans to assume all the rest of the world has the same history of minstrel shows and Jim Crow, and watermelon and chicken and whatever that I do not even understand
( it took me a long time to learn about the watermelon and the chicken I am not sure I even understand)
Bullfights
Just, WHY
Well in some areas up north have a celebration like carnival, people dress up with multiple colours suits with a paper like texture, and if my memory doesn't fail me, only the boys dress like that and they try to kiss the girls or at least be playful with them
Even higher north in trás dos montes there's a marcial art fighting style that involves only a stick, at least according to stories from my ancestors from there
They are unique and fun to watch
Yeah, probably what I hate the most about this country, fuck anyone who supports it
The forcados are the only good thing to ever come out of it
Except the Forcados
Catching a bull with your bare hands
Now that is awesome
It's a thing in Portugal, Spain, south of France and latin america (only in some ex spanish colonies, in Brazil it's unheard)
Its a very split thing and he also did alot of good things, some people say it was good he existed other people dissagre
But its Salazar, a dictactor but not as fascist as german and italy dictatorships
Where do I start
We once lost our country to Spanish rule
When D. Sebastião marched much of our country's nobility into Morroco in an attempt to lead a great crusade against the Moors
The dumbfuck decides to march into the middle of the desert and lead the army personally
That's alright
He died
That's alright, we get his son on the throne
He doesn't have a son, he's almost a child
Ok, get his brother on the throne
His dad died even before he was born, he didn't have a chance to make another kid
Alright, alright, think
Does he have any other relatives
Yes
Who
A 90 year old cardinal
For fuck's sake Sebastião!
And the French failed their invasion so hard they tried three times
And we did kind of play a huge role in the Atlantic slave trade
And the Methuen treaty
And the mess after the monarchy was abolished
More like, we were doing fine with no nobles and no church and then D. Manuel decided to give them back the power
*Then* we lost the country to Spain
We were basically asking for it by then
The irish font is beautiful
Aren't the conditions too harsh for major human settlements
I've thought that if Russia developed its easternmost coast there could be many major trade routes there and the world would change a bit, with the US on the other side and China, Japan and SK close
The okhotsk region seems to be a litlle forgotten by everyone (at least non Russians) but with its geography it could be a very interesting hub
Cheap but cool thrift shops
Cheerfulness and openness
Hmmm
for some reason I can relate to that
I'm with you
Then there are some cool thrift shops on Instagram but the prices are high you're better off buying something new
That is so true
If I didn’t have money with me a couple of times, I would be in troubles, because they didn’t accept card payment
Also I couldn’t redraw in a lot of ATMs
Somebody explained that Germany, or at least some areas, don’t adopt the most common payment system used in the rest of Europe
But I am not sure about that, but there must be a technical and bureaucratic explanation for it
I'll swap you that for central heating in the Winter (jk I can't afford air conditioning)
I agree
Visited your country many times, love it, but always ended up at Migros buying bread, cheese and cold cuts
You are not alone
Dresden was a miserable experience when comes to that
Tip: go to Santander and redraw cash in their ATM
Since I travel a lot and visit thrift shops everywhere, I agree with my Portuguese fellow redditors
The point is that in here a thrift shop with cool stuff would probably charge you 15 or 20, instead of 4
The problem is that we mostly have extremes: either they are super cheap, but lacking cool or neat stuff; or they have neat stuff, but are kind of expensive (at least considering what they are selling)
In other words, thrift shops in here take themselves too seriously, like they are selling antiques or vintage or whatever
For example, you want to buy a new jacket but the one you like costs 60€ so you decide to look for a similar one on an Instagram "cool" thrift shop
They, in fact have a jacket similar to the one you like
Cool, it must be really cheap compared to the brand new one since it's used and has probably 5 to 10 years
You check the price and it's 50€ plus shipping
I just draw a perfect recreation of the Z in the DBZ logo
In all seriousness I draw it sometimes with a middle stroke, sometimes without
Middle stroke when I want to reinforce the fact that it's a capital letter
Same here but that "3" z is common if you write in cursive
Yes, most people have them
Since there are so many people named Ana, Maria or José, they are usually called by their second name
50/50, and when it's used its barely used, if that makes sense
Yes they are extremely common but rarely used with a few exceptions, we also have 2 last name but those are always used
For example some girls are named Ana Rita some just perfer being called Ana other girls only perfer being called Rita other perfer the 2 when referring to them
yes, very
Yes I even got a da or (of) in my name make its full length 5  words
Like this: 1st name- second name- family name
Yeah they are very common but never spoken
And for those three names plus João as a first name, people often go by the combination of both names too
Pretty common for someone to be known as, say, Ana Filipa or João Paulo
>5-7 names
Bit of an exaggeration, I'd say 3-6 is the expected amount
And some people do use two surnames as the standard form of their name, somewhat common in politics and the media for instance
Wait you officially changed your name to have your boyfriend's?
Okay but you use your boyfriend's name
Why
Most of them do
That has warrent some situations such as once where my mother was stopped at the reception of a place because they couldn't understand she was my father plus one even if she didn't have any of his surnames
The gun/military fetish
Saying they're Irish, German or something else when they're actually American
Ok, I get it, you're referring to your ancestry
But if you just say "I'm Irish" I'm gonna assume you mean, you know, your nationality
So don't tell a European you're Irish or a Chinese that you're Korean because people are gonna assume you mean the nationality
Also, referring to speakers of languages as if they're some sort of ethnic group
French-Canadians, for example
Or calling Mexicans and Puerto Ricans Spanish
Or referring to Brazilian singers as Portuguese singers
I'm not sure if this is an American thing or an English-language thing
No one in Portugal would refer to a Mexican as Spanish or an American comedian as an "English comedian".
I've actually noticed that sometimes Americans here on Reddit give out people's names for no reason when telling anecdotes from their lives
It's exactly the same in Europe
Warmer/southern countries will usually wear shoes inside, while colder/northern countries will not
You still need to get it back
[Casa da Música]  (music house) in Porto
The nightmare of civil engineers
I think the electricity company HQ, Champalimaud research centre, and the architecture, technology and art museum, are the best examples
Some people like Nova business school as well but I find it pretty meh
On the whole Lisbon isn’t great for modern architecture imo
Only city in Europe I’ve ever visited where the city centre isn’t the most beautiful part of town
Man honestly, you guys are smashing it
Can’t believe you achieved independence from the USSR in the 90s and you’re going to get high speed rail before we do
Weird, as I did this with the automated option
I think the problem was spacing
Everyone is welcome
We have wheelchair accessible ramps on our princess castle
Or you can use the trebuchet to be shot in like a proper medieval knight
Never heard of it, I've heard a folk music about it tho, in Finnish, so I didn't get a word, but they were moving artillery and playing with guns and it was snowing, so I'll assume it was about it
Briefly mention during History class, when we were briefly taught WW2

Biggest one is foreigners, particularly americans think drugs are legal in Portugal, meaning they thinkit is legal to buy, sell, grow, they got this totally different notion (and many get scammed because they are that stupid)
Net neutrality
4 years ago, that there was a coup in Portugal because the president invited the leader of the most voted party to be government
foreigners
> 4 years ago, that there was a coup in Portugal because the president invited the leader of the most voted party to be government
And then there was another coup because the 2nd most voted party formed the government
What a shock
Complaining to my friends about the Spaniards coming to Portugal speaking spanish hoping we will answer them while eating sardines
Being a Benfica fan
I avoid doing that too for the most part
I have this paranoia some lightning fast car will hit me and kill me
Yes, as far as I know berserkers reaved and fought while heavily intoxicated because death would bring them faster to Valhalla
Context: user above edited his post now; his first word was Viking
I honestly thought dual citizenship was commonplace in the EU, and I don't understand why anyone would be against such a thing
I have dual citizenship, Brazil and Portugal
It would be really messed up if I had to choose one over the other
Indeed we even have the minister of Justice with double nationality (Angolan), today's PSD candidate for Sintra's City Hall is also canadian, I think some of the president's grandchildren are also brazilian and so on
In that case yes, I can see it being a problem
> They can't control what another country says about a person and frankly they shouldn't care
That reminds me, anyone know the US' policy on this

In this type of posts no one usually mentions English but it's actually a very nice sounding language imo
English, with a Glaswegian accent
Not even joking
Italian a close second
Portuguese
Could you explain a little bit more
I don’t have a favorite, I do like some of the preciousness of Italian, and Spanish when spoke by Spanish women
Edit: I also like German, but don’t ask me why
i'm happy that your's is Portuguese
mine is Italian and right after Portuguese, Italian because i would love to be fluent in Italian, Portuguese because the language it's just beautiful, the hardest in the world to learn and i'm blessed that i was born speaking it
it's the other way around tho, Portuguese stands for perfection speaking and Spanish ( which in fluent too ) it's a little more '' drunk Portuguese ''.
I am not sure, I don’t found it particularly appealing, but at the same time there’s something fascinating in it
once I was watching a documentary and the voice-over was really breathtaking, I didn’t understand shit, but it was clearly beautiful (and looking at the subtitles, it was a really excellent text)
on the other way, we tend to be super expressive when we spoke (even if you don’t understand Spanish, Italian or Portuguese, just by the tone and facial expressions you kind of get what they are talking about), they aren’t so much, and that’s intriguing
No, but I get your point
I understand Italian, but I don’t speak very well, what I like about it its the use of expressions and words that are kind of “old school”, which give a certain refinement or elan to it
Is there a country, besides your own, that you don't like seeing insulted or ridiculed
Joking is alright, but some jokes are either tiresome or taken way too far
Personally, I don't like to hear any country being insulted, though ones I feel more strongly than others
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
Spain: don't mess with our hermanos, we're the only ones who get to make fun of them
Britain: it's insulted way too much and very unjustly in most cases
Brazil: Leave Brazil alone
France: the cowardice stereotype needs to die already
Germany: Enough with the Nazi-related stuff, they don't deserve this
Our fellow countries of Southern Europe - the PIGS jokes and "waste money on wine and women" mentally only shows how ignorant some people are
Spain
Basically grew up there
Or us, Spain, Italy and Greece
The PIGS jokes aren't fun anymore
I agree with Britain and Germany
Dude, no one cares anymore about all of that Nazi shit
Stop
And Britain, just, why
They're not more fancy or rich than any other country
People who joke about that just show ignorance and it pisses me off
Portugal
Even though I consider Portugal to be my country along with Brazil, I'm including it because Brazilians love to give the portuguese shit for no reason
Truth of the matter is, the portuguese people are some of the most lovely people I've ever met
Besides that, Germany and Russia
The Greek joke about the ruin economy has one of the most famous Greek ruins is getting really old
Although Its only funny if its in r/Polandball format
Not at all
Besides being a running gag from Monthy Python I don't get it either
I was in Poland for a year, thank god for Erasmus
Got to know their history, their cities, their people
I'm pretty defensive of them now
They're good people and honestly, seeing what we let happen in Poland during WW2, we're a bunch of freaking idiots
How do you feel about the Black Legend
Tell me about it, that's why I never read the comment section on any video about either country
It's really toxic
In real life though, Portuguese and Brazilians get on really well in here, at least from what I have seen
Please don't judge us from the idiots online
I live near Belmonte, and it's always so refreshing to see Brazilian visit the castle and looking so excited
The place is filled with Brazilian flags
I wish our two countries were as close as Britain and the USA
We may fight you but it's like brothers *pissing* on each other, if we see someone else insulting you we turn on our "dad" rage mode and start giving punches in all directions just to protect you
Same thing to all other former colonies
You're cool
Who's insulting Ireland
They're awesome
Aww
Thank you
We love you too :)
That one you can
They got our ships sunk along with theirs
I like german accents
They suck the hs in such a cute way
Reminds me of fish Klaus from American Dad
You can say that again
Hey, thank *you* for treating me so nicely over here
You guys are awesome
Cheers
I love monty python comedy
I wasn't aware of it until rather recently, and wow
That is so horrible and so untrue
I hate when people bring up how horrible the Spanish were, all colonizers were horrible at the time
Leave Spain alone, we're the only ones allowed to make fun of them
> I think he mean jokes in a bad way about the situation of the country
Yup
God, everyone said shit about us during the crisis
Even a couple of months ago had a tourist reminding me of the whole PIGS thing and I was ready to tell him to shove it where the sun doesn't shine
>however almost every time US has invaded a country they've been liberated from a certain totalitarian regime
You *do* know the US doesn't need to directly invade a country to be able to meddle in their politics, correct
Are you aware of how much shit they've done to Latin America, for example
De nada ;)
Americans are very stupid
Fortunately someone else pointed out they elected Trump and he stopped laughing
My father called me janico or janicó, when I was a kid (no idea what it means) and now just meu filho "my son"
I dont know about/cant remember about my parents
but mine is "Puto-Rocha" (literally translated is Rock-Dude") I think my father also has this name
My father treats me as "Cheio de sono" which roughly translates to "Full of sleep"
My mother used to call me "tentilhão" which means chaffinch, a cute small bird ressembling a sparrow which is often found here in Portugal
My grandpa used to call me "picanço", which means shrike and is also a bird but a not so cute one, they eat meat
No idea what my family's obsession with birds is, or how it relates to me, but I still found it cute
Well what about what we call our kids
I call my son many things, but chief among them are "Pirate", "Nocturnal Terror" and "Best thing in the world".
i think i solved that
As far as I know, you can only learn Brazilian Portuguese, which has quite some differences in grammar and vocabulary and a very different pronunciation
I see some "hate" towards Duolingo, but with all respect, I disagree
True, it lacks in some aspects (grammar could be explained better, we have to rely on the community discussions on the forums and other sources for that) but it is a really good app and a great way to get introduced to a language, for free
That being said, I don't think you can become fluent just from Duolingo, but is it helpful
Yes, a lot, specially if you use it properly (you need to build a habit, and don't rush through the lessons, learning a language takes time
Perhaps keeping a notebook of some kind as well)
Of course it's even better when you combine it with other sources of information
Also, the weird sentences you sometimes see are put there on purpose, it's supposed to help you memorise the vocabulary in a fun or different way
After all, learning a language is learning the vocabulary and the grammar rules, not predefined sentences
Some people don't like it, but I think it's good to have a few of those weird sentences alongside the useful ones, it works for me
With that out of the way, my native language is Portuguese, but Duolingo only has Brazilian Portuguese, which is quite different from the European one
Some words and grammar are different, but the biggest difference I'd say it's the pronunciation
I don't know much about the Duolingo course on it, but it seems to be as good as any other Duolingo course
it's teaching Brazilian portuguese and not Portugal Portuguese, although very similar they're quite different in pronnouciation (Brazilian is more sung, while Portugal's is like a Russian meeting a Spanish)
Awful
it will undo any grammatical knowledge you might have
It would be like if someone learnt AAVE posed as standard English
Duolingo in Portuguese is awful, exactly because it's Brazilian Portuguese
Verbal conjugations are impossible to learn correctly when they use third person for second person, frequently mismatch conjugations and ignore that plural you exists
PT-PT and PT-BR is much more different and diverse than British and American English are, in comparison
We, Portuguese, understand them very well because we are exposed to their culture (tv, music and a large immigrant community), but they struggle so much
Like imagine a American movie or series where a British character would speak in a fake British accent that is a mix of the two just so the American audience to understand
That happens quite a lot with Brazilian shows that feature Portuguese actors
It surely will, and I believe it's easier to learn than European Portuguese
You're right, when I said "as good as any other" I meant that it was probably your average Duolingo course, but there are certainly some better than others
I've done the Norwegian course on Duolingo, I can confirm that it is great, it's really well-structured like you said, I loved it
I'm in the middle of the Italian course now, it's not bad at all but feels like it needs an update
Those 2 are the only ones I've tried myself so I don't know what are the not so good courses
I've never done the Portuguese one, I've only seen little bits of it so I don't know for sure how good is it
And yes, I've always thought of Duolingo that way, it's a fun method to get started on a language or practice some vocabulary, it's not there to make you fluent
I certainly enjoy it
My thoughts exactly
> Verbal conjugations are impossible to learn correctly
PT-PT verbal conjugations
The app tells you upfront that it's PT-BR that you are learning
It's not ideally from our POV, but it's understandable from
For me it's worse when you are trying to learn a foreign language, being a PT-PT native, and sometimes you have mistakes in the exercises because you are not used to certain conjugations or expressions in PT-BR
it might have changed since the last time I used it, but it just said it was Portuguese, it did not announce itself as Brazilian Portuguese
also, verbal conjugations are the same in both Pt-Br and Pt-pt, but Duolingo tried to pass Pt-Br coloquial use as if it were the same as formal use, which did not happen in other languages it offers
-video games that have gambling mechanics that involve real world money either directly or indirectly should either be illegal to be sold to minors or at least implement methods that lock that feature out of minor range (if possible)
-although there are a few things that are already illegal here, in Portugal, that this thread mentions i would like to say its not enough making it illegal it needs to be in forced and be human resources capable of doing the inforcement of the law and some social public opinion agreement to work
Butchering the title
Bullfighting
I'm not against cigarettes, but I find it odd that it is legal to smoke while driving, and that nobody talks about this
For me, smoking while driving can be as dangerous as talking on the phone while driving and I think it should also be illegal
Not to mention all the cancerous particles that get stuck inside the car
"fuga ao fisco"
Let's say a worker earns 4000€ a month,
he would have to pay the taxes someone who earns 4000€ usually pays
But something which is usually done is claiming you only earn for example 2000€, so he pays the taxes someone who earns 2000€ would pay
In my opinion this is wrong, but not everything is bad, since when that worker retires, his pension will not be the equivalent to a 4000€ wage, but a 2000€ wage
Lol reading this thread has been insane
I had no idea there was so much fantastical thought
I dont think in Portugal we have any, and if we ever did people stopped speaking about them
Not much fantastical lore here
The only one I can remember is we used to say there was a giant at the souther point of Africa and that's why you couldn't cross
But after it was crossed, giant was disproven, name of the place changed and that was that
>A lake monster, that hasnt been reported for over 125 years because it moved to another lake a few cities away
I guess it got tired of being reported to the authorities for existing lol
There are tales of a dragon or cockatrice called Coca that lived in the North of Portugal were is now the town of Monção.
Wait
Europeans hate ceiling fans
Most of the time it's fine, because there's a good correlation between the ending of a noun and its gender, but some common endings like -e, -ão and -r are ambiguous
Plus there's a relatively small amount of possible endings I guess, since you can't end a word on most consonants
It's mostly based on context
Which means the same word could have different articles (mostly on proper names)
For example, "procura no [motor] Google" (masculine) vs "trabalho na [empresa] Google" (feminine)
Yes, in Portuguese we usually know by the way the word ends which is the correct articles
The problems are with foreign words
Nowadays, the biggest problem we have is if we either use masculine or feminine to refer to covid
Most people say "O covid" but I think "A covid" makes more sense
It sounds worse though
It's a bit tricky
for words in Portuguese it's easy to know which article to use by the word ending
for foreign words, we go by the general vibe
Sometimes the same word has a different gender depending on the dialect of Portuguese
For example, sandwich is masculine in pt-br but feminine in all other variants of Portuguese
See in portuguese it easy, nutella ends with an 'a' therefore it is female
Other words might not be this easy
Yeah, you could think of "O vírus covid", but I could see arguments for "A pandemia covid", so I guess both work
Weirdos
Same with Portuguese
O Nutella just sounds weird
I've heard from a friend who is a biologist that if we say sars-covid it's male because that's the virus
If you want to say the disease, it's female because it's a disease
It makes some sense, but still
Specially because it ends with an a :)
*spelling
In Portugal that happens too but with brazilian shows and movies
It’s almost a meme here aswell
in here we have some spanish, french, dannish and german tv shows broadcasting through the public channels and cable
We also have a lot of French movies on our cinemas (and also on cable tv) and due to that I am huge fan of Omar Sy
we also tend to adapt some international tv shows like competitions and spannish tv shows
Here in Portugal it's all American and Brazilian and not much European besides some British, Spanish and French
The ones i hate the most: 1) people that think we are part of Spain or some rebel province that got independence
We are older than Spain, we are one of the oldest nations in Europe 1179, and we are one of the most consistent country in Europe
2) we are lazy and just want to drink alcohol and have spend money on working girls (this one was once said by very well known person about the southern European countries), we are not lazy we work really hard
The one i find amusing is: Portuguese people are everywhere around the world, this one is true (fun fact it's famously appears in the Comic Tintin where a Portuguese guy appears everywhere in even in the most uncommon and unexpected places)
Portuguese people are welcoming, absolutely true in general, (there's the occasional ass, but they are everywhere)
Hate: We're part of Spain, them lot didn't exist when we came into being (n they're a bit of a copy cat like with the whole empire ting n what not, not the other way around)
Amusing: we're lazy, I certainly am ngl but everyone else is very hardworking more so than most other people tbh
Hate: that we're all poor fisherman or some other low skill profession
Find amusing: that Portuguese women have an abnormal amount of facial hair in the area above the upper lip
não é 1179 é 1143 quem não sabe esta data não é bom português :p. O tratado de Zamora é que determinou a independência de Portugal, em 1179 foi só o reconhecimento do Papa, se não estou enganado
>Is it common for tourists to think you guys speak Spanish or as you say actually part of Spain
Not that common but not uncommon, and i mean both
>I've heard speaking Spanish as a tourist in Portugal is a big no no
True in general, let me give you a bit of context, it's because of those 2 things you said above that i quoted first, and because it's seen has a bit rude in the sense that you gives the impression that you think we speak Spanish (we naturally understand Spanish although the Spanish cannot understand Portuguese has we can understand them) and because in general portugues people in general speak very well English, and because it gives the impression that you didn't pay enough attention and try to learn a bit of Portuguese simple words even if badly spoken (we appreciate that a lot because it's a sign of respect for us)
But don't get the wrong idea because we don't really care, we just get a bit annoyed nothing more, if its just Spaniard then we don't really care if he speaks Spanish this is more towards people that aren't native Spanish speakers and know how speak English or French (or any other language) better than anything or Spanish
A friend of mine worked near an airport and once got some American lady be shocked that she wasn't in Spain, and was completely unaware that Portuguese was even a thing
Another friend of mine always purposely gives the wrong directions to tourists who ask him in Spanish or say "gracias" (unless they are native Spanish speakers speaking their native language, of course)
Sim, mas Internationalmente é só com o manifestis probatum que Portugal é reconhecido por toda a cristandade o que fez dele oficialmente um país independente ao olhos de toda a cristandade, não basta só um país a reconhecer para ser se país é preciso o reconhecimento de vários e com a manifestis probatum tem isso, é por isso que oficialmente é em 1179 e não em 1143
Apesar de 1143 ser bastante importante na nossa história não é oficialmente o nosso começo aos olhos da comunidade internacional da altura, isso é o mais importante porque assegura vários privilégios poderes de soberania completa e segurança/confiança.
Has to be sunny and above 20ºc. I'm a reptile though, and have incredibly cold hands and feet
Usually 22 or so
But something here is that I am close to the Atlantic so it might be really hot at 2 pm, but it gets really windy and cool on late afternoon, so sometimes you just wear sleeves or something hotter
Also noticeable, in Lisbon we got lots of foreigners living there and you can see tribes
People from clearly cooler places, start wearing shorts and short sleeves much before locals
People from the tropics are wearing their padded coats in May and really wrapped up
around 10°C maybe
most people look a bit surprised though so uh idk maybe like 15-20° is more normal
I'm yet to wear short sleeves this year and I live in Portugal, so yeah
You get the point
Same, if there's Sun out 15ºC is more than enough for me
T-shirt and shorts weather definitely
If it's cloudy/windy I might push with a jacket though
I've never gotten dizzy because of heat
I've never gotten a heatstroke either
I worked a lot with furnaces and I had to be like 1-1
5m away from a fire that would go over 1000ºC sometimes
My resistance to temperature is really high on both ends of the spectrum
I would also finish the night shift at that place with furnaces and go home to take a cold shower at 5am no problem
My condolences for that heat wave
Gotta get some AC in there
And make sure the attic is insulated as well as having white blinds on the windows towards the sun
I started working in 2014 and it was a fucking circus
You didn't have the luxury of choice
Salaries hit rock bottom
You got out of university with a master's degree and were lucky if you got 700€/month
Today things are better, unemployment is the lowest in 17 years, you can negotiate salaries and if you have an IT degree or related you can get an initial offer around 1200€.
The downside is that real estate prices went through the roof
In Lisbon and Porto it's almost impossible to rent or buy if you're alone
Even for couples it's not easy
Winning the Euro 2016 and the Eurovision 2017
I can't really express how much these two events changed the morale around these parts
Also, we went from a right-wing government set on implementing austerity measures to
whatever thing we had the last 4 years
Also, we just had an election and finally a right-wing party made its way into the parliament (although it's a bit of a joke party, not at all what we see elsewhere in Europe)
Other than that, it's the same as always
I almost googled the date of the last UEFA Euro
Like isn't that always on even years
In my mind every EU member has the same currency, except UK
Who is considered a national hero in your country
Someone people in your country still look up to and admire for their deeds
We have:
Viriato - Lusitanian tribe leader who fought the Romans
Brites de Almeida, the baker of Aljubarrota  - after the battle of Aljubarrota, she killed several Castillian soldiers with a shovel
Might have been a myth, but people still admire her
King Afonso Henriques - gave the country indepence from Léon, absolute badass who counquered from the Minho to Lisbon
Vasco da Gama - sea explorer, found the sea route to India
Luís Vaz de Camões - poet, wrote the biggest Portuguese epic poem, the Lusiads
Studied both in Portugal and Brazil
Fernando Pessoa - poet, wrote our best poems in recent literature
Also studied in Brazil
The April Captains - overthrew a 60 year old dictatorship with no bloodshed
Aristides de Sousa Mendes - saved thousands of Jews from the Nazis by allowing them to flee to Portugal
Not to rain on your parade or anything like that but I think I should mention that the Aljubarrota baker’s name is actually Brites de Almeida and she was not a real person
Even though her story is retold lots of times she’s actually a myth
You said it all
OP, how could you forget Aristide de Sousa Mendes
Camões poet that wrote an epic, he save the epic from being destroyed by a shipwreck accident, he was also a soldier, and the day of the nation his also his
>-Vercingétorix: Celtic gaul leader who fought against Julius ceasar
Anyone who's read Astérix knows of him hehe
Also, I wouldn't consider her a national figure on the level of Vasco da Gama, but more of a fun legend
It's not like she had an actual influence on Portuguese history
Oh, right
I'll ad him to list
Terra da fraternidade
From what I read, Franco wanted to conquer Portugal but he didn't get the support from Hitler to do so, he even had a plan to do it in 24 hours
However, Portugal and Spain had the Iberian pact of non agression, and by staying neutral and later  offering support to Britain and the US, Portugal's role was to keep Spain neutral as well
Later, after the Carnation Revolution in 1974, Franco was furious and thought someone would try the same in Spain so he wanted to invaded Portugal again out of fear of the Red Menace
That's why he even tried to convince the United States to help (the CIA did some questionable things here in Portugal after the revolution to "save us" from comunism), but he died next year and then nothing became of it
Agreed
I think we like to tell that story because of our love hate relationship with the Spanish and the thought of a single Portuguese woman beating up seven Spanish guys and putting them in the oven to make pão com chouriço is pretty cool
We suck at land, but the sea was ours
Nowadays, we mostly fight Spanish fishermen though
I'm a bit late to this party but my grandfather was arrested during the revolution of 25th of April in Portugal because he blocked access to weaponry (guns, granades, vehicles, etc etc) from the revolutionaries
I sadly don't know more details because I never met the guy
Oh well
Well I don't think my country has declared itself a Roman empire successor but if I had to say I think the Roman empire had a lot of sucessors in a way
Bruv this is a russain byzantine Italian German thing
Drinking alcohol in the street being socially acceptable and understanding the difference between socialism and social democracy
No I'm speaking of drinking in the street, also there might be law or not depending on where you are and even then they exist they might not be in force because it's socially acceptable
I don't know about Lithuania but from what i heard countries of Latin roots and Germany it's generally acceptable to drink in public in the street
Well from what i know and heard Latin rooted countries and Germany it's socially acceptable to drink in public, so i would that's largely popular
He (like Mandrake and some others) was semi-popular here in Portugal back in the 60s-70s, but not nowadays
You see some English mixed with Portuguese endings
Like speedar (to speed) or speedado (being full of energy/on a rush)
Rapar (to rap, but it can also be read as shave)
Googlar, a Portuguese verb for "Google it
Smoking and lifting we use as well, but a footing is more of hygienic walk
Jogging we just call correr
We here call box to garages in buildings that are individually enclosed spaces (like a box), as opposed to building that have parking lot-type of garages
It's not weed or hash they're selling
It's laurel leaves and bouillon cubes
gas prices
Sometimes taxi cab drivers charge you much more than they should when you start speaking English
It's horrible
Good alternatives: Uber and Lyft
Shmucky restaurants and caffés with no fixed menu (on purpose) will also do that sometimes if you don't speak fluent Portuguese, although it's much less than taxis and getting rarer
Still, beware
Adding to this, sometimes even if you ask to smell it they will burn a tip of the corner that has a little amount of hash, the rest is still a bouillon cube
The German automotive industry still produces some of the best cars on the entire planet, if not the best (I'm not including sports brands like Ferrari, Lambhorghini, McLaren, etc
So people will still buy them
I have a Mercedes for example
It's obviously a urban myth but I don't know how people believe in it
that my first grade teacher would beat and bulli kids with learning problems, like me i have dyslexia, and got away scot free (the school fail doing anything so i would say the education system also fail because of this) (this was in 2005/6)
the stress cause by lack of time for learning everything in the programe
thankfully this problems don't exist in universtity at least not in law school
Schoolbooks are needlessly expensive and frequently changing
Religion is taught on schools
Physical Education teachers are generally awful
I seriously doubt both have much in common these days
Haggis in Ireland
It is delicious
I ate it at breakfast everyday
I feel the same way
Usually dislike cucumber in salads and sandwiches (I just don't like the taste and smell
) but tzatziki is awesome
I actually did, I did find any difference
they were both good ngl
Yes, in every hotel
My trip was Lisbon-Dublin-Liverpool-Manchester-the highlands- Edinburgh-Lisbon
Generally most if not all our flags that we had are liked but there are some people who like certain ones or certain elements, like colour scheme, better
Honestly, the House of Braganza colors really doesn't go with the stars and stripes
We call the palm slap game "sardine game", jogo da sardinha, don't ask me why, no, there's no fish involved, but there's lot of hand slappin'.
I've honestly never had someone ask me to do that
Literally the only phrase I know
We like to say we hate the Spanish, but it's more of a joke
Castile used to be our arch-enemy
Picture this scenario: Sweden conquers all of Scandinavia except Denmark
Then, it changes its name to "Scandinavia" and its Swedish language is now called "Scandinavian". That's what Castile did in Iberia
I can't see Portugal and Republican Spain being enemies at all, because this version of Spain recognizes its heterogenous nature
It's in fact a union of Iberian people
Spain - gieb Olivença back
Not a real issue or grievance but it's legally ours and it would make a hell of a boost in our relations
Brasil - Stop whining about the gold Portugal took while you were a colony and our crown was responsible for the mining operations and control of it
We spent it in church altars and luxury imports, setting our country in a spiral of hand-out culture that to this day still lingers on
It was worst for us than not having so much
Angola - We're tired of your inferiority complex
Everything wrong in your corrupt so called democracy is still our fault
After 45 years of independence
That's verrrry fanny, für a Gerrman
>but it's sometimes considered to be tiny and less important than Spain
If that helps you deal with the trauma of getting your ass kicked every single time you tried to mess with us
But really
Yeah, every single Spanish I met in person and the comments I've seen online, seem to like us
The Spanish are like "We love our Iberian hermanos
". And the Portuguese are like "We're gonna eat them all, caralho
“Tiny”
Bruh
that hurt
In 1940s the Portuguese population organized one of the biggest charity events to help struggling Finland
We gathered enormous amounts of food and clothing
Then, in the crisis of 2009 you shit on us and refused to help us and argued against anyone helping us
Just saying
We have the same problems with Brazil
They speak a very simplified and informal version of Portuguese
Yet, it's the most recognised version and people say it sounds better
I'm not Spanish and I have a problem with it
This is Iberia goddamn it
Wanna go for some Reconquista
I agree in what you say about the borders
Not our fault either
Portugal wasn't listened in the Vienna treaty and just accepted the borders established by it
And that's why I mention Angola and no other former colonies
There are a few ethnic problems in the country but no common hatred as in other African countries
But, Angola has oil, diamonds, gold and agricultural richnesses that other countries in Africa dream of but whenever something happens, there comes the hatred against the former coloniser
We gave them what was rightfully theirs 45 years ago
is it our fault they chose to create a cleptocracy instead of a country where all citizens can reap the richnesses of it
Obviously it is unfortunate
Worst than senile, those people who divided Africa had absolutely no respect for the people that occupied those lands
It's appalling the lack of notion they had that these were human beings, just like they were
Nowadays,  creating a nation for each of the people in Africa would mean creating more than 300 new countries, most of them not viable because they would have no resources, access to water, etc
There is no easy way to solve all the territorial issues in Africa
Let's hope they can work together to solve the problem we europeans left them with
Maybe Coimbra since it also lacks a big football team and it's very far away from the major tourist hotspots (Lisbon, Porto, Algarve)
In Portugal, many of the cities near Lisbon and Porto (as in, part of their metropolitan areas) get overshadowed by them, I guess
You won't hear a foreigner talking about Vila Nova de Gaia, Cascais e Loures, despite the fact that they are all in the top 6 biggest cities
Académica is a fairly big club, just going through a bad phase right now
Brazilians do recognize the name of Coimbra because of the university, I really wouldn't expect non-lusophone foreigners to know our cities names beyond Lisbon or Porto
Coimbra is famous
Braga or Setúbal are a better choice
Padua is know for its univeristy
and in Portugal, also because of St
Anthony
football fans might recognize the name of Maribor
Was going to say the same
Império Austro-Húngaro
Literally the same
We are poor
Although hardworking we are not well organized, I guess we rely too much on our ability to improvise and turn things around
That's common in all of Souther Europe
Portugal is the same
Is fucking annoying
Same in Portugal
I would kill for that over here
Everyone is always late and I cannot stand it
Not quite
There are Chico espertos in Portugal but nothing we love so much as to expose one for that and punish him/her
Italy is a bit different, IMO
It is a bit shocking in a way, literally no shame on some things
Give it a few years, you will one day be celebrating the day you surpass Portugal on the list
To change the constitution here, the law must have at least two thirds of approval on the parliament and the approval of the President
That's the current constitution, though
We've had constitutions for a while longer than the current one, since 1822 I believe
«Esquilo» =  (i)ʃˈkilu
I assume I was supposed to use IPA, otherwise, sounding it out in english, might make it more ambiguous
I'm not aware of foreigners struggling with pronouncing it, but I guess it might ultimately depend on what's their native language
I've never heard a foreigner use the word esquilo tbh
Squirrels aren't really a common subject of discussion here
'shkey-loo, more or less
You are right
Portugal doesn't have a lot of squirrels
They were actually considered extinct until the 1980's when reintroduction started
Still today you will only find them sporadically in some rural areas
For most of the population, dolphins and flamingos are a more common sight than squirrels
It blew my mind when I moved to Germany and there were squirrels living in the middle of cities
First time I saw squirrels was in London
I am from Porto and never saw a squirrel there
'Rata' (singular) is a slang for
huh
lady bits in Portuguese, so there's that
I'd say they're more for people who are having trouble keeping up with certain subjects
At leas that was the case for me
I had a maths tutor because I just so happened to miss the class where they taught us division and ever since I've been a bit behind
When it came to studying for the final exams some teachers had extra study sessions that were optional
I did a few Geometry ones for instance
We'd do exercices and ask the teacher for help if we needed any
Some do, but you can enter the degree you want by studying with relative ease, it's not that competitive
I would say that in Portugal is quite competitive to go to the uni
meh, maybe this year will be competitive, but unless for a few select courses you don't need to have near perfect grades
And in many countries the average dont even count at all
in other countries the selection is after the first year of university or through processes that favor the urban rich
ours is more objective
Our country has higher temperatures, so yes, we keep them in the fridge
Nah
They are good on room temperature, plus they get eaten in like max 3 weeks
Football
Beer
Super Bock (mostly North) vs
Sagres (mostly South)
Those guys in the south really love drinking piss
Is Napoletana the thin one
Aight, I'm a Romana fan I guess
I hate thick soggy pizza
Ao limite eu vou by Non-stop
always always comes up
In Portugal I think the most common one is Minha Casinha by Xutos e Pontapés. Also any fado song like Perfeito Coração by Amália Rodrigues, because we all know the lyrics
Maybe there’s songs from popular singers too like Toy, Marco Paulo, Tony Carreira, etc
But I only been to a karoke twice, so take it with a grain of salt
I've always known it as Dragostea din tei, I don't think anyone called it Numa Numa here
"O homem do leme" and "casinha" are always there 2
"Vaai quem já nada teme, vai o homemmm do leeeemeee eee". It's so ubiquitous that I can't even hear it in my head without it being severely out of tune and/or screamed
Normally 8h or 14h if night train
I do not feel like checking but I do not think Copenhagen-Zurich would fit my rules, but I can imagine doing it in vacation one way
It is not a complicated route
But continuing to Milan would be too long
I would need a break
I lived in Zurich for some time and I would travel to all its neighboring countries by train
Several times I did Zurich-Italian cities by train
Max till Naples
I compare the prices and time of travel to make a decision
So I can't give an fixed answer
Unless you concept of economic spectrum has swung incredibly to the right (common in the last decades) I wouldn't say so
The focus of christian-democracy is still a national organic polity, where the insurance based health care model or co-determination have a role within social concertation
Business leaders, right-wing parties and the right-wing faction of the social-democratic party managed to win the public conversation
By the way [ABBA manifested against it as well]
>When the Swedish Social Democrats proposed the same idea in 1982, the pop group behind “The Winner Takes It All” and “Money, Money, Money” helped lead opposition to the proposal, producing pamphlets and even hosting an open air gig to protest
In the end, ABBA saw off the socialist menace
The idea was watered down by the Swedish government, then scrapped in the 1990s.
I dunno
I can't recall ever seeing Portugal portrayed in a foreign movie
Apparently we're in South America
Russians in the new CoD are literally monsters, i wonder how russians feel about being portraid this way
Big oof
Oh God, that restaurant scene
It's like they placed every single Portuguese stereotype into one room
So true, its ridiculous, i mean, russians did invade afghanistan, but they didnt enslave them ffs, and russia already had women fighting in ww1
And its hillarious that part where a few female prisioners who some have never held weapons simply kill hundreds of trained russian soldiers as they escape
No I can't. Never learned how to
We apologise for the defective model
Please, send her back
We will deal with the problem immediately and send you a new one that can use bicycle
I learned to ride when I was 4-5 years old
Jokes apart,  I don't know if its cultural or just the people around me,  but most girls I know couldn't ride a bicycle to save their lives
I can't, it always surprises people when I tell them lol
well i am also from portugal and I learned at 4 years old
I live in Portugal and as much as I love the country, the use of public space just makes me sad
Every square centimeter is dedicated to cars, urban planning is non-existent and people either go to the gym or get fat at 30
A country where you can bike, run and swim (ocean is 15° in January
) all year, but nobody does
Such amazing nature everywhere and such callous care for it
Things are slowly changing, but it's still a 1970s mentality in many ways
I don't think I know anyone who doesn't know how to ride a bicycle
is not learning how to ride a bicycle a city thing or
Then the kid realizes it and immediately falls because he's looking backwards
> ocean is 15° in January
Dude, get out of here, that's cold as fuck
I'm 29 and don't hit the gym, but I'm still thin
I live in Lisboa
This is a city built on 7 hills
Not very suitable for biking
There were practically no bike lanes in the city until this decade
Nowadays there's some and you see some people biking
Maybe in flatter parts of the country people bike more, dunno
Running in a big city doesn't seem practical
Nobody swims
They do when it's hot
Or they just swim in indoor pools when it's colder
It's very rare to run into someone who can't swim here
I was born and raised in the capital
Lived in Lisboa all my life
I don't care much about nature
Looks pretty in pictures but that's it
> is not learning how to ride a bicycle a city thing or
It definitely factors into it
Not really needing it, because public transportation is good or the fact you live near "everything" and can walk everywhere, plus living in an apartment and not having the space to keep a bike
Add that to non-existent bycicle infrastructure (proper lanes, proper parking spaces and so on) plus Portuguese drivers and roads being a bit on the dangerous side and you have a ton of people who never really saw the benefit of learning how to bike
And then, this is cyclical
If your parents were not also never into biking, then they're not going to push you into it either
By the time you start considering being more mobile and needing to make bigger trips, you're probably nearing 18 and you'll go straight into applying for your driver's license
No idea
I've personally never had a bicycle or saw any desire or need to own one and learn how to ride it
> I'm 29 and don't hit the gym, but I'm still thin
You've got one year to join a gym my friend
> I live in Lisboa

I also live in Lisbon and I bike everywhere
> Running in a big city doesn't seem practical
People run everywhere, in particular in bigger cities
And Lisbon actually has great places to run (river bank, Monsanto, Bela Vista, ...), but almost nobody does
> Nobody swims
They do when it's hot
Or they just swim in indoor pools when it's colder
It's very rare to run into someone who can't swim here
People can swim, but there are very few actual swimmers
I swim all year round in the ocean (with a suit) and I only saw another person once
> I was born and raised in the capital
Loved in Lisboa all my life
I don't care much about nature
Looks pretty in pictures but that's it
I can respect that
I was mainly reacting to the OP, and I was not surprised to read that the girl in the story was Portuguese
It's an outdoor paradise for a people that could not care less about the outdoors
In the Netherlands, where I lived before, there is almost no nature to speak of really and people just make so much of what little they have, it's amazing
And you can really see the effect that has on their body and mind
>You've got one year to join a gym my friend
My brother is close to 40, doesn't exercise and is still thin
So what makes you think I'll get fat
>I also live in Lisbon and I bike everywhere
Good for you, I guess
>People run everywhere, in particular in bigger cities
But Lisbon actually has great places to run (river bank, Monsanto, Bela Vista, ...), but almost nobody does
So what
Let people do whatever they want
>People can swim, but there are very few actual swimmers
I swim all year round in the ocean (with a suit) and I only saw another person once
That type of swimmer you are that requires a suit probably requires you to be a better swimmer than average
Most people aren't gonna be into that
I assume surfers wear similar suits

Paradise
Don't other European countries have that kind of stuff
Hey, half of what I wrote is tongue in cheek
People can run and not run, swim or not swim, but we're often discussing cultural differences on this sub
I don't know if you have every lived in other countries in Europe, but Portugal is a pretty special place
The diversity in nature is staggering and for someone like me, who grew up in a cold and dark place, the opportunities are endless
Swimming in the ocean all year round, it's too amazing to put into words
But yeah, I am often really surprised that people make so little use of the splendor they have been given and I do believe that they would lead happier lives if they'd go out a little more, learn how to bike and leave the car at home sometimes
>Hey, half of what I wrote is tongue in cheek

No I haven't.
14th century discovery (Iberian peninsula)
*a game about the 1980s/90s during the Berlin Wall period, maybe about escaping or the perspective of people when the wall fell what was like
*a game about WW2 telling real stories of people who helped Jews or other minorities escape
*a game about ancient Greece, either a philosophy type strategy card game or about mythology
Sometimes we call Spain "nuestros hermanos" (our brothers)
same for portugal
We call Spaniards "Nuestros hermanos " or "cabroes". Depends on the mood
Started in 1939, ended in 1945
Germany lost
We were not in it, but many refugees fled through here
Lisbon was spy central
The goverment allowed the US and UK air force to land in the Azores
I'd say it's covered pretty extensively
Focuses a lot more on the European Theatre but it does touch on the Pacific Theatre a tad as well
I remember studying the reasons why Germany went to war (Versailles and 'living space' mostly), and how Hitler continuously overreached before the war (Austria and Czechoslovakia), so Poland was the last straw for the Allies
The map that most schools had didn't say "Portugal is the size of Europe" it usually said something along the lines of "Portugal isn't as small as it seems" or something close to that with a map of Europe with our ex-colonies over it, and don't forget the cross that was in most classrooms enforcing the whole supposed connection Portugal had with god that dates since the foundation of Portugal since our first king was carrying out the dream of his father who was a cruzado, if I remember correctly he came to help in the reconquista from france and our first flag comes from that
my dude there are even stories of portuguese kings who allowed muslims to stay even after their cities were conquered
there were no genocides there were only wars
You also said that there were plenty of genocidy stuff going on during the Reconquista which is a lie
Turkey is a bit less common than chicken but nonetheless pretty common
Most typically [with mushroom sauce] or [breaded] And a lot of families eat a whole roasted turkey on Christmas Day
Duck is also quite popular, but almost exclusively in the form of [duck rice]
Partridge, pigeon and quail are a thing, but not a thing most people have tried, especially in urban areas
I've never heard of eating goose here
In Portugal the two more common are duck (specially [on rice] and quail (I think grilled whole), as part of the traditional food
I think I've eaten pigeon, but only once and not in a restaurant, so am unsure if that's a thing
And there was a time in which ostrich farms could be found frequently in mainland Portugal, but it isn't part of traditional cuisine and I don't think it ever became mainstream
Besides Chicken, the most common you can find in Supermarkets/Butchers would be Turkey (very common, but less so than chicken), and then Duck
Quail and Partridge(Perdiz) are not unknown, but TBH I never saw them for sale
Duck rice,  is one of of our most popular traditional dishes
I think most supermarkets sell duck, and further some sell packages with the deboned duck in strips and a container of the duck broth so people can make their own homemade duck rice
Other than that in trendier, more modern restaurants, duck can be on other dishes like brás-style or duck magret or other duck dishes
Turkey is very very common, lots of school meals with it
Pigeon is relatively popular specially for pigeon canja (like congee) and sometimes can be found
Quail also
Goose is very rare
Partridge is a traditional gourmet food here, it is very rare to find it on supermarkets, might be found on some high end traditional restaurants occasionally (empada de perdiz, perdiz à convento de Alcântara)
Hunters might eat a few more birds, like pheasants or galinhola, wild duck, a few others
> ostrich
Man, I miss ostrich steaks
Those were so gooood
It's really good
Duck rice is that universal dish
If you don't know what  your guests like or what to serve, serve duck rice
Almost everyone likes duck rice
If you ask any Portuguese at random, a likely answer would be Barreiro
It's an industrial town and has some soviet architecture like buildings
It kinda looks like *those* places from eastern Europe
But, as it goes for most things in Portugal, the weather and the nature kind of makes it more tolerable
Here's a few pictures: [1] [2] [3]
I've seen videos and photographs of Norilisk, and while I'd never actually want to live there it looks fascinating
I would love to be able to visit it someday
Basically the entire Margem Sul (and I'm from there)
Not really, Barreiro is the worst
You have nice places by the beach
Also montijo is getting better
Cacém is also ugly as f... thousands getting away from war in Africa let's put them all in the same place
Yes, when you put it in perspective with other entries on this thread, it's not that bad indeed
It's still pretty bad for Portugal standards
There are many reasons for disliking living in Portugal
At least being an ugly place isn't one of them, I guess
This area was almost entirely built during the 70s, when there was a communist counter-revolution
This used to be an industrial area
Then they built a lot of these awful flats surrounding the now abandoned factories
A common sight in these areas are brick chimneys with nothing else
Ah Cacém... Cacém is Barreiro's brother
I find it even worst because it's claustrophobic -- too many people living in one place
I dread driving through Cacém.
There are some good places, but most of Almada and Seixal are very ugly, even though its getting better every year
Its all the same 70's buildings
I always say that Barreiro is the southern Cacém.
As things are going in terms of rents around Lisbon, I wouldn't mind ownig a flat in one of those 70's buildings in Seixal or Almada
I wouldn't mind at all
And now, with all the construction, Cascais is Cacém Maritima
I have quite a northern accent that most of the country really enjoys mocking
Besides people from Azores island, mine is probably the most funny
Also the frequency we use bad words like "foda-se" or "caralho" helps a lot
Yes because I have a strong accent from Algarve and sometimes I say an expression/word that it doesnt exist in the normal language like - mõh té diebbb; almareado; alcagoita; moçe....
Continental Portugal makes fun of accents from the islands of Madeira and azores
When they try to imitate the accent from Madeira, they unknowingly do the accent from azores which are totally different
Even in the tiny island of Madeira, there’s at least 3 micro accents
Not really
I do remember that when I worked as a waiter and would speak English that I'd tone down my accent and eventually just speak with a Portuguese one because I got tired of everyone asking about my life story
Ok só nessa frase meteste aí uns 3 dialetos diferentes do norte do país. Na zona de Viseu dizem "ejemplo", em trás os montes acentuam um bocado os "r" como em "rrresto" e o trocar v por b é comum no porto e Minho, como dizer "baca". Mas nós acentuamos mais as vogais que no sul do país, por isso "els falm" é algo que muito provavelmente não ouvirias no norte, seria mais algo do género "eles faloum".
Viseu não é norte
German people know how to pronounce *loch* correctly
Just a quick question is there some general anxiety in the Netherlands because of the way you have land
Or do most people don't really care about the possibility of the water rising
Há, meaning either "there is" or "ago", and à, roughly "to the".
besides the à/há, also insane when people use the grave diacritic on words other than à or its derivatives (àquela, às)
also hádes instead of hás-de
a common mistake in common language is to regularize Haver de into a single verb HADER  and say
"to the" is indeed what makes most sense as "à" means "a a" (which is contracted to "à"), where the first "a" means "to", and the second means "the".
Adding to this, people who say things like "fizes te" instead of "fizeste".
One typical of my neck of the woods: failing to adjust for number when using "a gente" (ex: using "a gente vamos" instead of "a gente vai")
For the not portuguese savvy: in the south of Portugal (and in Brazil too, I guess), it's common to use "a gente" (which roughly means "the people") where you would use "nós" ("we")
This makes the verb switch from its 1st person plural conjugation to its 3rd person singular form, but many people skip that part
Yeah, and thanks for clarifying that for other people reading, I said "roughly" because prepositions never really correspond one to one in different languages, e.g. "à tarde" isn't "to the afternoon" but "in the afternoon".
Speaking of which, people who say "fizestes" instead of "fizeste".
I'm from the Center and we use "a gente" sometimes as well
And it's different in European Portuguese actually, we use "Porque é que" for your "Por que" in questions for instance
I get the feeling PT-BR is more complicated there
Yeah, I didn't mean that it is unheard of further north: it's just that it's *way* more common in the south
And in Portugal as well, sadly
I was blown away
Even though I had seen NY in some many shows and movies and knew what to expect, actually being there was amazing
It really did feel like being in a concrete jungle
I only got to see Manhattan (and even then there was a lot I didn't explore), but loved it
It's definitely a place I'd like to go back to one day, and hopefully I'll get to explore the other boroughs too
The only thing that didn't impress me that much was the subway
Made me appreciate the metro in Lisbon a lot more
Didn't know Fallout 3 had such High Res RTX mods
Though breaks immersion for trying to hard to look derelict
Same in Portugal, idk the reason why
The reason is because she's from hawaii (havaí) so "haVaiana".
No, never
*knocks on wood*
Hopefully it will never happen
I was groped by a another classmate for several months when I was 14
I was told to just ignore it since we were both girls and she was just messing around, despite how many times I asked her to stop and explained that she was hurting me
One day I finally punched her in the face, that made her stop
My mom's car radio was stolen 4 times, and they also broke all her windows
I got in a fight in a club
My friends say it wasn't my fault, it was the other dude who hit me first for no reason
I was too drunk to remember
If that's true, it's technically violence
This is the maximum guilty pleasure
It's a kind of music made for older generations with funny lyrics
but it's so much guilty pleasure that's acceptable to play at any party
I strongly recommend that you translate de lyric
[Parte-me o Pescoço] by Agir
Agir is a really cringey rapper/singer, and is the son of a telenovela actress and Portuguese singer/composer
Most of his music seems designed to be catchy and radio friendly, and so it sounds very artificial and manufactured
But *Parte-me o Pescoço* is a legitimate bop
We used to play it ironically at our uni parties/dinners, but I genuinely think it's a fun track to listen to
The [lyrics are stupid but catchy] and I remember one time going to NOS Alive festival and he was the starting act on the main stage
He gave a good show and it was a fun time
Ah, Amy Leeanius, great Lithuanian singer
They exist, but they're not common in Portugal
Windows that open by sliding horizontally are the most common
oscilobatente
I don´t think they are super duper advanced windows, but they are the norm now for newly installed windows
The seal is a lot better which improves thermal and sound insulation
You may have those big tech companies, but we invest our money where it really matters
They exist, they're just more expensive than sliding windows, which are more common
Plus, they don't work when you want double windows (not double-pane), because we all have roller shutters here
> They exist, but they're not common in Portugal
Windows that open by sliding horizontally are the most common
Yeah, I think I only started seeing these here in Portugal about 10 years or so ago
They are becoming more common, though
Pretty much every new building or renovated house will have these nowadays
Portuguese YouTube is probably the worst of thing on the internet
I am from Portugal and there are lots of portuguese youtubers that I like, but for me these three are the best: RicFazeres, Tji, Morais
RicFazeres does gameplay and vlogging comedical videos
His videos are aimed at younger audiences, though I would say that even adults can enjoy his content
He is a very good youtuber and a good person
Here is his channel's link:
Tji does podcasts and storytimes, where he talks about his stories and experiences
His videos are aimed at older audiences, most precisely at young adults, I would say
He also does music too
Here is his channel's link:
Morais does podcasts, reacts and interviews and he is really funny
Morais usually doesn't really make YouTube videos, he does streams, but his streams are on youtube
His videos are aimed to late teenagers/young adults
Here is his channel's link:
For the life of me, I actually can't remember any Portuguese Youtuber that isn't utter trash
If anyone know any interesting one please say so, since from what I've seen Portugal has a definite lack of quality ahah
Dude u have pewds, wtf
Rui Unas
Well, we used to have people like Miguel Luz
Check out Bernardo Bacalhau, he's a refreshing travel filmmaker
Remedy e CCVilhena
I used to like Cager On Two Wheels back when he started the channel and was sharing his experience learning to ride and giving tips to new riders
As expected his growth as a rider stagnated as he learned most of what there's to learn and his content became a narrated streetview trip
Like a TV series that just keeps going when it should've ended 5 seasons ago
CarOnlineTV is another one that I think it's good but I've only seen a few videos since I'm not that much into the topic
I used to watch sexy funny kitchen, they were funny and did great recipes, but then they broke up it changed a bit and i don’t watch it anymore
I'm glad you remained sane
Well yeah, but YouTube is not his main source, he didn't started there u know
I remembered Diogo bataguas now, he's probably my favourite atm but I don't if he started with YouTube, probably not
True, he still does some interesting things like his podcast "janela aberta" but he also kinda abandoned YouTube
Will do
Deadd
I think basically the same, mostly aimed at lil kids but there's also some funny/good ones
They're s much bigger country with a consequent bigger influence so they have more Diversity ig
Who
Tens aqui um aviso /u/ForeverJamon, deixar ir o gato e lá se vai a tua fan-base
Ok, i guess he doesnt like pewds, thats weird, he's the best imo
I know what you mean
"Pure" YouTubers
If we think like that, there is really not much to go into
Not really, Remedy is doing livestreams consistently and uploading highlights on YouTube while uploading random videos every now and then
CCVilhena, while he hasn't posted un 2 months has finished his best ever series that made him triple his subs and really puy his name out there
Also there's RicFazeres, while for a more childish audience is still a youtuber that uploads regularly and it's good, you simply can't deny that from Riczão.
There's also Feromonas, while not consistent anymore I know he'll comeback to take his number 1 spot from that SirKazzio guy (well by that time either D4rk or Wuant will already be there I guess)
Exactly my point though, pure portuguese YouTube is shit (kazzio, numeiro, merdas assim)
All dead channels with no views whatsoever for some reason
CCVilhena has in his 5 previous videos, 1 above a million, 3 above 500k and 1 just reaching 500k. He hasn't posted in 2 months but that's because of the aftermath of his success documentary
RicFazeres on the other hand uploads 2/3 times a day, still gets from 15k to 80k views on a bad month for him since kids are restarting school again, for a country like ours even 50k should be considered a good number since we have old population
EDIT: Remedy still averages 10 to 30k and is uploading every week
Feromonas while not uploading for 2 months and averaging 15k views (sad noises) still has the power to make big comeback since he teasered a comeback of his best series (and best ever portuguese series in terms of Minecraft) and got 300k, for a "dead" youtuber on the other side of the world isn't bad huh
I honestly never heard of Vilhena but the other ones, man that's dead
The portuguese language on YouTube has a lot of viewers thanks to Brazil
15k views is not awful, at least they're still getting views and doing what they love, but that isn't a lot of views
Yes
It's the standard
We start doing that when we're kids/teens
It's common, but it's more common for men who already know each other to pair it with a back pat
Dogs definitely
I find cats incredibly boring
Nationally I think the sentiment is towards dogs as well, but I'm not sure how it is in big cities
Galician-Portuguese hasn't been a language for at least 700 years bro
In Portugal there is [Mirandese]
> The Mirandese language (...) is an Astur-Leonese language or language variety that is sparsely spoken in a small area of northeastern Portugal in the municipalities of Miranda do Douro, Mogadouro and Vimioso
> Mirandese is a descendant of the Astur-Leonese variety spoken in the Kingdom of León and has both archaisms and innovations that differentiate it from the modern varieties of Astur-Leonese spoken in Spain
In recognition of these differences, and due to its political isolation from the rest of the Astur-Leonese speaking territory, Mirandese has adopted a different written norm to the one used in Spain for Astur-Leonese
Lexically, it shares a lot of vocabulary with Portuguese
The most famous cultural thing about the people from the region where this language is spoken is the [Pauliteiros de Miranda]
There is only one other language in Portugal, it’s the only other official language and you’ve never heard of it:
Mirandés
It’s spoken in one village in the north, it’s a hybrid of old portuguese and old castillan, and sounds somewhere between spanish galician and portuguese (with a northern accent)
Well there's Mirandese which is spoken by like 15k people
Some corrections:
There are a couple other minority languages: Minderico and Barranqueno are/were spoken in Minde and Barrancos but are almost extinct
Portugal has three official languages: Portuguese, Mirandese and Portuguese Sign Language
Mirandese is spoken in a region, Miranda do Douro, not a village
It is not a hybrid of Portuguese and Old Castilian, but a descendent of a third Iberian branch of romance languages: Astur-Leonese, that somewhat formed a continuum between Galician-Portuguese and Castilian
It does sounds like what you described, but then again, so does Galician and Leonese (albeit with different ratios of "Portuguese" and "Castillian")
>All these languages developed due to the isolation during the moorish conquer and later Reconquista of the Peninsula in the middle ages
Well, except Basque, which, as you correctly pointed out, is an pre-indoeuropean language, so it had to already exist in some form way before the Islamic period
No prob, they're still extremely similar to this day
Sometimes is easier to understand Galicians than to understand Brazilians
But it all comes to being acquainted more to one or the other
[Amorim]
World largest producer of cork products
Household name here in Portugal, mostly unknown outside
If you have something, whatever, made from cork, there a 80% chance that it came from Portugal
From wine stoppers to spacecraft insulation,  Amorim makes it all
Yes because bus schedules are incompatible with the hours i need to be in university and after a certain hour the bus ceases to perform the route that i need
On a positive note i only drive until the metro station (still far, its in the next town, but at least i don't have to endure the nightmare that's entering Lisbon with a car also more environmental friendly)
Its shame because if the schedule at uni was the same has last year i could have only use the bus and metro to move
Other than getting to Lisbon i depend on car
It's pretty much impossible to move around without a car here where I live
I live in the outskirts of Porto, and here I live there's only 2 bus lines that service my small town with buses every half an hour, and it only goes to Porto, and only covers the main road in my town so you have to have a car, if not you can't even go to a supermarket
Well, yes
Everyday I go to work, if it's not misty or super cloudy, I get to see the Palace of Sintra and the castle of Lisbon from the bridge I cross
Also the ruins of Carmo, from the 18th century earthquake are very visible, because they're on a hill
There are also centuries hold restaurants, stores, etc
It's not very unusual
I have a childhood memory of always passing through a 18th century aqueduct when going to the beach, the aqueduto das águas livres, in Lisbon
Oh that and the fact that my city's local park used to be a royal palace, I think, some sort of solar
Plus in most major cities there is the historical castle, which many times has become some sort of museum like the castle of Gimarães, where the first king of Portugal was born, and can have something like a café.
But it's not like there are artifacts in my backyard, I live in a rather recent part of my city, and tbh I don't have a backyard
But yes, if you do at least a bit of travel across the country you'll find relics of the past, good thing covid hit the tourist business(if we ignore it is a major part of Portugal's revenue), I fear the violation of many city's scenery just to build buildings for touristic leasure, like hotels
My town of Mértola (in Southern Portugal) is pretty much the poster-town for this kind of thing, and archeology is kind of a big thing here
I didn't find anything digging in my backyard, but there's a real possibility that I would, if I did
You pretty much find something of historical value every time that you dig a hole here
Just last year, some Iron Age artifacts (mainly burial urns, but also jewelry, if I'm not mistaken) were unburied 50m or so from my door (there's a small video about it [here] but I can remember such things as a [6th century mausoleum being found beneath our main street while changing pipes] [roman statues being found while renovating an house] (there's also a Roman museum underneath the Town Hall, built around the ruins of a Roman house that were found there) or a skeleton being found in my high school during a routine pipe replacement (not as much of a surprise when you know that my school had an actual Roman burial ground smack in the middle of it, unburied and musealized)
And all the archeological findings started, fittingly enough for this thread, with the person who would become the founder of our Archeological Camp realizing that there were fragments of Islamic-era pottery amongst the rubble stored in some grounds near the castle
Those grounds would later prove to be on top of an entire Islamic neighbourhood, various roman ruins (including a cryptoportico and reasonably well preserved mosaics) and not one, but two early christian baptisteriums
So, yeah, some places (like my town) are really kind of crazy in that regard
Ah yes, the ancient *Via Subterranea*.
Almost nothing, really
I had thought about this and I find it very concerning
I don't know how it is for other countries, but in Portugal, more than 90% of adopted legislation comes from the EU
Yet, almost no-one votes for EU parliament
I think for most people the EU is where the "orders" come from and where "money comes and goes".  Not much else
It's very concerning for me that people are mildly aware that the EU has the "last word" in many important matters and yet they don't know that it's actually democratic and quite transparent, nor do they care
I think a extensive program to inform EU citizens and incentivise their participation in EU matters is as important, if not more, than the development of the institutions
We have a paragraph on our history books that mentions it after the second world war chapter so yeah
I don't know if this an age thing or a different teachers thing or something else
But when I finished secondary school in 2011
I had learned quite a lot about the EU in school
Mostly Geography and History classes  but also Law classes (year 12)
I remember learning about the European parliament and how the EU was structured and organised and different treaties (like Maastricht) and so on
At University, the majority of information was regarding Erasmus+ study and internship programme
I ended up doing an Erasmus+ Internship in the UK myself
I seem to remember that lots of the conference and seminars related to University research projects was also funded by EU projects
So I think I might be more informed than most on that front but I do agree with what you said about general public perception in Portugal
I'll be talking about the Porto area, I don't know if things down south differ that much
For buses you usually pay with cash and the subways you buy the ticket in the stations with either cash or card
Right now I have a card for which I pay 16 euros monthly, that allows me to go anywhere in the greater Porto area how many times I want
The card is valid for the subway and a few bus companies
The card is actually 40 euros/month (still not a lot) but it's cheaper for students that applied for a scholarship
I pay monthly cuz I go to school everyday, and I pay like 60-70€ cuz I live 50km from school (1h and 30 min), and like, I prefer paying monthly cuz if I paid everyday I would be paying per month around 285,2€
In Portugal I've heard "banana" and "whisky" mostly
Some photographers sometimes say sth like "look at the little bird
" when taking a photo
It's funny
I don't think there's a standard phrase that's widely used by everyone, some people I know say "batata frita" (french fry), for instance
Many people don't use any go-to phrase at all
Sometimes we just flat out say it as in english (cheese), sometimes we also say banana or something similar
My dad used to say “fromage” just for fun xd
In Portugal we have a similar one "olha o passarinho" = "look, the birdie"
Some people say “Olhó passarinho
”, but nowadays I guess its not that common
Some people simply say "sorri
" (smile
Do they say "cheese" in English, or do they say "fromage"?
Yeah, where I live “sorri
” is the most used one
Here's what I've had happening to me: a nice couple helped me find my hotel in English, and then asked me where I was from
I said Portugal
And then, they started to talk about when they visited Portugal and so on, all in Spanish
A tour guide was fallowing me and trying to sell me a tour
He was going like "Bon giorno
Italian
French
Spanish
Como estás?" At this point I was like "Hell no
". "Then what
Portuguese
Ronaldo, Ronaldo
" He was fallowing me in the streets of Vienna screaming Ronaldo
This is actually quite common
Many people seem to think that saying "Ronaldo" to a Portuguese is like saying "psss psss" to a cat
I relate with this statement on a spiritual level
" Ah
Portugal
South of Spain
Very nice
Happened to me in London
The Ronaldo crap happens all over the world but Turkey and Tunisia was the worst
Argh
The "Ronaldo
" when they discover you're Portuguese is so true it hurts
I had the "pssss psss" in USA
A security in the UN
I told him how could he
His boss should be his Portuguese reference
A long time ago, before Ronaldo in Tunisia they told me Madjer, eh, Madjer
Same here, "Elisabete II, Rainha de Inglaterra".
Wrong, he meant the Oktoberfest
Nice, but r/giraffesdontexist
Portugal is the #1 producer and exporter of bicycles in Europe
7 million bikes in 2019 :)
We have the oldest active navy in the world, founded in 1317
We sailed to India and China on small sized vessels through unchartered regions of the planet about 500 years ago, so we didn’t have to deal with them pesky middle eastern islamic empires when traveling on the road
Never heard of ;)
At least you are not alone
I sure loved Vienna when I was there, and I miss it a lot
Care to explain the "most drunk man ever"? Like highest level of alchool in blood before dying
Most beers/alchoolic beverage drank in a certain time
Holland and Denmark don't make their own bikes
You did
Probably overseas territories
Bring on the rice and pasta
We would cook rice
In Portugal, other than football and it's variants (futsal, beach football), only handball and roller hockey have a national impact
However, it's rare that they go violent outside the field
Here in Portugal there have been a couple of small isolated violent incidents related to basketball games and rink hockey (or roller hockey) games
But the thing is, those incidents are also mostly due to soccer rivalries, because here in Portugal the organization of sport entities is a bit different than it is in the United States for example, so while for example in the US you might have an American Football Team and a NBA team in the same town but they have nothing to do with each other on the organization level, here in Portugal the most common organization structure is that you will have a Sports Club in a town, and then that Sports Club has a soccer team, and a basketball team, and a rink hockey team, and so on, and all those teams are identified by the name of the club
So you can have two clubs that are soccer rivals and that rivalry carries over to all the other sports, and sometimes people will show up for games of those other sports even if they don´t care that much about them just because their club is playing
Call it soccer again and you will see me turn violent
Rugby is also quite popular, at least in Lisbon
I'm from the North and whilst I regularly watch rugby matches, there is only a few others that watch
Portugal, Spain, France and Italy would be in charge of the food and wouldn't let anyone else get near it
Especially the British
Portugal probably eating and sharing cooked sardines and bacalhau to everyone, sharing its porto and green wine, having a conversation (fun and friendly with a lot swear words) with the other romance countries and then having a nice chat with England about the good old times of kicking Spain and France
During a scientific discussion Portugal would try to demonstrate the many ways that Cork wood can be used and the benefits (we produce Cork wood wallets, motor bike helmets with Cork wood, Cork wood shoes etc
At the end Portugal would have drank more wine than any other country and would only be a little bit drunk (happy drunk)
we would arrive one hour late
We whould try and get something while no one is watching because there is another discussion
The Swiss are absolute mad lads, they eat dinner at 18
As it is supposed to be
At least we'll eat something more than Apéros
I Europe yes, but not at home
Oh, of course, there'd be huge discussions amongst ourselves, especially when trying to decide whose bottle of wine to open
Fair enough, they can join us
Between those 4 countries, there'd be enough shouting in kitchen as it is
Don't put juice in the oven
At what time do you have lunch
And what is considered to be a regular work schedule (like 9-18)
Mad lads
In Portugal, dinner is typically at 20 or 21
Looks like someone needs help
Sadly this time its not with the french so syke
Nah, we would never waste wine
We'd save it and give it to someone else in the next party
I learned that the portuguese were the first christians to reach Japan and to get kicked out of it, and nowadays in Nagasaki ( I think) they celebrate our short presence there
I also learned that the fried shrimp that you find in almost every japanese restaurant in europe was originally a portuguese recipe that was made with a vegetable
Interesante
Breaking Bad
Margem Sul and Alentejo would be the perfect spots
Also, House of Cards would be really cool, considering the amount of corruption our government has
Going more to the comedy side, a show like the Office but Portuguese would be incredible comedic material
ahah I like this, and might add a game of thrones like show about the age of discovery showing the sailors and their interaction with natives around the world
The Belgian government coalition deals are enough for a complete series with movies, spin-offs, prequels,  sequels, you name it
Drugs are legal here
(They're decriminalized)
Portuguese borders are the oldest in the world
(Last changed 20 years ago)
Portuguese police is incompetent and corrupt
(Brought whenever the Madeline McCann case is discussed, truth is it could have been handled better but it's far from being an inept force)
Pastel de Belém is not a Pastel de Nata (Simply wrong, just look and taste them)
Several
The most popular in some circles is that Portugal legalized all drugs, or that real drugs are easy to obtain (condiments are) and that is a proof of something and legalize all drugs and so on
Foreigners really have a difficult time grasping that depenalizing drug consumption was not meant to make it easier for consumers to consume and that everything else, including buying, selling and producing is ilegal and a crime
It probably ruins their agenda anyway
The no net neutrality in Portugal
Ffs
smaller, but Portugal really is not on the mediterranean and is not actually much of a mediterranean country
Food and weather maybe (but not quite
foreigners do not expect the wind or cold water)
You would think this would be trivial, but I just bet in 10 minutes of me posting this, somebody foreigner is going to post "but actually"....
Cute fact of the week
>Pastel de Belém is not a Pastel de Nata
Não queres dizer ao contrário
A minha ideia é que o pastel de Belém é um tipo de pastel de nata (específico de Belém)
“Only” 5k lol that’s still a ridiculous amount to pay
"But have you seen Portugal ISP's packages
The ones that were declared illegal by ANACOM
(Portuguese FCC)
I'm not finding a lot about a border change 20 years ago (maybe someone else can also clarify me on that)
But basically, we have a very old border with Spain (the treaty that officially established our borders was signed in 1297)
However, there have been a number of minor border changes between the two countries throughout the 7 following centuries
For example, Olivença/Olivenza was illegally anexed by Spain in 1801
Note that the border changes are all very minor
It's not entirely correct to stay it's the oldest non-changed border in the world, but it's not entirely dishonest either
Probably Macau being handed over back to China in 1999
I scared them off by telling them I awaited them but they could not resist, they are out now
I think they were trying to answer to [this] post by OP
Right
At some point one might consider dying, it should be cheaper
>Not for an American
Nah mate, no matter where you are if you have to pay 5k to get yourself healthy/fixed it’s a ridiculous amount
Even the fact that someone is charged with that value is ridiculous
But to able not to pay for the medical bills you have to go through applications to see if you’re in fact eligible and after that if you still don’t pay the bills it can eventually go to debt collection and affect your credit
That doesn’t seem that simple
Why are you advocating for it then
Because with that answer it doesn’t make any sense for to say “it’s simple if you can’t afford don’t pay it”
I do understand the cost of things thank you very much, and getting charged 5k is ridiculous
Everywhere else in the EU I can have a medical treatment and not pay those kind of figures
Not to mention OP did say something about the original bill being 100k and that is beyond ridiculous that’s just ludicrous
Care to elaborate then
Why is it that I can go to the hospital for all sorts of things and come back with a bill that’s not even close to 5k? Or why is it that I can call for an ambulance and not pay 1k for it
Are we all wrong about the cost of things and only the all mighty USA is right
Or are you so deeply misinformed that you actually believe the crap you say
Yes you can do that with insurance
Without insurance the medical bills are so high people actually get a big debt, that requires them to fill up forms after forms just to be eligible not to pay
And as I’ve said if it turns out that they’re not eligible to pay, the bills eventually go into debt collection
Well not every injury happens when people are at work right
So that’s a special case, an exception if you may
I’ve been to the hospital a few times unfortunately, due to sports injuries and I never payed even close to 400€, so even that it’s a big amount to pay
Here if I go into the hospital let’s say with an appendicitis I will pay 80€ max
>Got an EKG and some other tests and it was 400$ total
Now am I imagining things or did your actually write this
You were charged with it, if you’re insured you probably won’t pay but everyone else that isn’t will eventually have to
Is that so hard to understand
Either you really are misinformed or all of [these] are wrong
There’s even a [study] on medical bills and how they affect people, if you don’t have the patience to read you can always read [this] that says that someone who is uninsured and has medical bills doubles his chances of filing for bankruptcy over the next four years
Or even [this] describing in detail how to figure out how to pay for said medical bills
>How are you this confused
Really
Well let’s see because up until now I have provided you with articles, studies and general knowledge about the subject while you failed to provide a single argument good enough to prove me wrong
Even a fellow American citizen u/100dylan99 (sorry to bring you into this mate) has confirmed about his family going bankrupt over medical bills
Yet all you have to answer is “no”, “you’re wrong” and “you don’t understand the cost of things” while failing to provide something that would confirm it
It’s like taking to a broken record that has nothing else to say except all of those things
Carlos Cruz
~~EDIT: Portugal btw, I haven't set up my flag yet
Hmm
maybe he was the most famous person but the best story imo is the myth Tomás Taveira
When I was little my siblings loved Eminem and my favorite song of his was "Stan". I'm not really I to hip-hop so I did hear the song for a long time, and when I did I was shocked with what be said
Also [Shaggy - It wasn't me]
It’s not a tradition but it exists
I’ve been to summer camps when I was younger
My lil cousin is in one now
I don't believe so
At least I've never been sent to one
Seems like an American thing
Usually every 6 months to a year, depends on the teeth and the teeth doctor, I go in once a year, my brother twice, that is recommended but last year I didn't go and this year I might go
In Portugal oral health, in general, is not covered by national health system
And not everyone have a private dental health plan
I visit the dentist 2 times a year, conscious that this type of profilatic care, is much more cheap that the potencial treatments if I neglect my oral health
That is not very comom, most people go to the dentist once a year, or only if they have problems
Mostly for budget reasons
I go very rarely, I've gone to the dentist for 5 years, now I go from year to year, but I'm careful
I brush my teeth every day and floss, mouthwash, etc
I was surprised that most of our most famous battles against Castille aren't taught in Spain, like the battle of Aljubarrota
Also the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance, through the Treaty of Windsor, it's ramifications and the fact that it's still active
This one I'm not sure if it is taught outside Portugal and, possibly, the UK
What about France's history
Did you focus more on them
Abolished for political crimes: 1852
Abolished for civil crimes, except treason during wars: 1867
Abolished for all crimes: 1911
Allowed again for treason during wars against another country if committed in the theater of war: 1917
Abolished for all crimes again: 1976
Capital punishment in Portugal was first abolished in 1867 for civil crimes
Portugal was the first country in the world to begin the process to abolish death penalty
It was carried out in stages: for political crimes in 1852, for all crimes (except military) in 1867, and for all crimes in 1911
However, in 1916, death penalty was reinstated only for military crimes committed in the theatre of war against another country
This was abolished again in 1976
Despite military death penalty being legal from 1911 to 1976 for military crimes, only one soldier was executed (in 1917), although the reason for it is unknown
The last civil execution in Portugal took place in Lagos in 1846
In Portugal the death penalty was abolished in 1867 for non military crimes except treason, following the Grand Duchy of Toscana
There was a movement that thought that the abolishing the death penalty would give a great civilizational advantage to the Kingdom
I'm with them
It was a long time ago, it is not really in our consciousness any more
About a reversal being talked, just the most populist right wing politician who tries every hot topic they (his puppet string pullers) can think of, to see what sticks
It has no pull, it is very ludicrous to even think of it, of justice officials duly picking up somebody and taking them somewhere to be officially killed by somebody else
And yeah, somebody gets paid to kill somebody officially
It is unimaginable
I remember, after the Portuguese revolution, in 1975 the execution of Garmendia and Otaegui
I was 9 years old and was completely horrified
In Portugal as soon as they try to socialize and be polite to the natives they will be well treated, there is always some exceptions sometimes but large majority of portuguese people are tolerant to foreigners, no matter where they came from
The ones that try to impose their own traditions,  look to make friendship just with people from the same country or religion or get esely offended will not have the same luck
Don't tell me that you're still mad about the siege of Vienna
Well I didn't notice that much racism and I know a lot of people from Angola or Guinea, at least in the North of Portugal, maybe in places where African community's are bigger things are different but like I said before people here don't deal that well when people try to integrate themselves just with people with the same origin, race or religion
I just can tell you about the places I know better, in my city the black people, at least the ones I know seem well integrated in society, or course there is always some idiots with racist thoughts but is bit rare and usually people are against these thoughts
I didn't know that
I assumed it was the Spanish who did that
Since your Austria and Spain were best friends in those centuries
Our holidays always stay on their dates, regardless
*looks at where I am right now*
No :(
1st May is a day off but this year it was on saturday :/
Yeah and we just had two holidays fall on two weekends in a row
*Sad bacalhau noises* :'(
what you mean 1st May is not a day off
What kind of country is that
1st May is a day off everywhere in the civilized world that respects labour rights
Shit
I shower every single day unless I'm sick or if it's a really cold winter weekend where I don't need to go outside
I usually shower around 5-6 times a week
Taking 3 showers a day is understandable in hot and humid climates but in here in Europe it just sounds like a waste of water to me
Shower everyday most of the year
In summer, more often and I have had 3 showers a day days - I feel a bit guilty about water usage and they are much short showers, almost no soap
But if it it's really hot and muggy and I got to change clothes, just a 2/3 minute shower and maybe more than once a day
In winter it is totally different
In Portugal we shower once a day
I have heard that brazilians say we don't shower, is that true
In Brazil people shower more frequently because of the climate I think
It's that hot and humid weather, which makes you sweat more
We sometimes have that in Portugal during Autumn and Spring
In my region, we call it "Tempo Esquisito".
I do it too, my partner found it so weird that they gave me a pizza cutter for my b-day as a joke
However, I have asked an Italian friend and he said he does it sometimes as well
You can relax knowing that some Italians do it too
Different empire
The sick leaves were kinda permanent, if you get the gist
There are many jokes regarding Alentejanos (people from Alentejo) as lazy people
People also joke about the Azorean (São Miguel island) accent
As to look down, people from Lisbon are regarded as cold/unfriendly (schoking to tourists) by people from other regions
Some people will say Lisbons people feel morally superior to others
The elitism and crentalism of the city kinda makes it happen
Definitely Alentejo
Alenjanos (Alentejo's people) have the stereotype of being really lazy and sleeping all day in the shade  because Alentejo is really hot in the summer
They also have a specific accent
The state of Acre, in Brazil: it doesn't exist
If it does, all you'll find there are dinosaurs and UFOs
In Portugal, people will joke about the region of Alentejo, saying it's a rural wasteland with only ond people and heat
Here in São Miguel we also joke with our accent, specially with people from the town of Rabo de Peixe because they have a very strong accent, even for island standards
"Portugal é Lisboa e o resto é paisagem" já dizia o Eça
This is my favourite sentence about portugal because it is so true
I don't believe that every person in lisbon is rude or whatever but the superiority they feel like they have above the rest of the country is infuriating sometimes
Lisbon is to Portugal as America is to the world ahahah
(((Would still love to live in Lisbon though
Amazing city
)))
Lisbon (2M+) > Oporto (1M+) > Braga (~200k)
Lisbon is the big capital, with the self centered stereotype, rent prices that cost an arm and a leg, and lots of immigrants, specially from Portuguese speaking African countries
It's laid on the river Tagus estuary
Oporto is the North Portugal city of reference, with a lot of regional pride
Its streets are a bit of more grey tone compared with Lisbon, and it's rainier and foggier
It sits where river Douro meets the Atlantic ocean
Braga is the regional capital of Minho, close to Oporto, being significantly smaller than the big 2 Portuguese cities
It has stereotype of being very religious, very rainy (the last one is actually true)
It has a significant population of Brazilians
It doesn't sit close to any significant body of water, as the Este is nothing more than a creek
it's kind of dumb to compare city sizes by using municipal limits
Oporto safely beats Paris and Toronto
but Toronto might be the biggest Azorean city
I'm Portugal vaccines aren't exactly mandatory, but schools won't allow kids to enroll if they don't have their vaccinations checked up
I think the same applies to workplaces
For the ones that have translation yes, like Queen Elizabeth II = Isabel II, however we don’t change the names of Harry or William
I have to say, Kosovo
In Portugal, when there's a really bad situation/happening, people have this saying "It's worse than Kosovo
" or "Looks like Kosovo
" (Idk if anyone says this in other countries in Europe, never heard it)
After visiting Kosovo, I can say that Kosovo is actually pretty nice, and definitely not the worst of the Balkans
My cousin is spending her holidays there right as we speak, says she loves the architecture
Oh beer, how I miss the Netherlands
While working there we had once a month bitterballen and cocktails and every Friday they had Heineken on the fridge of every floor for people to have after lunch
Don’t know if it is normal as it was an IT company and sometimes there is some different cultures between it companies even
Oh I’m not saying this because of the alcohol part itself the point was to be able to pause and grab something and have a conversation with colleagues that normally we would not stop to chat in the busy normal days
From my work experience most companies would do in non-work days events for this and that is something I’m totally against so I miss that other way
P.S. never seen people drunk even with this alcohol available at working hours
Edit: to add the p.s.
Xutos & Pontapés - Contentores -
It's probably the most successful rock band in Portugal and this song it's one of the most popular
It's about drugs and overcoming dependency, but done in a non so evident way
Don't know if you're into doom metal but [Sinistro] is a great portuguese band and it has the twist of having a sweet female voice in this particular song
Here are some recommendations of some rock and metal bands from my country:
Moonspell;
Xutos e Pontapés;
GNR;
(maybe)Capitão Fausto (their hits are leaned more towards pop but they made some rock songs too)
You should also check out Spotify's official playlist of portuguese rock (called "Rock Português)
This song  "Homem do Leme" by Xutos & Pontapés is very beautiful and the opening instrumental sounds like a Portuguese guitar
A Portuguese guitar sounds like this
[A minha casinha] by Xutos & Pontapés
Portugal has some heavy metal culture, mostly on the black metal scene
[Moonspell - Todos os Santos] \- a song about the 1755 earthquake, I mean all this album "1755" is about the earthquake
[Sinistro - Partida]  \- recent doom metal project signed to season of mist, it is really powerfull and groovy
[Bizarra Locomotiva - Mortuário] \- extreme industrial metal band with some really groovy songs, this is their live performance of "Mortuário"
My opinion on some of the worst ones:
**António de Oliveira Salazar** ^((obvs)^)
A fascist dictator that ruled my country with an Iron Fist, limitating freedom of expression and sending thousands upon thousands of young men to Africa to fight in the Colonial War
*Reason of Insanity:* Being obssessed with the overseas territorries and doing ANYTHING to keep them, regardless of the number of Portuguese lives lost
**D. João V**
An absolute monarch who thought he was Louis XIV
Spent almost all the gold from Brazil in parties, wigs and palaces
*Reason of Insanity:* Being crazy and obssessed with imitating The Sun-King and occasionally fucking nuns
How is Salvini so influential
I'm Portuguese, and I don't even know who your PM is
"Casa Pia" case in Portugal
A child sexual abuse scandal that involved many famous people
The sentence came in 2010 and resulted in some arrests of prominent figures
But this story is so complicated and has so many holes that some people still have doubts about whether some people were really involved in it
It is said that the kids were getting paid to accuse specific people in order to end some careers
The abuses were real, but some of the names involved were innocent (some people belive it, others don't)
There's that corruption case involving our ex Prime Minister, José Sócrates
There's the Casa Pia case that was particularly awful
Some men in power abused kids that were in the care of the Casa Pia de Lisboa
There's some corruption situations regarding futebol
There's a taxes corruption case after the Pedrogão wild fires
That deserves a novel
What a story
Dangerous people, I remember the Red Army
In Portugal we had a similar case many years ago, the Revolutionary Brigades that bombed and killed several people
It's an unusual situation in Portugal, big time Portuguese criminals are mostly white collar
Any idea of where someone can watch it with english subtitles
What does being able to mean
A certain amount of income
Debts covered
Above poverty line
3 countries with the biggest stick up their asses in Europe
Always condescending towards the rest of the EU
Not really, we do however say it “differently” depending on the gender
So if you’re a woman you say Obrigada and if you’re a man you say Obrigado
Just to add an explanation on why it happens, "obrigado" (masculine) or "obrigada" (feminine) literally translates into English as "obliged", as in "I'm obliged to you". So, it's a past participle, and in Portuguese, past participles work the same away as adjectives, which vary in gender (meaning, word suffixes differ depending on the gender of the person or object it's referring to)
"Obrigados" does exist
You don't hear it that often but I've heard it several times
Living in Portugal for half a decade and still don't know if I am saying it wrong or not
Thanks for the input
I actually thought about that when commenting but decided not to add it just because our most used word for thank you is obrigado(a), but you’re absolutely correct
Nah, it’s literally “thank you”
It can be both
It can mean obligated or thank you
We have a few words like that, same writing, same pronunciation and different meaning
Yes
I don't know why it became the most common way to thank people in Portuguese, but the way we say "thank you" is pretty much saying we're in debt of that person (sort of "I am *obliged* to repay this favor to you")
The literal translation of "thank you" in Portuguese would be "agradeço-te", which while perfectly correct, would sound "off", as it's just not common to use
I think you meant to answer another Redditor as I didn’t partake in that discussion
obrigada
No, I really meant to reply to you, when you said "not really" :)
Oh sorry, I’m on mobile and it became a little difficult to keep up with the comment thread
I get it now and your absolutely right I stand corrected
I wasn't aware
Fernando Pessoa, Saramago, Camões, Sophia de Mello Breyner and some other portuguese writers
I can only think of Anne Frank's Diary as a book that was not written by a Portuguese
In high-school if you choose literature you probably read more books from other countries but I don't really know
I don't remember reading Sophia, nor Anne Frank
I read "Os Maias", Eça de Queirós.
"Sermão de Sto
António aos Peixes".
"Os Lusíadas", Luís de Camões
That Saramago book about the Mafra monestary, I don't remember the title, because I hated it
"O livro verde de Cesário Verde"
"Felizmente há Luar", don't remember the author
A whole bunch of stuff from Fernando Pessoa and his multiple personalities, except for the most awesome one -- Livro do Desassossego (Book of Disquiet)
I don't think we ever talked about books not written in Portuguese
1) Cash
2) Ibuprofen
3) Gun
4) Weed
5) Motorcycle
6) Pastéis de nata
7) Cozido
8) Jewllery
9) Clothes
10) Dog
Just for living, since I don't exactly bring a lot of stuff with me when travelling
Smartphone
Nintendo Switch
Nintendo 3DS
GameCube
Headphones
Wii
SEGA Saturn
Csn only think of 7
Can't think of any
Bunker
I don't think any have made into the portuguese language
Unless you mean Poltergeist or Zeitgeist, but I don't remember the last time I've used such words in my life
Not exactly commonly used words
The only one I can think of is chiça, which is of celtic origin and shares a common cognate with the german word Scheiß
Although, it's not exactly a germanism strictly speaking, it does have german roots
Bunker
How often do you use such word on a daily basis
I never use it
That's not a germanism
That's the name of the pastry: Berlin Ball
That'd be akin to saying that French fries is a franconism
Sometimes I do, but not on a daily basis I guess
That
Is exactly my point
The pastry is called [*bolas de berlim*] literally Berlin balls, because they are pretty much [berliners] (but much better =)) . Its not a germanism
Rare ish but perfectly accepted provided it looks minimally clean and doesn't smell
Years of growing in a military base have conditioned me to not like long hair and facial hair
I had long hair and ponytail up until university
It would be frowned upon while looking for a job/ working so I cut it and never grew it back since
My first manager used to comment frequently if I didn't shave for one day or even didn't bring a belt (I was a consultant)
People in Portugal can still be quite conservative and shallow
In portuguese it's "Louva-a-deus", meaning "worship god" or "worshiper of god"
louva-a-deus, it kinda translates to
god praiser
That's exactly the same in Portuguese, wth
Louva-a-Deus
In Portuguese we call it louva-a-deus so not in all Romance languages
I mean the theme is similar but it's not exactly the same
Similar here
We call it "louva-a-deus" which means literally "praises-god".
Always one need to be the odd one out
Romania it's usually the one, but in this case they follow the norm so we were compelled to breach it
The gipsy king arent spanish
We speak Spanish or we are a province of Spain
That its spain, not portugal, and our spanish accent is realy good
Also brazil
Most people think portuguese comes from brazil, and cant distinguish Portugal and Brazil
#overall, learn basic geography
SpAiN 2
Mexico is also stereotyped in a similar way and they kinda like it
Why donyt you like it
France is actually one of the countries with the best military record, isn't it
Cheese eating surrender monkey*
Portuguese people that live in Porto call moors to the people living in Lisbon
I meant what offends us, not the reality
Not sure if cooler means happy drunk people or military :D
C'est pas possible
>Portuguese people that live in Porto call moors to the people living in areas south from Porto, but with a special hatred for Lisbon
Fix it
Øslo is from Bulgaria though
Half truth then
Just to deep into detail, do you mean south of Porto city or south of the metropolitan area
Just don't make it 8 years
>south of the metropolitan area
No idea
Then there is that thing abroad where they call "castles" (schloss, chateau) to things which to me clearly aren't
Castles in every town churches in every corner looks like
I've lost count
Uh thats a palace not a castle

Damn I wanna move to Sweden
That would be Gouveia, a city in Portugal
These are also valid:

Ofcourse, went to an edm festival here in portugal, and the people in the bus all started to sing the national hymn and and other portuguese shit, the foreigns were all cringing because they didnt understand shit, no one was even drunk, except for one guy who was screaming "E OS ESPANHOIS, VAO PO CARALHO" (fuck the spanish) by himself
Our drunks sing on the bus, on the street, the park, water fountains, at home at 4 in morning waking everyone in the building
That is glorious
Brazilian Portuguese seems to have more slightly different grammar and they also use a lot of incomprehensible slang and word things in a really strange way that Portuguese people don't. So it can happen, yes
Brazilian Portuguese is very easy to understand despite the pronounciation being quite different
Tbh it's harder to understand some versions that exist here in Portugal like the Azores and Madeira accents
Yes
Grammar differences and accents
Well nah, but of course there are 1 or 2 words that we dont get
While in there, there are some very thick accents that are barely comprehensible
I think it depends a lot on the specific Brazilian accent
If it's one of the more known ones you see in Brazilian soap operas and other media, it's easy to understand
If it's from up north or somewhere else where the accents get weird (from our perspective), then it can sometimes to very hard to follow
Also, it depends a lot on the context
Watching a [random internet video] will make it more difficult to understand than if I was having a conversation with someone I know about the weather, for example
You definitely havent met a Northern Portuguese
That's nothing
Northern Portugal is infamous for their profanity, some people can't say a phrase without one
You often see men greet each other by calling each other "meu caralho" (my dick) in an affectinate way
I'm from Northern Portugal btw
No idea
I'm not knowledgeable of the variety of Brazilian accents nor do I consume any Brazilian media
Which is a bit ironic considering we're more religious up here
Reaching India by sea
Like, by far
It was the culmination of 73 years of investment and blood poured into it, in attempts to legitimising Portugal as a country and a major global power for a good while
Especially when contrapuncted with Spain trying the same and failing (upwards, since they got to America, but still)
Conquering Ceuta, since it was the first step in the whole thing, discovering Brazil, or passing the various African capes and Gulfs (particularly the Torments cape) all definitely contribute to the image of the sailors and explorers that went against nature/monster/gods depending on the narrator, but it was all in hopes of reaching India to begin with
You can see it in our architecture, our music, our anthem, our national symbols, our linguistic expressions, our cuisine and everything else
It's like having won the biggest competition at the time whilst being the biggest underdogs
Idk about the most defining, another pt guy already posted a much more wholesone post full of positive things, but
There is still some resentment about one "portuguese" king (he was spanish) fucking up our whole armada trying to attack England (our oldest allie)
So, basically, the spanish fucked up our beautiful fleet, like, 300 or 400 years ago, and it was only downhill from there
Of course there is also the 16 year old king before that, that decided to kill himself without having childern in northern Africa
A good old prick that should return any day now in the fog
any day now
so that's how we got to have the same king as spain iirc
Anyways, fun fact, Brazil never became independent from Portugal
Our king just moved there in the napoleonic invasions and the country became independent from Brazil
We kept the other colonies, though
So all the other former colonies kind of became independent from Brazil, in a way, which for a short time had the capital of Portugal
I d say there are plenty
Probably the moment d Sebastião died which lead an iberian union and eventually to the fall of the portuguese empire
Also definitely the Implementation of the Republic and D. João Mestre de Avis being named king after we finally ended Spain's domain over us
Edit: Unfortunately, in terms of consequences, D. Sebastião's disappearance was what caused many of the events in the following centuries, so in a sense it also fits this question
In terms of national identity I think it's also worth mentioning the [Portuguese Restoration War] a 28 year long war that ended the Iberian Union and reinforced the idea of us being separate from the rest of the Iberian Kingdoms .
> More importantly, after 1668, Portugal, determined to differentiate itself from Spain, turned to Western Europe, particularly France and England, for new ideas and skills
This was part of a gradual "de-Iberianization", as Portugal consolidated its cultural and political independence from Spain
Portuguese nationalism, aroused by success on the battlefield, produced hostile reactions to Spain and to Spanish things and persons
We had so many wars against Spain that I don't think any one of them can be said to be the "defining one". Maybe Aljubarrota is the most famous, and 1762 was the definitive one
It certainly contributes to the national identity a ton, though
I hate oysters
In Portugal they're eaten alive with lemon juice
The problem for me is  not that they're alive, it is the taste
My family loves oyster but I can't stand them
I hate [Feijoada] but everyone here loves it
I'd rather eat rabbit kidneys, pig's ear or snails
At least they taste good
"Bacalhau á Brás"
It's basically fish and chips, but much worse
I dislike many popular portuguese foods
Probably the one I hate the most is the *Cozido à Portuguesa*, which basically a huge pot with all kinds of weird cuts of pork and beef, along with vegetables I also don't like
There's also *Caldo Verde*, which is a soup with these fine leaf strips that cling to the back of your throat when swallowing and it's frankly disgusting
Shellfish, especially prawns/shrimp are pretty popular here, and it's not that I hate it but I tend to find it a bit meh most of the time
Portuguese people are pretty keen on fruit in my experience, which isn't something I usually eat out of my own initiative, other than the occasional apple or pear
And there's lots of fruits I can't stand, including some popular ones like peach and pineapple
And Portuguese people also tend to love freshly squeezed orange juice, which I'm also not fond of
And there's also presunto (cured ham), which to me often tastes a bit too fatty and salty and has a kind of off-putting consistency, it's often greasy and really hard to chew, and then you sometimes swallow some of it which you think you chewed properly but it's still connected to a bit that's still in your mouth and now you've got a kind of unchewed bit in your mouth and a bit in your throat connected by a string and trying to chew and swallow triggers a gag reflex and it's also really hard to bring the other bit back up and it's 30 seconds of absolute torture, especially if there isn't a glass of water at hand
I do like it in thin slices with bread and/or cheese, especially if it's not too fatty
Edit: Caldo verde, aka "Portuguese kale soup". I'm pretty fond of soup in general, but I don't really like caldo verde
Whereas the opposite is actually kind of common: people who don't normally eat soup but get excited about caldo verde
We eat live stuff
Are oysters that popular in Portugal
I don't think I've ever even seen anyone eat oysters
I won't judge you because I don't like codfish of any kind
Feijoada is not my favorite but I don't hate it, what I really don't go along with is cozido à portuguesa and (sorry everyone) arroz doce I can't I just can't.
I'd like to contribute with Bifana
Not that I "hate" it, but foreigners and tourist always go crazy for this thing that's essentially bachelor's food
It's just some shit you eat when you need something fast and don't want to bother
That, sir, broke my heart
Yes
OYSTERS
I don't, but a lot of people do
It seems like it is more common in the Algarve
That you be considered almost a crime in Portugal LOL
The most cooking acceptable is vaporizing, and even already raises some eyebrows hahah
Never seen anyone eat oysters (ostras)
Are you sure you are Portuguese
In tha Algarve you see people eating them everywhere
In Lisbon it is not so common, but you can see it too
I don't understand how someone doesn't like codfish, my brother and sister both hate it but I love it no matter the recipe I just don't get it it's so good
Guys can we revoke this guy nationality
I also dislike Arroz Doce
I learned that Cozido à Portuguesa really depends on the cook
I both loved and hated it at times
Aletria I can stand
Arroz doce makes me want to throw up in my mouth
That is because you don't know about Silas in Benfica do Ribatejo
I don't know why don't expand their business
Best bifanas I know
Bifanas with a cold beer and a football game is all I need on a lazy summer evening
I mean it's happened to me a few times, I'm not sure if this happens to other people or if I'm just shite at chewing
The thought of it makes me really wary of eating presunto
I suppose kind of like those people who've had a fishbone incident as children and are really picky with fish
I'm from Porto, maybe it's more popular in some regions than others
it tastes like piss, only good cod is bacalhau à brás
Yeah I'm from Porto too and can confirm that oysters aren't popular here
Not so common, but you still see that today: people, mostly man, spitting in the floor
I think that's a thing everywhere
I can't remember a Christmas where I haven't watched both of them
That and the Monte Carlo circus, it's a staple of Christmas
I would say it is
They prefer triangles, sometimes – in very special occasions – squares
They kind of slightly touch but not full on kiss
Since both people are doing it at the same time on different angles your lips mostly just sort of graze the cheek
Hahah that happen to me when I moved to London to study, everytime someone introduced me i would lean for a kiss and then remember they don't kiss they give handshakes a see the face of confusion from the other person
r/breadbros
Street
Not sure, but I would say primarily old school adults in here
That’s another level
Well, you can always use paper tissues for that if needed
Edit: I misunderstood the beginning of your comment
Not as prevalent as McDonald's or Burger King, but they exist in Portugal
Generally you can find them in the food courts at malls, but a KFC on its own is quite rare I think
You can find separate McDonald's buildings with drive-thrus in cities, sometimes Burger King as well, but not really KFC or any other fast food chains
It's actually been quite a while since I've been to one
I like fried battered chicken, but not when it has bones or is greasy, so whenever I used to go to KFC I'd get a type of chicken steak that was really good, but then they took it out the menu
The chicken popcorn was also delicious, but I don't think they do that anymore over here
Not very
I mean it exists, like dunno pizza hut
Mcdonalds and burger king and some local chains are far more usual
Checking their site they might have 33 "restaurants" on the whole country
I checked and there are 179 McDonalds
We eat a lot of chicken, but that is awfully industrial looking
We probably got 30000 churrascarias selling frango de churrasco, though
19 outlets in June 2017 according to Wikipedia but you can find 30+ on their website
They been expanding well this last couple of years it seems
Edit: Vs 176 McDonald's and 101* Burger Kings (2019*)
I think that after hitting 18 you should be able to cook at least some meals (unless you have a disability or condition that prevents you to do so)
I didn't really cook much before going to university, and even then I made some very poor decisions regarding my meals during my first year
But once I moved into a house with friends I started to learn more as we all taught each other and shared tips
My friends and I have a lot of lunches and dinners at each other's' houses and so we all cook a lot
I mean, how else are you gonna feed yourself if you live alone
Maybe if you're a really young adult, as in 18-19, people won't think less of you if can't cook, but if you're 30
They probably will think that's odd
Really
Interesting
It's not part of the curriculum here
At least it wasn't when I was a kid
No idea of that has changed ever since but education in Portugal always seemed to fail when it came to teach practical stuff that could be useful to you on a daily basis
Yeah the kitchen used to be our main hub
Miss the talks we used to have there
This is a quite depressing thread to read as a Portuguese man
Damnit, we might as well be an island in the middle of the Atlantic
None
The question doesn't make much sense tbh
We're basically a continental island
We're by ourselves :(
Why
I enjoy being alone
Great that you mentioned your (world's) oldest alliance m8
Omg I'm gonna tear up
Portugal
It's quite different
Maybe not so much from Faro or Porto area
But in relation to the interior, it's really different
People from the interior and the Islands live simpler lives, many of them don't even own a computer or know much about the Internet
Not that they are poor, they just don't give much importance to that
Life in those places is very self centered
Kind of like those American small towns from the movies and series
The majority of people in Portugal live by the sea, especially in Lisbon or Porto
In Lisbon is 1/3 of the whole population
In the interior and islands people usually work in the primary sector or simple businesses
I honestly envy the people who live outside of Lisbon and the other big cities
I don’t know about the Azores but Madeira has about the same offer of commodities that Lisbon offers and has way nicer weather than anywhere in mainland Portugal
And people in Madeira don’t live a “simpler life” as you said, it’s kind of the same life as people from Lisbon but on a smaller scale
Lisbon has 1 million out of 11 hardly one third
People in the interior have less access to things, less stores so less competitive prices and are poorer on average because there's a lot of industry but they pay you minimum wage and often force you to work extra hours
Also s big part of the interior doesn't have água canalizada
Let alone gas, and kind of still live in last century
I grew up half there and half in London and a bit in Braga, boy where the cities really different to the interior it's shocking seeing how little access to things people have
>Lisbon has 1 million out of 11 hardly one third
Wrong
Lisbon metropolitan area has [nearly 3 million] And the population of Portugal is closer to 10 million than 11 million, more concretely [10 117 809]
And maybe that's your experience, and that's OK
But I own a house in a village in the district of Évora and it's nothing like that
Not saying that doesn't happen
edit: maybe that happened back when you lived there
In my village the government even pays subsidies for couples who go to live there and have a child
Many parts of the interior are now much better because there are policies in place to incentivise people to go live there
The problem has to do with job opportunities, as you pointed out
That's why I'm stuck in Lisbon
But it seems you have spoken about industries, so you are likely speaking about the North region, while I was thinking about Center and South, which is more focused on primary sector
I'm in Italy now and even though in the north people mainly work in industry they have money and are paid good salaries normally
In Portugal up north specially Felgueiras you'll have bosses with Porsche/Mercedez/jaguar and paying minimum wage and coercing workers into unpaid overtime
It's really sad and helps explain the inequality that subsists up north in those areas
I was thinking of city
You're right the metropolitan area is huge
North and South are quiet different, the north is statistically poorer than the South far poorer so that might skew my views, but the interior North and center is definitely poor
Yes and I grew up in "Celorico de basto"which is consistently the poorest area of the country every year
It's weird how such a small country is so different North/centre/south (and islands too)
We have something called Lotaria de Natal which i guess is similar but to be honest i have no idea how popular it is but it's definitely not an every family tradition like in Spain
I find it very funny how they sing the numbers
You guys are all rich af holy shit
Probably the most well known is Franklim Lobo, considered a “drug baron” (ie drug lord) and the biggest Portuguese dealer ever by our authorities
AFAIK he run drug trade not only in here, but also in Brazil, Spain and Morocco – with the help of someone from inside the police, who bragged of catching him twice
Edit: couldn’t found relevant or in-depth articles in English, but here’s [one] that will help
There's lots of drugs apprehension and, small and big time smugglers caught
I can't think of any one in particular
There's that humongous Atlantic coast with pleasant seas, and that great tradition of smuggling and off the books trading
Things kind of calmed down after the 90s. We used to have Europe’s largest heroin market smack bang in the middle of Lisbon
1% of the population was hooked on the drug at one point
Then decriminalisation happened etc
and you know the story
Now I think the most high profile kingpin is Benfica’s current president
Everybody knows he’s involved and a significant amount of cocaine mysteriously appeared in his car at one point but he’s untouchable atm
People all over Europe claim they possess the biggest entry point of drugs into Europe (Spain, France, Italy all have people claiming it) and this is also done with Portugal, but I’m not aware of any more famous or significant drug dealers
Maybe they’re good at what they do
Didn't know that
Most arrests that we know of don't have names that we can recognize
I mean, this time they caught some guys, that time they caught, those other guys
Right, it seems that most of them are minor characters and don’t have exactly an interesting story behind them – like this one
Or at least, they don’t have enough appeal to the press
That might explain, partially, what you are pointing out
I honestly can't see any part seceding, I think our country has been notoriously absent that type of drama (compared to some others that is)
The most likely to secede would be the autonomous regions, the Madeira and Azores archipelagos
Portugal doesn't have any seceding movements
There was a small one during the 70s in Madeira, but nothing too big
I would say the islands are the most probable
The Algarve, historically, would also be a good candidate
Sometimes there's a northerner or two that like to boast about being so different from the rest of the country, but it's just talk
The most likely would be the Algarve because it’s often forgotten by the government and it’s a region that could sustain it self, althought, it’s pretty unlikely
There’s a general sense of pride of being Portuguese so I don’t think it would ever happen
Fun fact: When our commies reinstalled democracy, Madeira had a secession movement, not a strong one
It only lasted a few months as there was another revolution that was more right wing
There were Azorean and Madeiran independence movements (I think some were straight up paramilitaries) after the 25th of April, but they were more politically motivated and mostly died when the islands were given autonomy
Northern Portuguese people tend to go chest-bumping about their identity a lot
Still far from seceding but still
Galicians have made some protests in Lisbon, as if trying to incite the Portuguese government to do something, not sure what
But I think Luso- reintegrationism is more about preserving culture, language and national identity than it is about seceding, no
The Azores had a secession movement too
I did not know about that
Yeah
I know quite a few northerns that would be perfectly happy with joining Galicia and leaving the south
I think more often stray animals have problems with people than the other way around
Yes there has been a few cases of people getting mauled by dogs lately
I think there is actually a lack of dogs in the Netherlands
Many portuguese stray dogs are sent to the netherlands to be adopted
I assume from other countries too
You should speak to the pack of stray dogs that roamed around my university campus around 2000
On a more serious note
It used to be worst in terms of dogs, but nowadays is more or less controlled
Can't say the same for cats which are everywhere, as they don't pose such a high risk for public safety
Let me guess: Universidade Nova FCT
Por acaso não. Pólo 2 Coimbra
Blue is the standard here
Black is also normal, but less common
Well, around here, whatever you do, don't use red ink
Not on paper, not on e-mails
It's rude
The myth is that when you use red ink you are telling the recipient of your text to f* off
Only people allowed to use red ink are teachers, for grading papers, and that's it
Blue or black
I'm a teacher
I've observed that,  while my kids are younger, they prefer blue, but as they grow older some prefer black
I usually use a black pen to wite and a pink pen to grade the work of the younger ones
As they grow older I use a red grading pen
its the opposite here
Blue ink on everything "important" or official
And red is an insult to the reader, supposedly
Definitely
Fun fact my teacher suggested that we should all use black ink back in highschool (because of photocopying) and now I use black for any oficial papers
The thing about red ink is silly, in my opinion
I grade my students work with pink or red pens
I don't know what's insulting about that
Isn't it what grades all are about
Teachers get a free pass for writing in red
I wish my teachers used pink to grade my papers
So cute
Also, I do think it's a myth, but just in case, I avoid writing in red
I think that the insult is the presumption that you'd outrank them
Teachers outrank students, so it's appropriate
I think it's just an urban meme, to try and force people to write in colours that are actually readable
It's a myth
Teachers grade the students work in a different colour because the student and the parents need to see where the mistakes are
I use pink or read but other teachers use green, or other colours
Yeah that's always been my interpretation of it
It's like you're presenting yourself as an authority figure
But only imagine if the person on the other side believes in the myth
That's my "just in case"....
I'd explain why I use my red pen
If the belief was too deep I'd use another colour
Deep beliefs are out of my job description
Edited a typo
I remember both back when I was a kid, though it was more common for the children to outnumber the adults
My cousins' birthday parties were pretty much excuses for my aunt and uncle to have an adults party as well though
Not common here either
You just drop off your little gremlins and have an afternoon free
God bless birthdays and sleepovers
But that’s more of a family party too not a typical party with school friends
In portugal we always have to study the variants of portuguese (miraandese, brazilian, african, asian)
And the variants through time
Since Galician and Portuguese are related and share the same medieval origin and even some people consider them dialects of the same language, do you study anything about Portuguese
In Portugal, we only study some medieval poems in galego-portuguese but nothing about the modern language of galician
We also don't study anything about regional accents or dialects spoken in other Portuguese-speaking countries
we don't study about how they are different, but we do study works from different dialects of Portuguese
don´t you study any portuguese poets, d dinis for example
ai flores do verde pinho
We study some galician poets, I think the first poem on my portuguese literature textbook was by Martin Codax, ai ondas do mar de vigo
Gotta love bifanas my man
Well, since I speak some German, this is an interesting thread
My gut instinct says Germany since Standard German is more commonly spoken there than it is in Switzerland or Austria
But I have a feeling I'd assimilate more easily in Austria
It's a small country like mine and seems cosier, dunno
Can't imagine myself living in Switzerland, tbh
Germany
People seem more open and welcoming too, which on top of what you mentioned would make me go for Germany 100%.
Sure, but that's not an important factor to me
Well Porto Lisboa is cheap compared to Lisboa Faro which is 3 times that
the only thing outside Lisbon is the Portguese Navy and it's just across Lisbon, on the other side of the river
Not very common in Portugal
Very centralized in Lisbon
Only now with this new government they established some secretaries of state in the interior regions
Yes and some institutions/organizations may have their "HQ" in Porto but is just on paper, they still use the Lisbon offices as their main one (ex: AICEP)
Portugal is very centralized unfortunately
Which books from your country's required reading program did you struggle with the most
I'm a bookworm, I love books and reading, but even I had problems finishing some books for our Portuguese classes
Most notably:
* *Os Maias* (The Maias) by Eça de Queirós: super, super descriptive, the author could easily cut pages of unnecessary descriptions that add nothing to the plot
Plus, it criticizes Portuguese culture to a point of considering it worthless in comparison to British culture, who the author places on a pedestal
Then, there's that ending
Yikes
* *O Memorial do Convento* (Baltasar and Blimunda in the translated version) by José Saramago: I couldn't get behind the writing style with no punctuation
What about you
Though you weren't required to read it, " O livro do desassossego" (book of disquiet) really fucked up my grades
*Os Maias* it's awful
Couldn't finish it, even the professor hated the book and wanted us to read *A Cidade e as Serras* instead
I think it was the only book that we had to read that I genuinely didn't like
There are 16 pages describing what a house looks like
O Memorial do Convento may be my favourite book we read in school
I love Saramago, once I got behind the style with no punctuation I found his storytelling masterfull
*As Intermitências da Morte* it's my favourite book ever
MFW i didn't read either of the ones OP said and passed the exams and tests about them
The ammount of resumes and movies you can find about major reading program books is uncanny
( I know i somewhat am not adding anything new to the thread since it's the same as OP, but if you're currently going through a "reading program" it's likely you can find resumes of it on the web
I have nothing against José Saramago, but the fact that he writes the way he does it just makes it harder for me to enjoy his books
I once tried to read Memorial do Convento and I dropped it after the first 2 pages
Read it through some classmates notes to study for a test and never touched it again
And Maias
My god
That 80 something pages where he describes the house
It made me rip my hairs, it's awful
But I really enjoyed reading Fernando Pessoa and his heteronyms
Man, you're lucky you didn't have to read "O ano da morte de Ricardo Reis" it's so fucking boring I remember reading 10 pages and not a remembering a single thing of what I'd just read
Plus yeah yeah Saramagos writing style is shit
I did like "Os Maias" though, probably my favourite book I ever had to read for school
I never read it, but I saw [this really funny summary] of it on Youtube
I had no idea it was Cervantes's response/rant towards the old chivalry and knights' books
It's so petty and I love it
Same here
From my experience most non-humanities people either love *Os Maias* and hate *O Memorial do Convento* or vice-versa
Very few have actually read both, and I'm in the same camp as you
The sad thing is, without having delved further, I've been told that Eça de Queiroz has much more interesting books than that particular one, but I'm really not that interested in going further because of that bore
I enjoyed "Felizmente há Luar" and "O Auto da Barca do Inferno". Too bad our school didn't let us go to watch the play because of the profanity
This is curious, because all the people I know that were in the social sciences group ("Humanidades") really enjoyed "Os Maias" and I think all the people I know that went into other areas ended up hating it
I think the book taps a lot into one's taste for language and reading, so those who are not so much into that won't appreciate it as much
It could also have to do with the way the book is approached in classes
In my day, the Portuguese subject for the human sciences students was very different from the Portuguese classes that were taught for science/economics/arts students - they were even called different names ("Português A" and "Português B")
That could have played a major role in how people enjoyed the book
I wasn't counting the plays since those were already in the textbook and were pretty short but yeah a barca do inferno was pretty cool and we did see the play which to me made the story much better, but in terms of plays "Um auto de Gil Vicente" and "Frei Luis de Sousa" are much more interesting, and I just really like Almeida Garret's work in general
"Felizmente há Luar" wasn't in the program anymore so I never got to read it
That's weird
I actually remember watching both of those plays
"O Auto da Barca do Inferno" was really funny
I would also add "Frei Luís de Sousa" to your list
I hated having to read that
Even though it was a bit better than the other two
>"Felizmente há Luar" wasn't in the program anymore so I never got to read it
It's good, makes you understand better why Beresford got sent packing back to England by the rebels
> "Frei Luis de Sousa"
This is so ironically good
"Romeiro, romeiro
Quem és tu
" is bloody iconic
Older Portuguese stuff like Camões has the original text with only updated orthographic rules, I believe
For more modern stuff, it's not really an issue, as the language has kept stable-ish for the last 400 years or so
To add a Portuguese perspective to u/Marianations topic about *"Don Quijote"* being old Spanish, in Portugal *"Os Lusíadas"* by Luis de Camões is studied in its original version with old Portuguese
Which kinda makes it a drag to read but since it's poetry, it would lose all rhymes if it was translated to modern Portuguese
> as the language has kept stable-ish for the last 400 years or so
Not really, there have been plenty of ortographic changes, it's just that in more "modern works", it's not that much of a hassle nor does it affect the work when it's adapted into the current Portuguese spelling
"Os Lusíadas" is a special case because it's poetry and it has to obey rhyme and metric rules, so it's a lot trickier to adapt into modern writing
Most versions have updated orthography of the old words whenever it doesn't affect the metric
Just like you don't write Luiz de Camoens
Dama (dame/lady) is coming back into use in slang
It's being brought back from immigrants from the PALOPs and it's already part of the hiphop jargon
I hope you are joking I have been living here for 2 years now and food is terrible
I have a theory that the further south you go, the more of an extrovert you are
Brazilians complain that we are too serious and uptight, but then again people call us the Mediterranean Nordics, so what do I know
\*shrug\*
I never understood the siesta
How do you do it
Do you stop working and take a nap
Where do you sleep if you're not at home
Does everyone sleep or do you take turns
Thanks for explaining
Switzs don't have a sick society with a lot of poverty and social inequality, corruption, greed and drugs
So yeah, if you add guns to social inequalities, poverty, greed, corruption and drugs, you have mass shootings
Mass shooting and gun crimes in the US happen either because you have disturbed individuals or in situations like gang fights
Gang violence is clearly associated with a climate of poverty
When you grow up in a society that tells you that if you don't go to the best school, the best college, buy the finest clothes, a new iPhone every year, have a lot of sex and girls you are a loser and if you are a loser you deserve to end up being poor and homeless, I assume it's natural that you grow up being mentally disturbed and want to shoot people
You can ban guns in the US, they will still find a way to kill people, maybe not as effectively, but it won't cure the disease
I don't see Switzs looking down or treating badly the less fortunate of society, they take care of them
I don't see the Switzs denying medical healthcare to people if they can't afford it (they have private health care but it's heavily financed by the government and they help people who can't afford it), you don't see Switzs allowing companies to poison their natural resources and their people just for profit, you don't see Switzs sending their youngester to die in a far away land so that some companies can profit from a multibillion dollar war industry, you don't see Switzs allowing Big Pharma to pressure doctors to prescribe opiates to everyone leading to widespread opioid epidemic
I can go on
Former gun-owning American here
I've never heard anyone in my shooting circle cite Switzerland as the shining example of positive gun ownership given that the circumstances of ownership, social environment, and general culture are completely different
More or less, the reason we have/had a gun was simply because we could
Mass shootings make up a fraction of gun deaths in the US, and most lethal gun violence is committed with illegally obtained weapons anyway
Should there be more checks against people who want to buy weapons
Sure absolutely
The government cannot simply say "no more weapons" as it's unconstitutional
The challenge of whether weapons were intended for personal use was already decided by SCOTUS in 2008
In NJ where I'm from, the state can make it extremely difficult to get the permits and purchase docs ready, which isn't the case somewhere like Texas or Georgia
It's a complex issue that I don't expect non-Americans to understand, and here in Australia I constantly get people asking like "hurr durr why cant they just remove guns" - Viewing the violence issue back home in such a reductionist fashion is honestly just goofy as fuck
The culture around mass shootings is one that is regrettable, and sure banning guns might stop it but imho thats just a band-aid to the actual problem; what makes people want to do this to begin with
Maybe I'm an idealist, but theres a much deeper root to the problem simply than being able to buy an AR15
I'd argue their gun culture in general is a much bigger issue than gun laws
If I wanted to, yes
I live with my parents, I have no debt and I don't have hight monthly fixed costs
But I am trying to save up, so, no, I don't right now
And I believe I will never have enough disposable income if I keep living in Portugal for now ;\_\_ ;
Happens all the time
I hate it
Not really, but I often don't know how to translate certain English words to Portuguese
Holy crap, you guys exist on reddit
RTP1, it's owned by the State but I'm pretty sure they have freedom of speech there, I mean a comedy group had a show in that channel where they made fun of our prime minister for being a corrupt dumbass so it's not a "state propaganda channel" I guess
Now if you're talking about the number 1 most viewed channel, it's gotta be either SIC or TVI, they're not owned by the State, and they both share the title of the most viewed channel basically
SIC is the most watched, or at least it was in 2020
It's a general channel, with news, soaps, and daytime TV
It was also the first non-state broadcaster in Portugal, so that's nice
As for which channel is first on the programming grid, it's RTP1, which is the state broadcaster's original channel
RTP 1, the Portuguese Public Broadcasting Company, was the first TV channel to air in Portugal in the '50s. It broadcasts the most diverse content to please all types of people, but it isn't the most popular TV channel (from far), mainly because it doesn't broadcast typical Portuguese soap operas and reality shows like private channels do (Channel 3 - SIC and Channel 4 - TVI) in prime time (all of these are open-to-air)
CMTV for the most popular
Lol
I haven't seen much political satire in our State owned channel(s), but they haven't done as many comedy shows as they did back then, and that comedy group disbanded, while I'm pretty sure they made fun of other parties, they mostly made fun of our ex PM as I mentioned, simply because he's one of the main reasons portugal suffered so much during the euro crisis
Fun fact: said channel is funded by a special "audiovisual" tax on the electricity bill, even if you don't own a TV
Ah yes known for such hits as "Velório em direto"
Some years ago we had some changes in the way we actually write words, and since it's still really recent a lot of people still write some words the old way and are against it
We call it "novo acordo ortográfico" and it was created so that Brazilians and Portuguese could have a more cohesive way of writing things
Some examples:
Then: acção | vêem | recepção
Now: ação | veem | receção
And there's a lot more than this
It makes everything kind of confusing and actually not cohesive at all since some people (mostly 40+ yo) refuse to use it because it was not the way they learned things
With some words it actually makes sense removing certain letters as they're not really pronounced, but then theres words liked "Egipto" (Egypt) becoming "Egito", this despite the fact that everyone here pronounces the "p" and "Egípcio" (Egyptian) still retains it
E porque na sua base está mal feito, eu escrevo no novo acordo exceto para as palavras para/pára e em fato/facto
It doesn't work in Romance languages either and it usually does turn into incomprehensible gibberish if you try it, or at least it changes the intended meaning
And like u/Mahwan, I've also always been a bit jealous of that "trick" you can do in Germanic languages
At least in Portuguese, you use prepositions (usually "de" meaning "of") or turn one of the nouns into an adjective
For instance, tennis ball is literally ball of tennis and science fiction is literally scientific fiction
The last time that happened it lasted 60 years
If it were to happen again, I hope we'd be able to break the speed record
That would not last
to be sincere it would be beneficial for us economically but national pride would never allow that
Didn't go well for us the first time
BOIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII

Portugal caralho
If a country merges with another one that has 5 times more people, the interests of the bigger one will prevail because it has a lot more voters
És um espanhol fodido
and this is why the union is impossible you guys are just too evil
A country in the EU has a lot more liberty to decide their own laws than a region in a country has
But if the economy is destroyed, there will be nothing worth pillaging
They should go to Ireland instead
Establish Dublin 2
I don't have anything against Spain
Everything I said here applies to any country merging with a significantly bigger country
I don’t have a clue
Yeah, what's up with that
I mean, you're not required to answer them
Neither do I.
I don't know why you use then
Since you are Romanian it's obvious you would say that
Romania has a very nationalistic identity and people from there usually don't like others commenting on their country
This is mainly due to the 1986 revolution and the political movements that came from that
Although a large portion of the population will say most were against the creation of the new parties, it could be argued that what really gave them strength to get going was the huge anti-fascist social movements that emerged from the aftermath of the crisis, that's pretty much explains why the country is the way it currently is and also why Romania sucks at football
(I'm sorry)
many traits of the Spanish Black Legend
Spain was not a specially evil empire
Plenty of other countries did as much of awful things as them
Well, Portugal turned out to be quite the Vietnam whenever someone tried to invade us so it's only half wrong
Probably Belém Tower, but we have a lot of other important monuments
Random fact: the Vietnamese language uses the Latin alphabet because Portuguese priests introduced it there
If you think our beer is bad, you clearly haven't tasted spanish beer
If we only count the mainland, France, under Napoleon tried three times and failed three times
Both are wrong actually
The first invasion was successful, and the french occupied Portugal
General Junot invaded through the Tagus Valley
This proved to be an awful decision, due to the difficult terrain and lack of infrastructure
Out of the 25000 men that crossed the portuguese border, only 10000 made it to Lisbon, and all cannons except for 4 were lost on the way
They reached Lisbon on the 30 of November 1807, entering Lisbon with only 1500 men, but there was no opposition, as the portuguese army was incredibly small and outdated, and composed mainly of popular militias
France held Portugal for around a year
Popular revolts, french lack of manpower (due to the Tagus Valley) and the help of the UK made it possible to expell the french
The battle of Vimeiro (the portuguese and british troops commanded by General Freire and General Wellesley) and the Convention of Sintra ended french occupation of Portugal
The second invasion wasn't as successful as the first one
The french plan, under General Soult, had the objective of conquering Porto first, and then Lisbon
They first tried to invade through the Minho River, but the only way to cross it was using fishing boats
Only 300 men could cross the river at the same time, and portuguese militias stationed on the other side made it impossible to cross
They then tried to invade through Chaves
This proved successful, and the french occupied Porto
The city was incredibly well defended, but the low quality of the portuguese army proved fatal
However, portuguese and british troops, under General Wellesley, General Beresford and Brigadier Silveira managed to take strategic positions around the city and further south (on the way to Lisbon), surrounding the french
Soult was forced to retreat north, leaving everything behind, except for food and ammo
The third invasion was headed by General Massena
Between the Second and Third invasions, the portuguese army was restructured and modernised, under the rule of General Wellesley
Wellesley had been given full control of portuguese troops, merging the portuguese and british armies
This new force was the Anglo-Portuguese Army
Lisbon's defense systems were also updated
Since the city is located on a peninsula, it can only be invaded by the north
There, a new line of defense infrastructure (named the Line of Torres Vedras) was built
Massena invaded through the Beiras region, with 65000 men
Upon reaching Torres Vedras, he realised he couldn't invade Lisbon
He held his position nearby for 4 weeks
Meanwhile, the portuguese troops were recieving more training, and were getting better and better (until then the portuguese army was incredibly outdated)
After those 4 weeks, he retreated to Santarém, to obtain food and other resources
But pressure from the anglo-portuguese army and local militias forced him to retreat north, to get more resources
The battles of Redinha and Sabugal and the Siege of Almeida put an end to this invasion
Everybody seats at the same table
From the baby to the 90 year old great-grandma
As far as I'm concerned, here in Portugal we're not used to do that
If they are 1-3 yo babies we have [this chairs] so they can be at our height
I'm the youngest member of my family and I'm 30 years old
When I was a kid, I was the only one
So I didn't need my own table
Not afaik
I've been doing it countless times, throughout my life
Not rude, though now that I think of it, it's not very common to see it happen
People just prefer to stop somewhere and eat, rather than eat while moving
Probably a cultural thing, given our relationship with food in general
Eating smelly, messy foods on small enclosed spaces like public transportation *is* frowned upon though and it's likely even not allowed
Rude
Thst sounds weird
Why would it offend people
Me too
But it can be rude to bring food into places or eating while interacting with other people
“The portuguese will not govern themselves and they won’t let anyone else govern them either”
Originally, it was supposedly said by julius caesar about the people that was here at the time
Julius Ceaser:
"At the ends of the Iberian Peninsula there's a people that doesn't govern itself nor does it let itself be governed
Portugueses courts are divided in 4 halls (called jurisdictions):
- Courts of Justice: headed by the Supreme Court of Justice, with 60 civilian judges and 4 military judges
- Administrative Courts: headed by the Supreme Court of Administration, with 26 judges
- Court of Auditors: with 19 judges
- Constitucional Court: with 13 judges
Then there are some special courts:
Peace Courts
Arbitral Tribunals
Ecclesiastic Tribunal
Pretty much the same as in English
But the pronunciation of 1 is a bit hard for foreigners
Structurally it's quite similar to English I guess:
* You read the numbers (> 20) in the order they're written, affected by their place in the overall number (i.e. no German switching around thing)
* Numbers 0-10 have very unique names, 11-19 have names clearly related to 1-9, and so do the multiples of 10 and multiples of 100 (i.e. no French "quatre-vingts" madness)
* Unlike English but like most other European languages I think, we separate the decimal part using a comma and pronounce it comma ("vírgula") as well, even though point ("ponto") is sometimes used as well
I'll try to focus on some differences and quirks:
* You always say "e" (and) between numbers, except between thousands and hundreds, e.g. 43 is quarenta e três, literally "forty and three". 29578 would be literally "twenty and nine thousand five hundred and seventy and eight".
* For some reason, the "e" is written, but never actually pronounced, at least in my experience, in the numbers 25, 26, 27 and for some people 28
* The number 100 itself is "cem" but in numbers from 101-199 you read the 1 as "cento" instead
* Like I said before, the numbers 200, 300, ..., 900 actually have their own names, even though they follow a general pattern
* Thousands are very similar to English: 3 is três, 1000 is mil, 3000 is três mil
The only difference is that we don't say the "one" in "one thousand".
* Millions are always plural, except for 1 million of course
And if there's nothing else after the million we add "de" (of)
So where in English you'd say "5 million people", we literally say "5 millions of people". Billions, trillions, etc
work the same way
* We use the long scale billion but we don't have unique words like "milliard" for 10\^9 and so on
We just say "a thousand millions" for instance
* Some numbers are conjugated according to gender - 1, 2 and all the multiples of 100 except 100 itself
You conjugate any instance of these numbers appearing in the middle of the number, e.g. the "1" in "51246". Digits that are above the million are always masculine though, because they apply to "millions" and not the thing the whole number applies to
* For ordinals, we make every component of the number into an ordinal
So "145th" is not "a hundred and forty fifth" but "hundredth fortieth fifth". This even applies to numbers like 12 with unique names - we don't have a unique word for "twelfth", we say "tenth second". The need for unique words for all of these means a lot of the higher ones aren't actually everyday words
I just realised I'm not actually sure how you say "200th" in Portuguese
same, but in Portuguese
With a small difference in that we separate the numerical parts (see 127, we say "cento e vinte e sete")
Unless in Spanish it is just a matter of preference and they do it both ways
I don't know much about Spanish
Latin speakers unite
if you are an English native, try to speak in English first and if it not works try to speak whatever gets you understood
Speaking Spanish in the first place would be seen as ignorance of your part in assuming Spanish is spoken in Portugal
If you are a Spanish native speaker, speak Spanish, Portuguese or English, no problem
Sorry France, you're too anglo saxon for us
But we'll let you sit at our table and share a beer (or wine)
French language has celtic and frankish (germanic) influences, although it's mostly vulgar latin (contrary to classical latin)
Some they will keep using
Because it is theirs and has been theirs for a very long time
In Lisbon I am thinking of the Navy dock which is still theirs to use on the same place since we have had a navy so 800+ish years or their arsenal installations (in arsenal street obviously) which has their arsenal since at least the 1500s. It is used formally even if not of practical use
Some military installations if less noble are being decommissioned - an old military factory complex is becoming this hipster business/arts centre, some old military hospitals or headquarters might become hotels (what else
maybe the pandemic will put a damper on it)
But a lot of things, if not totally impractical, it is still theirs
GNR still is headquartered in Quartel do Carmo and next to Belém Palace and a few other things
The [Beja Airbase]  was built in the 60's, established under a bilateral agreement with West Germany to be used the German Air-force for training purposes
After the German unification, it was no longer needed by Germany, so the Portuguese Air-force over all the installations
In 2009 a commercial terminal was established there
The project was a complete failure, jokingly people here in Portugal say that more probes have landed on Mars than commercial flights in Beja
Not sure whether or not I answered the survey
Surprised about the amount of Americans
I was thinking that the number was based on the amount of Americans asking questions over here, but they had to have filled out the survey correct
Thanks
Also sorry if what I wrote sounded harsh
Most of the American flags I see are usually from users asking questions here, whereas most of the American users residing in Europe (or Europeans residing in America) who I notice responding and participating in discussions have an American flag alongside another, hence my question
That's not to say they aren't part of the community though
Moonspell is probably our most famous band despite being a bit niche
Since Eurovision 3 years ago, Salvador Sobral might actually be the more famous
Moonspell and Madredeus would be the two Portuguese bands to reach some kind of international success
Both are rather niche bands and not exactly household names
Big metalheads generally know of Moonspell, but if you're not into metal then it's very unlikely that you've heard of them
As for individual singers, that would be Amália Rodrigues
She's the one to thank for Fado music being somewhat known outside of Portugal and eventually becoming UNESCO World Cultural Heritage
Amália Rodrigues
Salvador Sobral for about
2 months
Amália Rodrigues, Nelly Furtado, Shawn Mendes (only the father is portuguese, but still)
If we can count with Portuguese descendants, I’d say: Nelly Furtado, Shawn Mendes, Katy Perry, Sean Paul, Phil Demmel (Machine Head’s guitar player), Jay Kay (Jamiroquai’s vocalist), David Lee Roth (Van Halen’s vocalist), Joe Perry (Aerosmith’s guitar player), Steve Perry (Journey’s vocalist) and Sky Ferreira

I think because of "more than words" bettencourt is probably the most successful portuguese musician, although no one knows/cares that he's portuguese
Generally you greet drivers, people working in shops and restaurants, at the front desk, etc
basically aknowledging their existance verbally
Also not uncommon to greet your neighbors and people you come across when on a walk, though the latter is more common if there aren't that many people where you are
You don't need to say anything to the bus driver in Portugal unless you're buying a ticket
If you have a pass you just swipe it on the machine
As a portuguese, I would never do that
Unless the bus was empty and I knew the bus driver
In a big city, when there's a lot of people wanting to go on the bus, I never greet the bus driver - most people, in my experience, never do it as well
If the bus is empty and i'm the only one getting in, I might say good morning or nod, but that's it really
Shit, I thought germans were a lot different from us but it looks like you are describing the portuguese people in the supermarket
Exiting the lift only to be greeted by someone standing in front of it waiting to get
Don't forget to apologize
I witnessed that so often when I was studying in Scotland
That's happened a few times to me in Portugal, but yes it's more likely people laugh about it in the UK
I both like and feel confused by it
I appreciate the politeness, but also feel like there's unnecessary ant excesive apologizing going on
I think "desculpe" is perfectly acceptable in those situations
It's pretty synonymous with "com licença" in that context
I guess I didn't really think of "sorry" as being the same thing as "excuse me". I genuinely thought people were apologizing when there was no need
Nutri Ventures, the cartoon was fun and the theme song was a bop
Yes, and after that Plague Dogs, which as you may have already guessed is about doggies
In Portugal’s Portuguese, “rapariga” just means girl
In Brazil’s Portuguese it sort of means prostitute
So saying like “I’m talking/seeing this “rapariga” “will have a very different meaning in each country
It's not the same language, but in Spanish, "pila" means battery, and in Portuguese means dick
Also, in Spanish "me **meo**" means 'to piss myself', but in Portugal, [MEO] is a big telecommunications brand
In Portuguese from Portugal "rapariga" its girl but in Portuguese from Brazil "rapariga" its bitch
In European Portuguese "rapariga" means girl, so saying "olha ali aquela rapariga" (look at that girl over there) is pretty common
In Brazilian portuguese "rapariga" actually means whore, so saying the exact same thing "olha ali aquela rapariga" actually means "look at that whore over there".
Some Brazilian friends mocked me for a while because of this
Also in Portugal the word "pau" is fairly common and means stick/wood (and can also be used as slang for Euros), but in Brazil they often use it as slang for "dick".
"Sen hora" is not as similar to the Portuguese "senhora" as it seems
That Portuguese word breaks into syllables in this way: se-nho-ra
Bicha is a word with a double meaning though
It means both queue (in some parts of the country) but it also means faggot
Everything else is absolutely on point
You're not a true Portuguese if you don't have a beard
The popularity drops in part because of white/gray hair, as soon as grey starts showing in the beard most man decide to start shaving
You're not a true Portuguese if you don't have a ~~beard~~  mustache
Moustache is a requirement
Beard is optional
There was a time when a friend of mine was like, what do you think about the photo on my profile
I told him, looks good, you look exactly like the stereotypical portuguese with that mustache
He was like, dude I was talking about the banner
Sadly my mustache only looks good with a beard accompanying it :/
Honestly I'm confident
We aren't playing well but we didn't won the cup playing a brilliant football
We have a good mix of youth and experience and amazing players for most of positions
And most important, we play as a team were they seem to be playing together for a long time
So yeah, let's go Portugal
Oh, yeah, do pretty bad in the group stage but scrape by because we can end third on the group and pass
It is an interesting group though : world champions, european champions, the host country of that group (or tournament) which is Hungary and then Germany
I think this is memorable as a likely "group of death".
We will give it a try
I am not sure if we have finished trolling football fans
edit - if you want a specific scenario, a hunch that it is going to look like the third best of our group will not qualify and we are on real danger of crashing out and then somehow we end up SECOND in group and third place does not qualify
With that group stage and how meh we're doing at the WC qualifying right now i'm not sure but i do think we got a good team and if we won the euros with a much inferior team i believe there's an even bigger chance to win it this time again
Lmao we, the french and the german are talking shit about ourselves  and the hungarys are chilling like it as a normal group
Well considering that Portugal is in the group of death
I'm not really sure
Portugal has a great pool of players who are in form but cannot seem to gel together when playing on field
Whoever gets out of that group alive surely will reach the final
You calm down now, Éder will not be called for the euros
Considering that the four best third placed teams will also pass the group stage, I think that Portugal, Germany and France will all advance to the round of 16
I think the group will be France first, Portugal second, Germany third, Hungary last
We will beat the record and win euro2021 only with draws
Probably the most talented set of players in our history trained by an old men who knows shit about football
"We play as a team" oh boy you must have missed some of our games hmm
Nandinho Santos would love this
He's more than an idol, he's like a god hahaha
Sincerely now, he has become the simbol of that tournament, when you talk about Éder, you remember euro2016
He is not an idol exactly, because he has a very quiet life
He is very nice, and had this very hard childhood, so he would be liked even if he did not score that goal, but now he has godhood-meme status
Difficult to describe
Hope he has a good life
He might be paid lots of coffees and meals by strangers for the rest of his life though
I wouldn't mind it either
God bless Lord Éder
German
I really don't understand why so many people dislike German
Not only i think it sounds beautiful, but in my mind is th inly proper language for poetry
Russian, it just sounds great
I really like Japanese, since I'm a weeb and I'm quite used to the language by now
It has some familiar sounds and some quite unfamiliar ones too
Some words are really strange, while others sound super nice
European, I'd say Greek
For some reason it has this rythm and tine that I really like
The funniest part is that in the middle of gibberish, sometimes a word I know pops up (like "democracy")
That's always hilarious to me
Is there an historic figure that is considered a villain in your country but a hero in another
Napoleon is viewed positively in several countries, but is considered a tyrant in Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom, responsible for many deaths, rapes and looting
Similarly, William Beresford was choosen by the British goverment to organize the Portuguese army after the King fled to Brazil, but he began to demand more and more power, even sentencing to death a group of rebels who were trying to get the King to return, and made no secret that he thought the British were superior to the Portuguese
This lead to him being kicked out of the country and return to the UK were we mas named Master General of Ordnance
Are there similar cases in your country
EDIT: Oh my God
I wasn't expecting so many responses
Thank you so much
All Philips were hated in Portugal, but specially the Filipe III
I get the men, but what did Catherine do Poland
What is the British opinion of him
Neutral
We have the Duke of Wellington in high regard, but not Beresford
Trafalgar is not a person though
Frederick and Catherine were the monarchs behind the partition of Poland
We almost lost Brazil to the Dutch because of him
He raised the taxes extremely high, threatened to close the ports, and all that money went to Madrid
No wonder people were pissed
I'm talking about your Filipe IV, which was our Filipe III
Fawkes or V?
Olivares was his most trusted advisor so I would put the blame on both of them
The funny thing is, the previous Filipes left Portugal rather autonomous, if Filipe number III/IV hadn't gotten greedy they probably wouldn't revolt
until much later
English is useful as a language almost everyone can speak a little
Our language is the way we speak at home, with your family
Thanks to Brazil, I think my language is here to stay for a while
But with the widespread of social media, I can see European Portuguese disappear in favour of Brazilian Portuguese
So if you think about it a sentence here and there could have way more impact than you believe
I mean in just a couple of years we started to use english expressions/words a lot more often
In another couple of years more and more english words will be used
So perhaps in the future our languages won't be so far apart as we may think no
Another comment in this thread by a dutch:
>"There was [an article] two weeks ago about how Dutch children are increasingly spelling words the English way
For example, they are spelling *koffiee* as "coffee", and *familie* as "family", *koelkast* as "coolkast".
>There are also other regular articles about [*verengelsing*] For example, [in universities] In [Amsterdam] it's got to the point where sales and wait staff speak mostly English
Amsterdam is rapidly becoming an English-language city, I would say
It's not unusual for Dutch speakers working in Amsterdam to stay in English even when dealing with other Dutch people
So, yes, some people are worried about this
The language is strong, but English is a threat
Interesting fact:  When the Netherlands was invaded by the French around 1800, French became the official language for a few years
I witnessed it in Wandavision when Wanda was talking to young pietro in english which really annoyed me
It might, around the world
There's so many Brazilians and they move around so much
In Portugal, I don't believe that the European Portuguese would be replaced
We have so many Brazilian friends, we see so many Brazilian telenovelas and we still speak European Portuguese
That's really interesting
I felt the same when going to algarve
It was sad
But for you it's worse since it's your own capital that's being affected
2009, when Bitcoin was dirt cheap
At the time I was a child so I didn't know about it and didn't have any money to invest in it
If I didn't take Bitcoin into consideration I would say the best times in Portugal were the early 2000's. Since 2009/2010 Portugal has been a completely unstable place when it comes to politics and economics

The dragon ball dub is a pretty famous one
It's full of jokes about famous people or weird events related to Portugal
Some say it's the best dub in the world but I think it's most due to nostalgic memories since it first premiered in 1995
For me it's awful, the dub it's mostly improvised dialogs, they just ignore the actual thing that's being said that is important to the story to make a joke
Our Dragon Ball dub is something unbeliavable
Brazilians thought it was a parody when they watch it
Names were changed, accents were added, jokes no one outside Portugal would understand
It's insane and we love it
We got ours from France
Picollo was translated to Coraçãozinho de Satã (little heart of Satan)
Pretty unique, wouldn't you say
Portugal has 4
Lisbon, Porto, Braga and Loulé.
There's 5 IKEA in Portugal
Don't know the exact number but we have some here in Portugal
Low quality stuff but you always find something when u get there
It's not in Porto btw, it's in Matosinhos
I was bored and went to their website, we have 5 Ikea stores
Well, in that case there aren't any in Lisbon also
There's one in Alfragide and one in Loures
There's one right here in Alverca where I live haha
Thought we had more though
I'm wrong after all, we have an AKI and not an IKEA here
Yeah, you just made me visit the website again to check that ahahaha the closest Ikea from you is in Loures
I knew northern europe tended to be racist but I never thought it would be that bad, especially in Sweden and Finland
There's racism here too but not to that extent, except towards romani, /r/portugal is a big racist circlejerk against romani, besides this we tend to be very acceptive
I think Portugal is one of the least racist european countries along with Spain
I usually don't defend Portugal but this is one of the few things  I really love about my country
>except towards romani
It's not toward romani, it's toward ciganos (romani are just lumped in it too since some came in the very last years from central and eastern Europe because "Heh, both are gypsies anyway lel")
But yeah, racism is real against gypsies in Portugal and it's shockingly spread as if it was normal or something
Southern Europe
And western Europe since just about everything is east of us
Mediterranean even though we are not in the Mediterranean, it's mostly because of the lifestyle and dietary
Portugal is southern European and the most western too
I'm Azorean so I'm even more western
I see Portugal as Western Europe, Southern is mostly Mediterranean oriented
Iberians would be one which everyone agrees is right
This is wrong
We never identify with Mediterranean
In our foreign policy the debate is European VS Atlantic
In the sense, should we prioritize Brazil, Angola, etc, the Portuguese speaking world (Community of Portuguese Speaking Nations), and UK (traditional ally)
or Europe and the EU
This is  the real thing that actually exists and it's debated officially
Also, because the Mediterranean trade routes (and Mediterranean people's expansion efforts) did reach our country
There's obviously a very strong Mediterranean cultural element, especially in the South
>Mediterranean even though we are not in the Mediterranean, i
not most people
We are southern europe maybe and western europe maybe, but the mediterranean thing is so stupid
And often people who overstate the similarities really are not very aware of a lot of very specific dissimilarities
Not the only one
Some tourists get surprised every year by that, so,e even die over it by seriously having no ocean sense at all
I should be mad but that's so accurate I can't disagree
If you mean ultramarine territories, not sure they count as EUROPE to be a region of Europe
Also Iceland is not further west than Portugal, sorry
Its westernmost point is east of the Azores and they are all islands anyway
You might want to look at a map mate
[This] informative video might blow your mind then
I get what you're saying, but the Mediterranean influence on Portugal goes quite a bit further
It has been visited and/or settled by numerous Mediterranean civilizations (the Phoenician, Carthaginians , people from North Africa, Romans, and so on)
Mediterranean trade routes by sea reached all the way into Portugal (my hometown was important because it was the last stop on multiple Mediterranean trade routes, as it was the northernmost navigable settlement on the Guadiana River)
Our climate is mostly Mediterranean, and thus we share most of our fauna and flora with the Mediterranean countries
The Algarve has reasonably warm waters, due to Mediterranean influence
Are we geographically in the Mediterranean
Certainly not, but I think there's a good case to affirm that we're more of a Mediterranean people than anything else
The mediterranean has hardly any tides - idiots trying to lay their towel by the waterline and come back a few hours later will be in for a surprise
The mediterranean also has hardly any waves - not such a big deal in summer or in a more sheltered beach but foreigners might have no clue some waves which come really will be bigger than all the others
Tides and waves make for currents
Riptides are particularly dangerous and they might have absolutely no clue what that is
I remember a redditor from IIRC Croatia saying as long as you swam well, you would be fine which is an extremely silly way to think
Then there are people who can look at the damp waterline and walk into caves or other beaches and then be very surprised if the tide is coming in
Our tidal variations is usually on the 2-5 meters depending obviously time of the year and phase of the moon
(On the mainland, it is milder on the islands)
But a lot of foreigners just have no clue at all even about a weak 2 meter tide
You said Iceland
The azores are precisely the same europe as Iceland- peaks of the mid Atlantic ridge peaking out of the ocean, part on the European tectonic plate, part on the North American one, and spreading out apart a few cm a year
If you say Iceland is more western than Portugal, no, because if Iceland counts so do the azores
If islands do not count, we win as well
Nor have I ever been asked to or been with guests that wanted to do so in my house
Hey I may as well ask it here: so there's countries were people take their shoes off, right
What happens when a contractor or a cleaning lady or whoever needs to do a job at your home gets there
Does he take his shoes off too
Here, from my experience and I think everyone I know, it's normal to wear your shoes inside, and it is even considered rude to take them off at someone else's place
Personally I love walking around barefoot, but I know a lot of people who actually hate it
I walk into my room or wherever I've left my slippers and then change, sure
Sweaty feet, down here usually the weather's in the 25-40º range and feet might not smell like roses after a day of walking around in shoes, plus in a dry climate shoes aren't really that dirty aside from dust unless you're wandering around in mud or something
Not really
Maybe in humid climates, but no one likes stinky feet after being in your shoes in 30º+ weather
And shoes generally aren't that dirty unless you've been prancing around in the mud, plus that's why you have a doormat
Because of hot weather
I'm not sure if you realize what 30ºC temperatures are to be saying that
Pretty damn sure your feet have germs too after walking around all day
I don't think it's a good idea to take off my shoes in public, hey
Maybe that's a thing in Iceland, I wouldn't know
Because socks would get dusty
I don't think taking off your shoes when you go to someone's house is what would make a difference in how your feet smell then
Francesinha is the best "poor people food" in my country
[The macdonalds Imperial in Porto] fames itself with being one of the nicest looking macdonalds buildings out there
[The interior] is also kind of fancy
The building used to be an iconic café from the 1930s, that got turned into a macdonalds in 1995
[Here's an article] about the whole thing
It used to be
The [Imperial McDonald's in Porto] is well known for being particularly [beautiful/fancy] On top of that, it's also [located] in the most important avenue of the city (Avenida dos Aliados)
McDonald's being smart by getting a fancy building in each country as a way to attract tourists and get free publicity
well, i haven't seen any portuguese answers yes sooo
im sure every portuguese agrees that pimba basically defines us besides fado
so with that im mind, "Peitos da Cabritinha" - Quim Barreiros
Sorry but my vote goes to "A minha casinha" by Xutos e Pontapés. But I respect your choice XD
Yes it is fairly normal
Duck and rabbits are commonly used in our food, not the most common but still common, they are normally served with rice
Duck, rabbit, normal
Deers
Never heard of
Wild boars
Some people in fact hunt them, but because of diseases and such its rarely eaten
All those kinds of meat are eaten here in Portugal
The most common of the three is duck, as duck rice is a fairly popular dish, but both rabbit and deer are available in supermarkets, and are often a fixture in more rural restaurants in areas known for hunting (like my own), where those meats are locally available
Yes
I was very surprised when I found it is not in other countries
I remember mentioning this to a friend from Brazil and she reacted as if I had eaten a cat and I just thought she was joking
Yeah, it is pretty normal to eat rabbits here
But fish and chips are sort of frowned upon here, people just don't think they mix well
Yes
We have rabbit in almost all supermarkets
Snails, squids and octopus
All that things that makes some outsiders go crazy
I love it all
[Yes and it can be amazing when done properly]
I looove Duck with rice
That's literally the F*CKING BEST
What do you think about Portugal
Do you like living here
Not OP of the comment, but
I love it
Portugal is amazing, the portuguese are amazing
I've been so well received by you guys here
It's been pretty great
Glad you like mate
Cheers mate hope things keep going well for you
I’d say generally speaking you can count on the countries who are historical rivals to be be quite similar to one another
For example, Spain and Portugal
I agree, quite similar
And you are right, most Turks and Greeks don’t accept or even acknowledge that
I guess in the North, in both sides, that’s more accepted
You want to angry every portuguese person on this sub, why
Someone call Padeira de Aljubarrota now
>Spain and Portugal
Portugal and galicia yes, the rest of Spain no
I disagree deeply, and hope wholeheartedly for the Iberian union to never happen again, as it was - indisputably - the worst 60 years in our history by every possible prism imaginable
Death is preferable to be under Spanish rule or any Iberian union
Some might, I am not saying the opposite
I have good Greek friends and only when I place them between a rock and a hard place they will admit it
Spain has a terrible historical rapsheet of not having its' region's best interest at heart, when it comes to decision-making
I have no reasons what-so-ever to believe it would be any different if Portugal were one of those regions
Spain has serious separatist movements with expressive political presence, Portugal doesn't.
Wait a minute
Roberto Begnini is in this movie
I'm in
Their relationship with alcohol is seriously disturbing for something from a southern european country
They are not alone on it, russians as well, and british people all can be very different, but there is this specific moroseness, alcohol on fridays has this specific important place, that it can be really alienating
The danes maybe a little less on this
This is so odd for me
My father saw his parents three/four times a week, minimum
He would either dine or have lunch with them, and on saturdays he would occasionally take them out to the countryside with his brothers for some solo family time
Furthermore we would have a full family meeting every sunday, with all the aunts, uncles, cousins and even family friends
This continued until both of them passed away, I'm happy they never felt lonely
Not really, thankfully there's the etymology of every element's name on the back of my textbook so it's not that bad
Are the regional languages in your country commonly spoken or not
Does the youth speak them
The title says it all really, but I feel I can't leave this part unwritten so here it is
A meaningless text that you wasted time reading
Quite bad
There is only sushi, chinese food, maybe some african and indian food and Italian restaurants are not very common
In Portugal we really like our cuisine, so like 90% of our restaurants serve Portugue food
In Portugal we have it all, kebab shops, Brazilian BBQ, Chinese, Japanese, a few African restaurants like Angola and Cape verde food
This is mostly in Lisbon due to the large amount of foreigners and immigrants, for the rest of the country is mainly traditional portuguese restaurants with some Italians here and there
I'm from Lisbon and there's loads of options for almost every kind of foreign food except African food for some reason
There's a couple places with food from former Portuguese colonies but no Eritrean, Ethipian food which I miss from when I lived in London
Other than that, just where I live I have access (in a 10 minute walk) to Italian, Chinese, Japanese and Mexican food
In bigger cities you get the common ethnic food - chinese, sushi, italian, indian and in Lisbon you have lots of african food shops
In smaller towns, you get the obligatory chinese and that's that
Piri piri is hot spicy used in cousin of  all the PALOP ( português spiking country) .

True, when you start winning we will switch ronaldo for our lord and savior *ÉDER*, and them we will draw that shit
LONG LIVE ÉDER
Exacly, thats why we also need payet to *accidentaly* injure him, its all part of the plan, just like the entirety of 2016 euro was
People usually call it "e comercial", literally "commercial and".
I just call it the "and". I mean, I barely call it anything since I barely see it, I mostly see it on company names and stuff like that
Well I've always heard it pronounced like "e", not like "e" :p
To be fair, Ireland, the island, is *veeery* far way from Britain, so it doesn't really matter much
At least that's what I learnt from this 18th century colonial map
Though I'm supposed to talk about Portugal (since it's the European country I'm from), I *need* to talk about what irks me in Brazilian culture
And that is: the need to be an extrovert and smile all the time
I'm as introverted as someone can get and if there's one thing I hate, is fake smiles and fakeness in social settings in general
I'm more on the side of the Russians on this regard; I value emotional honesty quite a bit
This means that sure, you won't see me smiling and laughing a lot, but when I do, you know I mean it
Same thing with complimenting someone and stuff like that
Bullfights (touradas) it's a medieval disgusting "tradition", it's just stupid that it still exists
Bullfighting
Those weren't drugs
Same here, I think it's very common in all Southern European cultures
Came here to write this
The amount of people in Portugal supporting bullfights is still high, and it makes me embarrassed of being portuguese
I think the numbers are actually decreasing but yes, it's still very high, unfortunately
Too many agro-betos ahhaha
Never happened to me or to anyone I know for that matter
Not at a kebab place (which aren't that common, anyway), but I remember a "witty waiter" telling me something like
> "Oh, you're not meeting your sweetheart today, huh
when I ordered my salad with extra onions, when I was like 15 or 16
I don't think there is a specific reason for being the capital but a combination of many reasons first was an important city in the Roman and Arabian rule of the peninsula
Lisbon is in the centre of the country, it's in the river mouth of the biggest river in Portugal and the hole Iberian Peninsula and it's an estuary so a natural safe harbour
The river is easily navigable and the tejo valley is a very fertile region
This was very important in the pre Industrial Revolution times
I would say it's almost a perfect location if not perfect for a capital city
It was safe for the king to return from Rio de Janeiro, and Lisbon was the biggest city in Portugal and the capital before it was in Rio, so it was an obvious choice
Portugal doesn't actually have a formal capital
Although it has been traditionally Lisbon . It was initially as a way to protect sovereignty in case of invasion
The capital would be wherever the King was
It was rio de janeiro (Brazil) during the French invasion for example
After it was simply never formalized and it became sort of a tradition for it to be this way
I'm Glad you asked: "Estou-me a cagar" lit
I am shitting myself; "Estou-me nas tintas" lit
I am in the paint; "Estou-me a borrifar" Really hard to translate, something like I am sprinkling water on myself; "Estou a marimbar" I am playing a marimba (african musical instrument)
We had some sort of a colony from 1415 to 1999 making us the longest colonial "power" in Europe
Edit: oopsie doopsie I get information from the wrong sources, consider the dates as 1415 to 1975 then
The popular food chain "Nando's" is not Portuguese, the owner is from South Africa
If you wanna eat good chicken in Portugal, try one of the traditional churrasqueiras
No one was calling Macau a colony in the 1990's, it was just an enclave- same as Hong Kong was for Britain
By that token, France would still be a colonial power nowadays due to the french Guyana or Spain due to Melilla or England due to the Falklands
funny language and grandayy
I went there last year, but as a tourist my views are probably skewed
Overall I really liked it
People were friendly and it was easy to communicate because everyone spoke English
The public transportation was also quite good, we never had much trouble going anywhere
I'd say the low points were the traffic, which was a bit chaotic from the airport to Valletta, and the streets which weren't always as clean as they should (but I can't complain too much considering my own country)
I went there during the aftermath of a big scandal involving a journalist who was found dead in weird circumstances (I think that's it
) and there were posters and stuff in some places but it never bothered us too much
Smaller than us, and that's good
Keep it up
Disse íse da uiei da pórtiuguíse accénte úde luque laique ífe uritene da ueie íte íse sepouquéne bai pórtiuguíse pípel
Honestly I probably got the accents wrong
And I had to think for a bit how to write "would" (I chose "úde" as there's no "w" in the Portuguese alphabet)
Dis is de béste subreddit dete ai eve evere sine
Ites sou mache fane raiting dis uei, ai cude nevere guete enafe
Uáte da fóque dide iu djâste faquingue sei abaute mi, iu litâle bíteche
Ai donte noue OP
Hárd tu sei
Tbf that's how a lot of Portuguese people actually say it
Edit: also "uiei" should be "uei", right
One example is Mourinho’s accent, (although it could be a lot worse) specially in his first Chelsea interviews
Another funny example is the portuguese playboy Zezé Camarinha
In my opinion our english accent has a lot of harsh consonants (that thing vs dat ting), and we struggle with things like ‘th’
Yeah that makes more sense
My dad is weird in that he doesn't pronounce the "th" sound as a "d" sound
Rather he pronounces as a sort of "z" or "s" sound, almost like a German would
Not sure why he does that
Some José saramago like "ensaio da cegueira" its really good and really on point now, its about a pandemic blindness and all that it brings
Blindness by Saramago
"On Blindness" by José Saramago is really fitting and is a really great, compelling book
Personally, I would also recommend "The Book of Disquiet" by Fernando Pessoa it's a lifelong work and his life story is really interesting
The way he writes as different people is something uncanny
.Os Maias (the Maias) by Eça de Queiroz (its really good, its about portugueses society in the late 19 century, its a social critic, with themes of nature vs social environment and many more , that has a shocking revelation at the end
.Ensaio sobre a cegueira (blindness) by José Saramago
.Memorial do Convento (Covent memorial) by José Saramago
Oh wow I just picked up another one of his books
Haven't started reading but I picked out of the blue
The boy of the mountain, is it good
It's great, I've only read the first 2
The Baron in the trees is one of my favourite books, it touches in so many topics and ideas
Because Spain is both our ally and our biggest export
Portugal can't take the risk of losing the alliance with Spain, especially after so many centuries of turmoil
And the situation in Catalonia isn't very clear: do all Catalans want independence or just a separatist group
Not really
Even if the turnout was large, the result was 52 to 48%, hardly a clear win
Learning that the verb "to be" is actually actually two verbs with separete meanings in Portuguese, the verbs "ser" and "estar". It also doesn't help that their conjugations are very irregular and difficult overall
I think the same situation happens when trying to learn Spanish or Italian
Coming from Portuguese and English, it's really weird to not need to use the Plusquamperfekt, it actually takes a lot of effort to convince yourself that it's not what you're supposed to use
We actually use "Que tal
" in Portugal too but it's far from being the most standard greeting
Weird how Portugal is so different
Some primary school teachers prefer "tu" but generally you're supposed to address them as "professor/professora" and in third person
I actually remember my teacher teaching us how to address her properly, and she was still in her 20s at the time (late 90s)
Then once you leave primary school, it's not acceptable to say "tu" anymore
In university it's also never acceptable
And the thing is, if a teacher/professor/teaching assistant insists on being called by first name and using "tu", students tend to find it too awkward and don't take up the offer
>Here teachers tend to be closer to the students, you can joke with them as long as you remember they are the authority
dude, you can do that as well even if you are calling them professor and using formal modes
You can do that with just basically everybody, it is not related to using tu or not
In Portugal, no, the default is becoming the third person, with the choice of pronoun used being a subtle meaningful choice
"Tudo bem
" is definitely way more common here too
"Que tal
" is something you'll hear like 5% of the time
We also often say "Então?", usually informally
It literally means something like "so" or "then". You can combine it with the other ones as well: "Então, tudo bem
" or "Então, que tal
To be fair, you guys use tu way more often than us in other social contexts too
For instance, going to a shop and calling the salesperson tu isn't common here
So it makes sense that formal treatment seems harsher than in Portugal
Nonetheless I disagree with u/uyth
There's a bit of a social barrier that's harder to get over when you're in formal terms with a person, in my experience
-inho/inha depending if you are a boy or a girl
many diminutives are also nicknames, specially if you are young
for non diminutive nicknames there's no clear rule
That's also mean saying goodbye to Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp, are we good
Oh fuck yes
Crossing fingers
Adeus
Adiós. Addio
Au revoir
Goodfuckingbye
Aufwiedersehen
Tbh the only reason I still use FB is for the pages and events
Makes organizing something easy
Other than that it's so dull
Don’t forget that Facebook owns instagram and whatsapp
Yes pls
Finally 2020 has something good for us
Before facebook, can they just shut down instagram
I only use it to follow bands, to know when they're releasing new stuff and playing shows
good
Please do
Oh no, what will we do without Facebook
It's not like there are hundreds of other social media platforms where we can make publications, communicate with other users, plan events, and form groups
Them not leaving, and we not budging, means they have to change their regulations
As long as regulators don't back down, we win either way
My reaction as well
Facebook owns Instagram and Whatsapp they're not gonna die
Same in Portugal lol

We should lock this people up in a mental institution, they still believe in imaginary friends
Another day, another misinformed person about what freedom of speech means
Freedom of speech is solely the guarantee that you will not be prosecuted legally by a country's authorities for what you say/write
It means exactly what Macron is saying in the video, that it is not his place as President to stop people from saying what they want
It IS NOT, i repeat, IT IS NOT, the guarantee that what you say/write won't have consequences on your life, like being shunned by acquaintances, lose job opportunities or be denied access to a private platform to say/write your opinions, as long as any of these consequences don't clash with any existing laws
Reddit is an american private company, and you accepted their agreement when you joined the website
These discussions are hosted on their servers, for which they pay money
You have absolutely no rights when it comes to your access to the platform, and if the company refuses to provide you their platform, it's their fucking right
How would that be enforced
I was told only the charger needs to be universal, what about the ports to the phones
Apple can just make a Lightning to USB-C cable and sell it
What will happen when there's a new and better technology
Either everyone changes at the same time or they can't use it
That's actually terrible for development
Great stuff
I feel like electric cars need the same law
Maybe now Apple will stop it's bullshitery
Good

I saw the British Museum in November 2019 and the Greek new museum (sorry forgot its name) January 2020
The Greek ones are complete but they are all copies
The true ones are in London
And yes, i think they should be moved back to Athens but that's beside the point, the point is this meme is fake
> I would love it if I went to a museum in China and saw it full of random British artifacts
I wouldn't. I like it when they are in Europe
>Great Britain and stealing artifacts from all over the world, name a more iconic duo
Dude, try that with a different flair
I have been to Berlin´s museum island actually
Awesome
They sure were trying to give the brits real competition on that
Do not throw stones if you have glass roofs yourself
>Yes truly deplorable, that’s why we have a program and a history of returning artifacts to their rightful owners

The obelisks in the middle of rome, they are there for, you know 1800+ plus years
You guys just lost the receipt in the meanwhile, can anybody prove you did not BUY those
Those obelisks they have been there since roman (ok, ROMAN EMPIRE) times
After a certain point, they will have been there for longer than in the spot the original buyer placed them in

Fucking Trump
When is this circus gonna end
Ok so here is what is going to happen
European "leaders" will say they don't condone this and that, and that they won't support violence or war, they will also say that they hope that peaceful dialogue will take place and everything will be over quickly and in a non-violent democratic way
What will happen is, the US will say something along the lines of "you better be with us in this, or else
", the European leaders will bow down as usual and war "for democracy" will ensue
What's happening
I'm out of the loop i just woke up
Desert Storm 3 : Electric Clusterfuckaroo
Trump is just a symptom of the polarization of American politics
Join to that a systematical glorification of ignorance, a weak social ladder wich causes families to remain poor for generations and complete control of media outlets (fox) by republican politicians (at this point is literally propaganda) and it becomes pretty clear that another "Trumpian" leader will soon follow
Agree, Portugal and Spain should be in charge of the whole world again just like the old times

Reason for failure was two-fold:
- Event was organized by PNR, the extreme right party;
- The event was scheduled after **AN ENTIRE YEAR** of strikes and protests by different sectors (nurses, teachers, railway workers, dock workers, etc)

Every monarchy still standing is an embarrassment to the continent
Well if you want to go by actual power, then she had about as much power as Constantine did throughout his reign
Why are the english so perverted
You act like you wanna fuck this 90 yo woman
well he had a deal with his brother that constantine's children will rule after them so who realy failed was constantine that only had two daughters
> Elizabeth has power, she just chooses to not use it because if she overstepped her bounds that would mean the end of monarchy in Britain
Come now
She doesn't exercise her power for the same reason Constantine didn't, they'd be removed from power if they tried going outside of their limits

Funny thing is Dabra actually becomes a very nice guy later on in  the series

Except for maps about food consumption where Portugal is #1
We knew all along that Portugal is an eastern European country
We into Eastern Europe once more
Actually I would add a "very good results" and put the Nordic countries, Germany and NL in there
Good results we remove Slovenia and Greece and put them into OK results-
Average we remove Turkey and put them into Worrying
Now it's perfect
EDIT:   I made this one, looks better IMO, I would still add some things but it would look too complicated, it's still not too late to invest in Eastern Poland
Slovenia has good results
As a Portuguese citizen: Hey
We're not slightly worse than average all the time
Except Portugal ranks very well in many things that aren't economy related but sure
I would put Spain, Italy and Greece in the okay results
Other than that it looks pretty good
Consumo de tremoços per capita, ninguém nos ganha aí
And weather
Just imagine a little orange area in the black sea attached to Ukraine
Lately Portugal has better results than Italy and Greece (and even Spain)
Actual commentary from 1872 by one of the most famous Portuguese writer and Portuguese Consul to France and the UK:
>*“We are in a comparable, correlated state to Greece: the same poverty, the same political indignity, the same lowness of character, the same public corruption, the same usury, the same spiritual decadence, the same administration with grotesque sloppiness and confusion
In foreign books, in their magazines, when they want to talk of a Christian country that, due to it's progressive decadence, may come to be wiped off the map, Portugal and Greece are mentioned, side by side
Not much has changed
But Greece has good results
That is so true
Polish friends of mine were making fun of us for our "sh" sounds, when they were making exactly the same sounds
Why Spain
Portugal is older and its own language and culture, besides other things
That's just extremely offensive
You wouldn't call a Scot English
> What do you mean remove Slovenia
Unlike all of your dangerous countries, we're an oasis of safety and not exactly behind in anything else noteworthy except size of paycheck
Then we rank Portugal with Nordic countries aswell
3rd safest country in the world, progressive, good climate, infrastructure isn't bad
> noteworthy except size of paycheck
truly Slovenia and Portugal are brothers
I have a a black t-shirt that has written Ljubljana and has a dragon in it
Can you forgive me :(
There's a ton of fair criticisms of Portugal that every portuguese can agree on, but lowness of character
Meh, if you wanna leave your country cuz you selfishly decided you're not good enough to make it better then I agree, you helped solve the problem by leaving
Because Spain is culturally more significant by a huge margin
> I don't see why not
what do you see
Aren't the J proununced like i?

wtf
I had a stroke in my last comment sorry
We've had some in Portugal last month
I see Ireland as the northern Iberia
Great bunch of irelads
Hey, we are great of lads
Made my day
Feels good to be a great lad
At least Portugal can into Balkans
I knew the irish would like us, we're also drunk af and hate the country next door
Mod Brasileiro hue
Vamos dominar a internet ainda
Funnily enough, that's the impression I have from the Irish
Probably because they think that the English are pricks also
You prick :)
Meanwhile in Portugal
Lets raise hybrids taxes
Is this 100% electric only
only cause you guys have money, not cause you're any special
He is probably … Although you guys still polute a lot with the Oil Industry, but who am I to judge
I seriously hate this northern "superiority". No I'm not jealous, it's just that you guys boast about stuff that isn't really fair to compare
Some countries didn't get rich based upon golden eggs they were sitting on
Your "riches" came by chance, otherwise you'd be a shitty county like any other frozen in it's irrelevance
I said IF you didn't have oil, not that you are a "frozen irrelevant country" so
Actual inventiveness and entrepreneurship (plus a state that allows for the free market to breathe)
They have several big multinational corporations
I wish we were more like them
This is so ridiculous it's even funny

Not that bad tho

But
But it was created in Saudi Arabia
I mean, shouldn’t the Portuguese one be the original ?
Does anyone have the full pic for the Portuguese one
I don’t remember seeing it on the sub, but looks great
But the Portugal you selected is not the same listed
This actually heartwarming
Good for Etna, everybody needs to release some pressure before the holidays

These people should all go to prison
Question, is this the LGBT-free zone of Poland
(if I'm not an idiot, I think I remember that there was a zone that the government declared as a zone in which there would only be straight people)
Edit: Hey, I wasn't sure there was a need to say this, but sure, any law/ruling that excludes LGBT people from any civil rights is absolutely BS, and not worthy of being followed
They should be punished as well with their houses burned too
Right wing and religion
It's so opposite to the old red communist image that russian spies are having a free reign field day on this one, even more than in the USA
Well, I'd like to be hopeful about your situation, but if memory serves me right you just had elections, and I'd bet the ruling party will make it as hard as possible to kick them out, so I can't see a path out that doesn't envolve a whole lot of disobedience
Got it, I was wondering if this was hate caused by these flags being in these ridiculous zones, but no, the hate is what caused the zones, not caused by
I've been ranting about this since the beginning of the year, even in Portugal is way too warm for this time of the year
I'm really worried for what this summer is going to be like, I guessing mass drought and scolding temperatures especially in the south
We're fucked
Never saw snow in my life, guess if things get any worse i will probably never will yekes
Every other day here has been basically summer and we're in the middle of winter
Well, we're fucked
There's nothing we can do really
"GloBaL WaRmiNg iSn'T rEaL"
We're gonna have to start reinventing proverbs like "abril, águas mil" and stuff like that
I propose "fevereiro debaixo do sobreiro" for February
As a fellow Portuguese, I don't think our "freezing" qualifies as cold in the rest of Europe
Freezing in Portugal (at least in the south) is temperatures of 15-10 degrees
Because this comes at a cost, these temperatures are an indication that the Southern European countries will suffer greatly (dryer weather, decrease of rain, worse fires, etc you know climate change)
Germany is doing long term shit now with the EU and global warming
Don't know what "south" you live in but in the Alentejo you get temps close to 0 often in the winter
Portimão. As south as you can go I guess
I know
And empathise with them because at the end of the day it's not a individual national problem but an international crisis that will affect mankind and will disproportionately affect countries with weak to average economic strength
So yh i know
The coast in the Algarve is really different in terms of climate
The rest of the southern region doesn't enjoy its temperate climate :)
I've lived in the Minho, center and southern regions of the country
The coldest I've ever been was in a "aguas-furtadas" apartment in Lisbon
The humidity gets to you like no other type of cold
And the summers were hell as well

That moment when  I just saw this exact same post on Facebook as soon as I entered Reddit and my brain went like : hold on, haven't we been here before
it breaks my heart that there is not more people caring about eastern europe
it's 2018, the rest of Europe (and the world for that matter) just don't care at all
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes
Elect stupid politicians, get stupid laws
Will this lead to Orbán losing reelection
This is why people need to have weapons
you vote in a fascist, you get chocolats
I am here to say it is the commoner's responsibility that allows retarded ideas to be put into practice
We don't take the time to know Who these people are before they take office
More over, we keep voting out of ignorance for possibly another rather ignorant and insensitive person
It is the responsibility of the voter to know what is to be expected with their vote, not only by itself, but also globaly
We have to demand better politicians and we can only do it by knowing more
We have to demand ourselves to know more and respect what has been achieved throughout this millenia
Yep, not a sigle revolution has ever been successful without the support of the military

Beautiful city
I was there in February and i wish it had snow
Amazing
Expecting to visit again in the near future
Lisbon just woke up this morning to the first <15c morning
I've been in Prague three or four years ago in December's first week
Really loved the city, instantly became one of my favourites european capitals but I didn't got the full snow package
Now I want to complaint to someone
I'll be moving to Prague next month, just hope there will be snow then, I've never seen that much IRL
My Portuguese ass is going to freeze but I'm going to love it
Oh yes that's true
It's pretty to see when you're inside the house ahahah
100% worth the visit
[It does]
well that is a statesman
Good luck
I mean
what are we supposed to do about it
It's a totalitarian state, it's what's expected
Step 1) Transform into a Union of States
Step 2) Become as self-dependent as possible
Step 3) Along with any other democracies that want to go along with it, stop trading with authoritarian countries
That means China, Russia, maybe the US depending on how it runs itself
Well, russian meddling in the 2016 US election might have made democracy stronger in 2021

BASH THE FASH
No surprises here
Expecting the french to make something right was always a delusion
"and still support us in time of need"
Like destabilizing Lybia
The amount of EU apologetics here is breathtaking
Instructions unclear, spent all the money in highways and German cars, now the train infrastructure is fucked
What do
Not relevant for me
Even high speed train, only Spain would be halfway at a comfortable time scale comparable to plane travelling
And for 5% of our population plane travel is absolutely essential, vital even
Trains are no replacement for plane travel for us
Well, the way things are going (plane tickets getting cheaper) I don't see how that will happen unless they COMPLETELY change the entire system because no one is going to pay more (and when I say more I mean a LOT more) to go by train and take 10x more time to reach the destination
I take the bus and the train every day within the country but the country is tiny and the tickets cheap but if I go somewhere else it's much cheaper and faster to take the plane
I for one see this as a good thing
A lot
A racist County
Thought racism in America would be like in Europe, a bunch of little cowards behind a screen acting racist, a shitty ass minority, but no
Black people were fucking hanged on trees are u kidding me
3rd world country
Good Portugal and denmark
Good
After two survey :
Portugal : We want more European integration and fuck the US ! (and probably fuck Bolsonaro too if they asked)
I get that all of the last USA presidencies have been awful in so many ways, but the overall European "superior" attitude towards them is so elitist and smug that it just doesn't help towards unity between allies
If Europe ever gets invaded don't ask for the amercians help again
Late 2000s was probably when the shift started, after 9-11 most Europeans were in favor of helping the US in the Middle East but as the war continued and America's motives became more clear it was hard to stay on their side
Yep, plenty of people like Trump outside the US and firmly believe he's a great president
But they made it easier to spot who pays no attention to their own national politics and just watches right wing youtube videos
The only dichotomy in their head is liberal/left -- conservative/right
There are still people living like this today in certain parts of the world, not because there is not enough food, but because there are people at the top who wish it to be like that
Please do not forget them
And dont assume that just because it isn't happening to people who "look" like you, that it isn't important
EU just voted to have organizations who help refugees and migrants who die in the Mediterranean to be able to be criminalized
It is now a crime to help these people
The far right celebrated this in the eu assembly
Yeah, good news
Best of luck
Let's see what this leads to, hopefully not another dictator or a power vacuum
It has begun
Ah, that one
After a little shallow digging, found out that it's organized by right wing extremists
Just check their profiles and see what kind of pages they Like: Escudo Identitário, Chega, PNR, the whole lot
There are people really willing to seed chaos, so they can harvest something from it
And it's not necessarily the same thing we seek for
Sure, people can't be angry unless the bad people tell them to
Macron is a very good president with very high approval ratings, and wasn't at all elected to prevent the fascist from gaining power
I mean the guys who created the event
I have friends sharing it who are proper left wing, without even releasing what they going for
>who is doing what he promised to do
What
The protests are not about that
My dude, nothing you say changes the fact that the people screaming Russia at any point in time really need a scapegoat for their actions
Russia isn't the problem, neoliberalism is
People are sick of politicians sucking up to the big guys, so of course they're gonna break shit
Maybe division and chaos is what's missing when a democratically elected leader constantly screws over their constituency
Yes, outside of Portugal that might be true
Here, not so much
For the good or the worst, PCP controls the street movements and they’re in bed with the government
All these strikes are just a proof of life, and trying to take away the majority from PS in next year’s elections
16 journalists is 16 too many
To me those guys from catalunya might qualify as well
They were setenced because of political reasons
crimes of sedition
are those not political
I don't care if catalunya stays a part of spain or not
Sedition laws exist to maintain the status quo
My point is that these crimes are political in nature
> Anything can be political under the right circumstances, even having an abortion
Don't deflect
Sedition crimes are always political in nature
No need for a special context

> How does it relate to the map though

It might be just a show rn, but it gives strenght to the movement, which might one day transform into something greater
This does not apply to Lisbon in many, many ways
Doesn't apply to Lisbon for sure
Doesn't really apply for Portugal
Jokes on you, our Avenue is a WW**I** Memorial
LOL, not mine
That's because Tejo is too large
Porto on the other hand
We don't have a WW II avenue
I specified Lisbon didn't I? And the title specifies capitals, which Porto is not
Also, most bars in Porto are also on the north side in Ribeira
On the other hand we may have something about the WW I or Colonial War in our cities
Oh yeah
What Riverside bars do you have on the south side of Tejo
Chill dude, I was just trying to say that, while it doesn't apply to every city, it applies to a lot of them
And obviously it's not exactly like in the map, maybe like 70%. And no, it doesn't specify capitals
Dude, it's just a cartoon

Why is this posted in Europe
Trump goes down as the most insane president I ever seen, and this included a lot of dictators, they are usually ruteless but not this insane
The comedy aspect will be missed
It's a small relief, although it looks like interesting scenes will still come between now and the inauguration
Nonetheless, Europe has an opportunity here to grow it's image
I'm tired of seeing top talent leaving to the US preaching freedom and "the greatest democracy in the world" where nearly half of the votes practically don't count and a presidential candidate with 3% or 4 million more votes is quite close of not being elected, and only called 4 days after the elections
Don't get me started on all the bipartisanship, gerrymandering and all the sneaky political shananigans
(Not saying we don't have our problems)
haha
nice analogy
He has more than 4 million votes than Trump on the popular vote alone, and will probably have over 300 electoral votes, not that thinny
Tiny was Bush v Gore in 2000
This is why I'm so happy
I wish we didn't have to care about the US elections (specially when so many Europeans don't really care about our own systems and European elections) but the truth is that culturally it carries great importance into our borders
Trump was the fire stoking all of the far right rising we've been seeing
They were always here, but never as confident to show their ugly heads
Hopefully things will be able to improve now
But not by themselves, we still need to actively fight these fuckers
We were all thinking it
He has immense political experience and history to back him up as someone who has amazing negotiation skills with him opponents and a deep understanding of minority social issues
I can't stand when people just call him a traditional white old man politician
He is a lot more than that
That is a dumb reason
This is not Europe related, this sub should focus more on european information

No no they where all brought in from Western Europe to protest, like 50 thousand people just arrived out of nowhere in Belarus

Our forest is fake
it's basically plantations of eucaliptus and pine trees to be turned into paper
Our native forest is gone as long with animals that lived there exept in very few natural reserves
No wonder we have huge fires every few years (and more eucaliptus are planted back afterwards)
Damn it's actually impressive to me how wrong our perception is
I've been all over most of those countries and seeing those 30 something % on Luxembourg (around the same as most of the other countries around) made me go "that can't be right", because if you travel around Luxembourg there's forest everywhere, hell the area of the capital city is around 20% forest and driving on the national routes (not highways) between population centers is always done though thick forests
I would have totally said it was like 60% at least
But yeah, that's why we need factual data
Reading the comments from people of places with high percentages is  making me uneasy
There's a tingling in my butt
I want out of here
Unfortunately my country burns up every summer
Our forest is a sham
Plantations of fast growing eucaliptus only useful to make paper
No animals can live there
Maybe Koalas could
Eucalyptus grows back fast
No, now bugger off to your sub

I really dont understand the obsession of putting the LGBT flag everywhere
It does nothing of value and only creates the idea that LGBT are a bunch of fanatics going around putting flags like any other low level vandalism
I thought the idea was to be seen as equal to other citizens
Maybe I'm stupid and the way forward truly is to antagonize a country thats not really into you even more
Poland called Lgbt people inhumane and there were violent protests against lgbt people

Just here to point out the Poland and Hungary are both extremely conservative, and their governments' ideas are closer to Trump's America
We would look more to ourselves, than comparing to these ones that have nothing to do with
Ironic of Portugal to think the US is broken, while we keep getting to the worst place among Europe
I'd love to know the ages of people who participated because I don't know a lot of olders folks outside of academia in Portugal who understand the American political system, let alone be able to judge it
How the fuck does it not work
Portugal :D
This life expectancy graph according to wealth explains it:
Where does the money go, US
It's telling when the only two countries who give a somewhat positive rating to the US political system are Hungary and Poland, the two EU countries that take undemocratic actions and who blackmailed the EU over rule of law
This isn’t referring to what people vote on, but to the political system itself
In fact, if people want to vote conservative, they should be able to, and their vote should count
Thing is, I don't see the Dems being unreasonable, they seem willing to compromise (within limits), while Republicans seem to disregard their own ideology (i.e. they weren't opposition, they are contrarians) and as example, they declined to confirm judge Garland back in 2016 saying Obama was in the lame duck period, and Lindsey Graham even said he would do the same if in 4 years there was a Republican sitting president and a new supreme judge vacancy open up
Lo and behold, 4 years later they do have a new nomination for a judge in the supreme court, with a Republican sitting president, and now he isn't a lame duck anymore
Another example, debt and being fiscal responsible
They berated Obama's expenditure, and then went and indebted US more than ever before, while making the US less capable of paying such debt with their fiscal policies
So sure, it is polarized but it's because the Republicans became a caricature of themselves and don't stand for anything anymore
Their unofficial motto became: we're not the Dems
and we're not GOP either

This phenomena is aptly called (the science of) Dehumanization  this is exactly what  the Nazis did, as the article explains, plenty more and its a long tradition in human history, even before they had a name for it
This is evil and messed up
From another article,  "Two forms of experienced dehumanization were apparent
In one, a failure to recognize the target's equal status is associated with aversive self-awareness and feelings of shame and guilt
In the other, a failure to recognize the target's basic existence as a person is associated with cognitive deconstructive states and feelings of sadness and anger

You are VASTLY over estimating christians there, m8 (politically, of course, a lot of people will have some kind of religion but it will have no impact at all on their political vies)
The Portuguese one, that usually gets around 5-10%, defends North Korea and other communist dictatorships
While currently they're more about party guided syndicalism and hard socialism you can be sure they would go back to their communist roots if they had enough votes
Fortunately younger people don't vote for them and they mostly get their votes from the older people in the southern rural areas
So the party will probably be reduced to insignificance in a few decades
Our Prime-Minister is fearmongering about a "impasse à espanhola" (translation not needed I think), if BE (left-wing party like Podemos) gains too much power in the next election
This is why that's not really a concern
The problem isn't that Podemos has too much power, it's that in Spain there isn't yet a culture of coalition building among the political parties, while in Portugal coalition governments (or pacts to support the government as of right now) are not unusual

Greece surrendered to Germany in WW2 but refused to surrender to Italy because Greece humiliated them
EDIT: For more context, Greece's military was small compared to Italy's and Mussolini thought it would be an easy conquest
Not only did his invasion fail, Greece was actively winning while outnumbered, humiliating them
In the end, Germany had to come and win the war for them and Greece only surrendered to Germany
Mussolini was so bad at war it's astounding
He made the trains run on time and the military really inefficient and badly supplied
Clearly the problem lies with the faces
Bodies are on point though

Brits use the fascists when necessary (Farage being an example) but they actually don't give them power, with guys like Farage and Rees-Mogg, who are right-wing hardliners actually being insulted quite often
Same reason why Corbyn was never going to be elected, Brits have a hard time with hardliners
Boris, May and Cameron were all conservatives but none of them were hardliners, two of them were pro-EU and the other supported abortion and gay marriage

>	I worked at NeXT the summer of 94
I was in the break room with 2 colleagues when Jobs walked in and started making a bagel
We were sitting at a table eating ours when he out of the blue asked us "Who is the most powerful person in the world
"  I said Mandela since I had just been there as an international observer for the elections
In his confident fashion he stated "NO
you are all wrong
the most powerful person in the world is the story teller
" At this point I was thinking to myself "Steve, I love you but there is a fine line between genius and loco
and I think I am witnessing this right now". Steve continued, "The storyteller sets the vision, values and agenda of an entire generation that is to come and Disney has a monopoly on the storyteller business
You know what
I am tired of that bullshit, I am going to be the next storyteller"  and he walked out with his bagel

Sry, basicaly what was 50 escudos became 50 cents of the new euro, equivalent to 100 escudos, exactly the double
1euro = 200 escudos
1st January 2001
1 Deutsche Mark = 1 Euro,
1 Euro = 200 Escudos (previous portuguese currency),
1 coffee 50 Escudos = 0
50 Euro ?????? ,
But yeah, literally prices mostly doubled overnight on everyday stuff in Portugal when we adopted the Euro
Like the freezing point of brine is relevant at all lol
0 should be the freezing point of water, nobody gives a fuck about brine
lol a "fat" day, as if I need one of those to eat all the shit I want
After eating these  "Berliner" all over europe I have to say the pączek Polish version is so far the worse of them
I got to try their many flavours of fillings, from famous bakeries, but was always left disapointed as they were all pretty bad (like just poor tasting chocolate fillings or a synthetic/fake strawberry jam taste)
The best ones are found in Portugal "Bolas de Berlim" with the filling of "creme pasteleiro", they are like a massive step above in the tier of berliners
That looks weirdly like a Berlin ball, a portuguese sweet
And i'm not sure when we celebrate Fat Tuesday
This looks like the Portuguese Bola de Berlim, which I had never seen outside of Portugal before
Ah, the Bola de Berlim salesmen at the beach

what are you Brits doing in Portugal
we already have enough homicides for CMTV to handle
We're thinking about each other, obviously
Haaaai, let's meet up
I think there is a mistake
Portuguese people don't kill other people
I believe I can explain the situation
It is a translation mistake meaning people were searching "como matar sem ser apanhado" which it can also be translated as "How to get away with murder" the series, it was popular in 2016
Don't worry we aint weird
\*looks at body collection in the basement\*. Portugal is safe :D
So is anyone going to answer my question or so I have to google it again
As a portuguese, linda i. Guess, but i would be better off without seeing this
Yes, all good around here
Had no idea that was Portugal's most how do I question
Actually now that I think about it almost every day there is someone on the news that got killed
Damn Russia is so philosophical
I now get why germans so often seem serious/unemotional

As a Portuguese, feeling quite unease regarding our fellow tourists from now on
Guess we now know what happened to Maddie
Nah, it's us, those brits are really annoying with their "tourism", we just leave those searches open on public computers so that they stay on their toes
You can't even write "how do I" in Portuguese without sounding like a moron, since the "do I" part will go directly in the verb that follows, so
Is it the brexit visa requirements or the corpses under the red sand
The activities of the brits checks out here as well spaniard
Seems they might be doing the murdering and the eating in different places

Climate change: this ain't even my final form
I mean
I would actually appreciate a bit of heat over here (north of Portugal) - weather hasn't gone anywhere upwards of 25º. It's fucking end of July and I'm still leaving in the morning with a pair of jeans and a jacket
Summer has not started over here lol
Its raining where im at
Should be a lot worst
So ppl can take climate change seriously
Portugal good
Once again, another heat wave that doesn't mess with Portugal
As a Portuguese living in Glasgow
This kinda feels like home
IT'S A LIE
Aaah you northerners and your low heat tolerance
*Laughs in high temperatures*
It's raining right now
Oddly enough, here in Portugal, we're having a somewhat moderate summer

Portugal is not Burning ? thats a first

Well

Pfffff weaklings, every summer it's always the same 40C here and in Spain
>Folks, dehydration is no joke
dehydration is not the only problem strong heat can cause
I think people who are not used to the heat can be a bit too wishful thinking that drinking water or using sunscreen is enough
dehydration is not the only problem cause by the sun
You can drink lots of water and still suffer heat stroke
The best, foremost advice is to respect the heat, and change routine as necessary, to protect oneself
Do not exert yourself needlessly (sports, or working outside
if working conditions are unbearable
Drinking water, and upping mineral consumotion (sports drinks, salty food, and supplements) helps but it is stupid to drinking water a is a magical shield against the heat
it is not, you can overheat, you get exhausted very fast, you can loose the ability to regulate temperature
Most private homes in Portugal don't have AC either
Idk why suddenly no one realizes that and thinks this is relevant *now*
What do you say about Christmas in the beach
It would be relevant if it was Winter season
But hey, every year, same old shit
I suppose people were slow with realizing what's climate change and now they are lost
Completly lost, lol
Dunno about that

Removing space from cars and not having an real alternative is not a good thing
FYI catching 2-3 public transports and wasting the more time on them is not an alternative
Just as the rest of Europe
but hey
it's a sidewalk that will be barely used
They did the same with bike lanes in Lisbon, for over a year I saw less than 50 People in total using them
Cars are not the enemy
Poor infrastructure is the problem
That's great and all but it's a pain for car users as they will have to park further away from their homes
I feel like there'd be less complaints if there were viable alternatives
For instance my town in Portugal is doing this kind of renewal to move cars away from the city
But at the same time, there are less bus routes than 20 years ago (and population is going up, not down, so it's not like it's a desertifying zone), and public transport inside the town is a joke
In big cities with developed or developing public transport networks these kind of changes make perfect sense, but it's not a one size fits all kind of solution
[people like the ex PM of Malaysia support such acts]
It's about time to stop this all-welcomed bullshit
Islam, at least the way it's interpreted nowadays, is not compatible with western ways
Come to Europe, live according to our ways and laws
Don't like them, get the fuck out
I really dont get France's posture, act tough and challenging to terrorism but do very little to stop it, of course this was bound to happen, the surprise will be if we dont get another bunch of attacks soon
How the people in France arent up in arms with this government is beyond me, though it explains the state of the EU in many ways
France seems to be the center of these attacks now
I've been saying it for years, religions are the most idiotic, stupid, useless thing mankind has ever created
And no, you don't get to say yours is better, Catholics burned people, started the crusades to kill the infidels at the behest of the Pope and financed by the Church
So much suffering and deaths for imaginary friends someone made up to control the masses
I just hope they only killed and made wars among themselves
Downvote me i don't care
here we go again
The problem is clear but no one will do anything about it
Stay strong, you have an amazing country
France is EU's beacon regarding freedom
*Europe
Caling for genocide isn't cute, you child
Ban Islam
Equate it to problem ideologies like Nazism, Anarchism and Communism
It is a first step for truly tackling the issue
I really shouldn't get more into this
But hatred generated hatred
I care as much about who started it as with 2 small kids fighting
And what about the church telling people not to hear condoms in Africa and aids exploded
What about the same sex weddings
Seriously I don't care, I couldn't care less about religion any religion
Most just cause hatred, misery, wars, suffering
So discussing one or another is not my point
We're not evolving

That's why I corrected you, you posted cringe

Although I just find it annoying if nothing else
And there is barely an acceptable word to describe "Americans" or united stadiens of america
Now we are left with a word that means someone from anywhere south to north
Although I think people get the shorthand and don't conflate the two :)

What different opinions have people in Russia about him ? He is not consensual as a rising star against Putin ?
He's a right wing nationalist but far better when it comes to free speech/democracy stuff than Putin
Obviously he is not unanimously popular
I mean he has a very good amount of followers on social networks such as Twitter and YouTube it's the best modern way to make opposition
I truly thought he was "the man that Putin feared the most" like a read in an article some time ago
In many ways its healthy being this way

A lot of European countries have a problem similar to the one happening in the US, whereas not many countries risk a foreign invasion (the closest is Ukraine and nobody seems to really care anymore)

Wanna race with our Naus
If that is sailing towards me, we're going to have trouble again, and you will lose again
Release the [botafogo]
Another ship pops up, I'm getting the caravel
Whose
They could be if this was an Europa Universalis IV game
Aren't these quite ineffective
Don't get me wrong, they look like a great ideia, but do they work
Thanks for all the work and effort lads
Happy 2021
You might as well be shooting an Archduke if you are just going to throw around fighting words like that
Hey look its the daily the democratic elected president of Poland is a clown thread
Are you expecting the left to handle actual real social issues that affect the majority of the population
Calm down there that might make them win elections
Things like this makes me want to believe hell is real
Portugal does not need any extra requirements, we were doing quite well and improving our situation pre covid, we were slowly improving from a financial crisis that was not our fault but still exploded our country because we were left alone by the EU
If that happened again we would be completely fucked, we lost 10%+ of GDP in a couple of months from something totally outside of our control, we just need help getting to the other side of it and not be abandoned again, after that if we keep going at the same pace as before covid we will keep slowly improving our fiscal and economical situation
we will let slide your children coming to portugal and spreading disease and chaos like they have been since the start of summer
when you start taxing foreign corps higher as they should, maybe we'll respect you more
Finally
The perfect example that shows that immigration policy matters
Good on Poland dont fall into this trap
You can take them from the empire but can't take the empire from them
Ok just cut the country in half already
Why though
Denser than some big cities for sure
We know a thing or two about [building too close]
Belgians or Germans
First Poland now the Pool
This doesn't bode well for me
Probably Eden Hazard family
Deutschland Deutschland über alles
Über alles in der Welt
or or
i like the german anthem
I'm not even german
I don't believe you
If any foreigner would throw a Portuguese flag into the pool I would be pissed
But of he was Portuguese, sure, don't give a fuck
i prefer the old one
it had more power into the singing
i prefer the old one
That if a foreigner would dare touch any form of the American flag to disrespect it, you wouldn't care
which part is
i know it is really intense, but has nothing wrong on it whatsoever
no it isn't. just way too patriotic
Blood of those who fight for the freedom
i see the rat leaving the bus
And Tuga
Great bunch of lads
Looks like they built a damn good simulator
The diagram isn't wrong really
Common Travel Agreement are domestic laws not enshrined in official treaties and the chart is about official de jure status not de facto status otherwise Andorra and co would be in the Eurozone
Are you sure about Andorra
I think they do border checks
I asked you what was wrong and you ignored that because you have no answer lol
You can answer comments that aren't questions you know
Luckier than Laika
Damn they really just threw anything they had in there
You know your house is shitty when flies prefer to leave it rather than a capsule where they have to share some tiny space with a cat, rats and fungi
Well, would you look at that, Estonia can into nordics
And they ignored the danes
We also use the Greek expression in Portugal "Isso para mim é grego
" Although less commonly nowadays
Me, a railway enthusiast: I'm moving to Germany with immediate effect
Yap, even at [OPs source] it has both "This is Chinese to me" and "This is Greek to me" for Portugal
atleast he didn't say it sounded Spanish :)
Yeah, we've disliked talking about anything related to Greece since the Euro 2004 final
Podes dizer caralho, nós deixamos :)
Hahaha true
estás a ver-te grego como o caralho
Looks like something out of Skyrim
This looks like it's going to take off at any minute  and summon the God of Creation

We won't back down
Good luck chumps

Can someone compile a list of who were the fuckers who approved this
I want them jobless after the next elections
And the vote was forced by UKIP and other MEPS using the rules of procedures otherwise it would have gone through on the nod last year
Remember that
Once the UK is out, you won't even hear about these changes
To the surprise of no one
All bought and paid for
Really
I have
They aren't they are just corrupted
And you just know that our government is gonna implement the worst possible version of the directive given how shitty they are
Going to be impossible to browse the web in Portugal without VPN and even then
Here's a short summary of what protesting achieves:
fuckall
I understand how the EU works
Unelected officials proposed the laws
Elected officials vote on if the law should pass or not
You have no controll over it since when you voted you had no idea what was their stance on an issue that didn't exist yet
True, this will be disastrous, and I don't think our government will try to stop it at all
I'm not sure of the results this time around
But I do know that only two Portuguese MEPs had voted against the directive before this stage, which is shameful
Marisa Matias (BE) and Francisco Assis (PS)
Assis' position is particularly brave because he was the only MEP to oppose the directive in his own (Portuguese) party
Marisa Matias I'm absolutely certain that voted against, because she had pledged to do it and actively campaigned against this bullshit directive
News flash - The actual United Kingdom is not the entity typing on this account
Oh yeah I forgot about that but you know what VPNs say: This is America
Swedes have some really neat small touches on their products
From the tiny swedish flag sewn on the driver´s seat of most Volvos to pretty much all of their Ikea stuff
Swedish design has great attention to detail
Rotate the thermometer
Boom, 32°C and lots of heat
Winter is no more
No need to thank me
It's 14º here and yet, I'm complaining about how uncomfortable this cold temperature is
holy
The lowest temperature I've ever experienced was like -2° lmao, Portuguese guy here
Most of Portuguese
Summertime
Yeah, but I am in the middle of winter
Walking barefoot inside the house > wool socks
It is the right temperature for you to get toasty
Easy
Just put the map of australia on the house and it will rotate on its own
"watch how one person ended climate change in just one move"
Sorry sir, but we don't do that here
Isn’t it summer/autumn in the Southern Hemisphere and therefore Australia
Actually had more than that a couple of days ago
Currently is raining and we are at 15°C
Hate to be that guy but technically you can't be in contravention of a provision about *definitions
* Perhaps article 6 or the one about profiling is more appropriate, maybe check with the Lapland supervisory authority
Consent needs to be specific and mustn't be assumed
In essence you'd have to state in your letter to Santa that you allow your personal data to be collected, processed, plus Santa would need to inform you about your rights, his purpose for processing data, his identity, etc
Therefore the lack of consent would need another legitimate ground for processing, like the contract basis or Article 6 (f) for legitimate interests of Santa
He certainly needs to clarify if the profiling amounts to automated decision-making
E.g. is it made through Christmas magic/algorithms, are there deep-learning elves involved
Additionally, Santa's main public is made of children under 16, who have an extra layer of protection in certain aspects
Get your things together, Santa
When I was in Madrid, a local told me: what you'll see in every street is both a peluqueria and a place with jamon
I never forgot, and it never fails
But yes, jamon, it is an art and the spaniards have quite perfected it
I like it too much
Jamon
Presunto, caralho
Nice presunto
Arms usually cost less than legs

You're better of buying hash if you're in the South
Spanish & Portuguese hams > Italian hams
*pata negra has entered the chat*
Portuguese: ahah look how cute they are ! You are both winners in my heart
I hope one day to go to Croatia and eat it
That guy makes me want to punch him and I'm not even Spanish
I'm told up in the north and basque areas is where you eat the best in spain
As a Portuguese, I have to say that our Presunto (at least where my parents are from) is similar to San Daniele and I prefer it that way
Taste the meat, not the grease
Oh yeah and Italian Speck needs more love
It's underrated
People who don't live here probably
Good weed is expensive af compared to hash here, that's just how it is
It's also really hard to find
my thoughts exactly
we're still in 2020 :/
2 because of Azores
I, too, haven't stepped on a bathtub since 2019

2021 has to be better than this shit show right
please tell me it's going to be ok
I live in lisbon, and i have around 50 ping to frankfurt, and 120 to new york

When you talk about deciding your own fate and forgot you are deciding the fate  of others that then will also want to decide their fate
Closemindedness
Weird bikes you guys got there
Looks like everyday Portugal
That's normal
what was even the point in the lockdowns in march if we ended up here in October not caring anymore
Wow another comparison graph with america
How original and relevant in an **European** subreddit
I would dare say the Americans are massively underreporting cases
A lot more deaths being reported than usual in this time of the year, even without the pandemic's death toll
Portugal: Hold my Super Bock
Looks like England is the S.
Holy crap that's bigger than I expected (yes thats what she said
Yes please
Then I can go there by car instead of wasting 1000 euros on a fucking plain ticket
I need to go and come back so, thats 1100
Make up your mind Sweden
>If you don't like that, I suggest you never go visit the concentration camps in real life
I think everyone should visit a concentration camp at least once in their lives

Belarus goes from happy moustache to slightly unhappy moustache to sad moustache
Ashamed that I never heard of the Belarusian president, what can anyone tell me about him
(that an Internet search won't)
Still, his mustache remains glorious
Because Russia in fact BAD
I have a message for all the luso-french people on here:
I have heard that a large ammount of you are Lepen supporters
Don't forget to ask portuguese people in england how they are treated now vs how they were treated before brexit
Please consider that before voting, instead of just voting for her just out of spite for the eu
I can't read haikus now if it isn't with the jacksfilms' little jingle
Omg we should def remain now lulz
Regardless, this picture was taken before the pandemic had happened
**Bald and bankrupt entered the chat**
Portuguese here
Can't relate
Not in Portugal . maybe in the 90
We've decided to screw over our trains instead because fuck poor people who need to get to work
Got some very nice roads though
I believe this is for motorways
We have amazing highways here but they better be for the price the cost
National roads
I find it hard to believe that Portugal is that high tbh
Weird, I've never actually seen Trump smile like that, it caught me off guard
Fake, the girl isn't 2 meters tall
Portuguese Lofi  btw you are talented for this
Well, even PIS supporters know the public TV became a shit show
It targets older people, and those will vote PIS regardless

How do you guys survive if you need to come to Iberia
That's hilarious
Why call him Vasco da gama
Finally Portugal not being Baltic
It's not gay, it's same sex marriage
Us bisexuals are part of it too
In any case, i thought Germany did NOT have same-sex marriage
Does anybody know current gay divorce rates
Portugal has an history of being fairly progressive when it comes to LGBT rights
We were the eight in the world to recognize same-sex marriage and we're one of the very few countries to recognise a non-binary/third gender
We also recently allowed same-sex adoption and medically assisted reproduction for same-sex couples
When you take into consideration other things such as our stance with drugs and (hopefully soon) euthanasia, I think it's fair to say that Portugal is one of the most progressive countries when it comes to social issues
FYI portugal was the first country in the world to abolish the death penalty and the second in the world to abolish slavery
We just passed euthanasia
We were among the first countries in the world to pass same sex civil unions and then same sex marriage
We are an example on decriminalization of drugs
Portugal has always been at the vanguard of human rights
I don't understand how you can even think something less so, much less the opposite
There is more salt in the Mediterranean though
Only 19 for opp-sex
I thought it was much higher
Wondering whether compatibility in same-sex marriages ended up being better
I mean after all that struggle to marry, if everybody started divorcing it'd be a shame
Brazil has been independent for a very long time

23°C in Porto
I'm currently wearing a coat
Edit: Weather alert
It is now 27 °C, I  have taken off my coat
Why did you brake your pen
Sunday is going to be 38 is Madrid and Berlin, and just 22 here in Porto
the Atlantic Ocean is depressed, even here in Lisbon we had lower than usual temperatures, and
water
that fell from the sky a few days back, go figure
But all is OK from tomorrow onwards it's back to business as usual, drought and 35°C and more
Edit: close all windows and shades during day, open everything at night stay in the dark and hydrate
Good luck
That moment when all of Europe is melting and we are complaining that it's too cold
You should have come to Portugal, then
People are still wearing coats here
21°C is completely bearable
I feel you
That's our average spring day
I'm cold
and it's a spring coat, it's not very thick
Oh my sweet Winter child
I'm wearing a coat right now
Yes, and probably for a big part of europeans tbf
It must be bad for those who love far up in the north ofcourse
Pretty much, yes
It's 23 °C here
With 19 °C I would be wearing pants, a coat and a long sleeve shirt
That's our average spring day
I had to work in a office with 40 °C because the AC was broken, now that is hell
On the other hand, we're not used to the cold
With negative temperatures, we won't even leave the house
Finish coffee is so shit, the only thing good about finland are the fins

When you go gung-ho with your enemies and you wait for them to call your bluff
What the first one doesn’t show is that they call dinner to lunch on the north
That confused the hell out of me when I first arrived
Based on this and this alone, if I were to move to England (a country that I've never been to) I think I'd move to either Somerset, Dorset, Sussex, Surrey, Berkshire or London
England looks like a cat from behind
I am so unused to see non uk england lol, where's the hat
I was not choosing under those terms,  but if so, it's great
Ilham Tohti, the guy that prompted up the 2009 Urumqi riots consisting of hunting down and killing 150 Chinese nationals with support of RFA, so so sad
People here are more used to the perpetual "bomb method" of dealing with Jihadists, rehabilitation can only mean Nazi extermination camps
Never seen this one, pretty good, thanks
Gonna have to try your luck somewhere else though, people here only know to bomb Jihadists far far away

> The rioting was sparked by allegations of sexual assault on Han women by Uyghurs, and rumours of an incident in which two female Han workers were sexually assaulted by six Uyghur co-workers at the factory, according to Voice of America
The authorities said that the rumours were false, and had been initiated by a disgruntled former co-worker

China imposed child limits within it's own majority ethnicity and minorities were exempted from the One-Child policy for many years
> The policy also allowed exceptions for some other groups, including ethnic minorities
Thus, the term "one-child policy" has been called a "misnomer", because for nearly 30 of the 36 years that it existed (1979–2015), about half of all parents in China were allowed to have a second child
Also try to not base your opinion on the "research" of someone that considers himself in a mission led by God against China, that calls gender equality, homosexuality and bans on corporal punishment the Antichrist and is an advisor at a Theology college
Usually not a great idea
> Zenz is a born-again Christian
He stated that he feels "led by God" in his mission
> With Marlon S. Sias, Zenz co-authored the book Worthy to Escape: Why All Believers Will Not Be Raptured Before the Tribulation which links modern trends, including gender equality, homosexuality and bans on corporal punishment, to the power of the Antichrist
It's the Falun Gong all over again
A bunch of homophobic, sexist nutjobs that believe that aliens rule the world, who run propaganda campaigns through their media outlets, yet the moment they claimed "China is stealing organs" no one doubted of their claims
The most ironic part is that some Uyghur separatist movements have been labelled as terrorist groups by the United Nations and U.S. Department of State (since they have a history of terrorist attacks in chinese soil), but people act that the chinese government picks minorities at random to oppress
I did Syria
Always liked this flag
And apparently that's what the flag is supposed to symbolise

Not to take away from the message, but are the EU contribution amounts adjusted for inflation
You can't put a price on xenophobia can you
wtf poland
Wtf Poland
Portugal is an hilarious roller coaster
Yh kinda surprising, i thought you guys were better than Portugal in terms of renewable energy
Not really
Their share should be higher, but the high population density and land flatness doesn't help
Offshore wind is an option but they are just next to some of the busiest maritime lanes in the world, so it's also limited
Either way, they can and should improve
Why not solar or wind
The EU isn't the world police
Belarus isn't even a member lol
I'm half-Scottish and usually go there at least once a year for a couple of weeks to see my mum's side of the family
One thing I always found shocking was the incredible amount of sweets, crisps and snacks in supermarkets
When I was a kid I loved it, but nowadays I think it's crazy
Having spent last year living in Scotland I also noticed just how bad a lot of people's eating habits are over there
~~Portugal~~ Spain can into Eastern Europe
They eat reasonable, small portions, and varied food
I think it is not so much what you eat, but how much you eat
Also they drink moderately, and beer bellies are not a stereotype without good reason
The things is Italians probably don't drink 1L of coke each meal and they usually eat smaller portions with salads and have a more balanced diet
Their traditional desserts are very very rich in sugar, and oil
They use a lot of fats in cooking as well
Also and I think this always the most important factor, portion size
If you eat lots of healthy natural food, you will still get fat
If you eat little of unhealthy food, you might not be healthy but likely you will be thin
Such an underated comment ahahahha
What about all those flavored pellegrinos
Those have a ton of sugar
Idk how popular they are over there though but the Italian restaurant I used to go to (tons of immigrants there), id see them knocking those back all the time
All I'm saying is that I noticed a lot of empty cans of Irn-Bru lying about the streets
But I actually fell into some bad habits myself
There was many a time I'd get the Tesco meal deal for 3£ and get a Monster as my drink, not because I wanted or needed it, but because it was such a steal
Definitely put on a little weight last year
Been there three times and I agree
But I was more surprised at the types of medicine they sold in drug stores
That's why exchange of cultures is so important
You guys pick up the original recipe of Italians and perfected it with the Peepza
Im the only one who thought this was a dick joke
Better than the abortion that Norman Foster shared
You do understand that it was a joke right
If Norman Foster makes a proposal I think it's going to be bolder than just changing the burnt sections with glass
And do you have any serious source for this
Because an unsourced image from a tweet doesn't look official
I'm gonna share some personal experience to give some perspective
A few months ago I got curious about this very topic on the lines of "how can someone believe this
" and did some research on what kind of arguments were used to deny the holocaust
I was expecting some weird lunacy conspiracy yet I was surprised with how compelling some of the arguments were
For example, one used was "All the death camps were liberated by the soviets so much of the initial info comes from the USSR
Do you trust the USSR
" among other such as historical documents/testimonies that go against the "official" version or questioning the logistics of how the millions of bodies were disposed of
These were surprisingly effective at raising doubts about certain aspects of the holocaust
The real issue that I found it that if start questioning some facts (which even I did) it is really hard to actually get answers to those questions
Even if you start questioning in 100% good faith just to fact check you will easily be labelled as a stupid nazi denier
I'm not a denier, the holocaust happened and there is ample evidence of a genocide effort on behalf of the nazis against the jewish communities (among others) of Europe
However, I think there is some public shaming about questioning some facts and logistics around it that actually help grow the number of holocaust deniers
Just my 2 cents on the issue that I thought would contribute to the discussion
I hate it here on earth
Wow really what the fuck
Far-right resurgence
The big one was that all the extermination camps being liberated by the Soviets put the info around them into question
I'm not 100% sure on this so correct me but for the first year after liberation do we have info about these camps from a non soviet source
This was doubly weird for me since I know of some massacres that the soviets tried to pin on the nazis such as the mass shooting of polish officers
I didn't start to question whether the camps existed
They were there and had the specific purpose of extermination but I started wondering if some details were exaggerated by the soviets or not
That was the main one to me at least but I probably should research the topic a bit more to come to more accurate conclusions
Assuming they did a good job at picking people
That's very cool
I don't really know how it works but it's interesting
I guess choosing randomly is not so simple though
At least in my head
If they choose 1000 random people in Milan for example it's not going to be representative of the whole Italy
And maybe even in Milan they happened to choose "randomly" people near an area of a certain demography, the results might not even represent Milan
As a portuguese i find this weird, if it is below 30° it's a bad beach day ahaha
Ironically, here in the south is colder than usually
GIVE US OUR WARMTH BACK
IS THE ONLY THING WE HAVE !
Wait
28 is too hot
What temperatures do you get in the summer
Still fresh spring here, wtf
Gib summer, Finland, you can handle the cold
18c here
Going to Finland next month, i hope the heat keeps building up
How are your beaches
Portuguese here, i use t shirts only, only if temeperature is above 24/25 degrees
The cold temeperatures aren't that big of a deal, you can always wear more jackets lol
Did you die from hypothermia
Nordic countries are not used to hot climates so 28°C is a lot for them
Where are you going
Lisbon
If yes its always around 35°C more or less
It's hot, but not that much when compared to other places
Also, the fact that you have 15 degrees in summer blows my mind, like
Do you even go to the beach
28-30 degrees is a heat wave
What
Weather has been crazy
We had a couple of days some weeks ago where the temperature reached 25 but it has been rainy and cloudy ever since, though I think they are starting to go up now
We've been getting around 20 degrees in my city and we call that cold, especially of you go out
What temperatures do you get in the winter
I sure am
Idanha à Nova, near my "roots", ay
Gets extremely hot in the summer, and rather cold in the winter
The average peak day is like 41/42, but expect at least 35C. Have fun
Wow idanha a nova is extremely hot in the summer you are gonna melt ahahah
Its 25 degrees today and i am still wearing a jacket xD i dont know how you do that
I know, it's just weird to think about it because I've never been in contact with that  kind of thing
I was thinking it would be lower, because of all the snow and stuff

Don't know their sources
But I do imagine borders are all well documented and categorized
It's [3,2 meters] long
If you're talking about [this one] it looks about 3 times longer
**shakes fist in portuguese* *
Where exactly is it
TBH, the drama has all been coming from people who don't know shit about nuclear and just whine "muh radiatshon". If you dump radioactive waste on the bottom of a pool you can swim in it and be fine, so long you don't come within 1-2 meters of the bottom of the pool
I'd rather the spanish bury nuclear residue close to our border than dump an equivalent amount of CO2 into the atmosphere
That being said, I don't know how versed are the Spanish in infrastructural safety
* Oliven**ç**a
The issue isn't that the deposit is going to cause issues
The problem is that the nuclear power plant that creates the waste that gets deposited there is old and has safety issues, and that by creating this deposit they will use it as an excuse to keep it in operation far into the future
Then why don't the Spanish dump that shit in the middle of their country
Portugal doesn't use nuclear energy and shouldn't be punished if the Spanish have a problem with their nuclear energy
Because
1) Spain can bury whatever the fuck they want in their territory, even if it's 1km from the Border and isn't anything illegal
2) The guy above just explained if stored properly Nuclear waste isn't detrimental to human health, which the spaniards were more than happy to comply with the Portuguese requirements
This kind of decision isn't made like Zé of the Tasca, it probably goes more deep and has more variables to it than "VAMONOS JODER LOS PORTUGUESES JEJEJEJE"  or "ENTAO METAM LA NA TERRA DELES PÁ"
Nah it isn't detrimental to human health, that's why there are so many people living in Fukushima/Chernobyl right
Reddit has a huge boner for nuclear energy but doesn't realize that it is dangerous
if you lived near the border would you like to know that there is a nuclear waste dump outside of your house
Would you like to know that there is a nuclear powerplant running for 20 years more than what was planned to do
And he didn't explain shit he said, didn't explain
Sorry Georgians but I don't like it

But until now it's much better then the trio of complete idiots, trump, putin and Boris
In almost every country, the current government always tries to keep the last government's commitments in terms of foreign policy, even if they would have done differently
In my country the two biggest parties agree almost completely on foreign policy, so it's not even an issue
In the US, the current administration actively works to destroy everything the last one has achieved
And it's likely the next one will do the same to this one
And it also clearly shows that the untrustworthiness of the USA is due to Trump
And that Boris Johnson dropped UK's.
Ya okay NL

This yielded over 25 million euros to the Dutch Tax Authority in the period between 2012 and 2019, NOS reports based on annual reports of the Dutch subsidiary - Google Netherlands Holdings B.V. - and figures from the Dutch Chamber of Commerce

Its really not
The EU is just another head bigger than the others
It's not good values though
Have you read the title
Happy independence day Україна! Much love from Portugal
Job well done as far as I'm concerned
It would insult Portuguese more if you wrote brazil
Me very angery
Good job
Wars have started for much less
aaand of course the joke about Portugal is that it is part of spain ;-;
It's
Always
the
same
damn
joke
No one hates Iberians more than Iberians themselves
Damn Iberians ruined Iberia
Deves querer apanhar, bandido
You monster
You fucking removed Portugal
We didn't even get a small piece of territory
T R I G G E R E D
Dude if you let the map like this but gave northen ireland to england tou would cause souble the damage and bonus if u added a bit more to it
I’m sweating
- It's time for a fucking crusade
How is this offensive to Spain
They gained the Portuguese territory which everyone knows its the best in Europe
Its a win for them
King D. Afonso Henriques didnt beat his mother for this, may the re conquest begin
As a portuguese I can say that you did a really good job
What's the french insult
BTW:Wai te vuder ó espertalhão dum Carvalho
Vai para o caralho
As a Portuguese, go fuck yourself
Yes, I do feel insulted
Good job
Not pictured: Iceland --> USA
You made 2 subs angry actually
r/PORTUGALCARALHO
Estamos aí caralho
They made the right choice
Looks a lot like current traffic in Vietnam
I have a friend (from Portugal) who went to the UK, rented a car at the airport and, just a few meters ahead, went right on a roundabout and crashed with another car
Also Forza Horizon 3, damn aussies
the content id system is utter garbage you can use only copyright free music and some copyright troll will flag you anyway
Sony already hitting on a bach biopic, if they fail they will probably loan him to disney like spider man
This saddens me to a whole new level, as a music lover, a J. S. Bach fan, and as a European
YouTube has several copyright options even with copyright claims
The owner can just claim as revenue to request removal
This mean that all ad revenue could go to Sony for all those uploads
"We must endure minor discomfort in silence
What a waste of gas
But congrats tho
All this post-brexit freedom is lifting us higher and higher
But wait
what is this humidity I feel
(dissolves into rain)
At this point brexit is more than annoying
Yes I do support what this woman said and fully believe that what the UK is doing is stupid, and that the tactics use in the referendum were at best in bad faith and at worst lying propaganda that should have never happened
Has fellow European and Portuguese and a law student i must say this just get this shit show over, be it cancelling of brexit or a brexit actually happening, and UK citizens don't desperate if brexit happens because the Lisbon treatie doesn't forbids ex members from joining the EU so think very well in the next election if brexit does happen because this show could be stop from continuing to exist and stop some of the damage already done by then, don't vote with your ideology in mind but with your brain for the best solution
Man I feel bad for the Scotts, they never asked for this
Do the right thing and have another referendum for fucks sake
I would vote for her
leave wouldn't win if everyone had all the facts :)
It wouldn't be the same vote though, it wouldn't just be leave or stay, it would be this deal or stay, now that people how the country can actually leave, all the things that will change they have the right to decide since they were told something very different
> Who says that
Anyone with two brain cells
> The deal was already rejected
by the UK parliment, if they are pressured by the people to accept, they will, the EU will accept it
> Slovenians were told something very different, you dont see us moning about redoing the Yugoslavia referendum
Ok, cool, you do understand that one of those has already been implemented and the other hasn't right
May presented her deal three times, it's not that much of an issue plus art
50 can be revoked if they wish
Ok, but that's also why a second refferendum is important
If the people vote in favor of this deal, any polititian who then votes against it in Parliment commits pollitical suicide
Article 50 wasn't voted in parliment, you might be thinking of the House of Lords
Ok, I'm not gonna deny that, I don't remember, it's been a while, I still doubt most politicians would go against the will of the people
Oh, I wouldn't say that
Can think of a few examples that prove Russians are quite capable changing things when they really want/have to
What is the source for the 6
6 million from China
> Much like Italy, Austria, and every EU and NATO member state to their east, Serbia is part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative
While the Chinese are economically active in Serbia, their investments are, in reality, mostly loans and remain clustered around several specific projects
Of the $2
2 billion that has entered Serbia from China, almost two-thirds are loans and only one-fourth, or $561 million, actual investments
This image is comparing apples to oranges
It's comparing what people see as foreign investments ("aid") to actual aid in economic terms
Hence why Serbians see China and Russia as giving the most "aid" in the form of investments while neither of them are on the economical aid side
And considering China has loaned/invested 2
2 billion in Serbia and the EU 1
819 billion the percentages make much more sense
A sub always praising to be against propaganda and immune to it falls for RadioFreeEurope and RadioLiberty which are news agencies funded by the US Government
ELI5 the chances of Serbia joining the EU
What about Kosovo
Now I can't stop thinking about those awful EU video competitions
They try and that makes it even worse
Because being surrounded by healthy economies improves the EU's economy as well
I hear you
Same thing but with Spain over here
> The problem is that they don't really improve their economy with it
It just disappears in all the pockets on the way to its intended destination
That's not true
Corruption is a thing, but it's far from as effective as you think, especially because there are measures taken to counter it
We hate Spain, but we love Spain, though
Pity about the weather though
I loved the irony of these news pieces

Brotherhood at its finest
Tourism can be both good and bad
It helps bring in money, but can also end up shaping a place until it becomes dependant on it
But even for places that rely on tourism overtourism can be a problem, as it can put pressure on infrastructure, lead to an increase in litter and pollution, drive property prices up, etc
You shouldn't feel bad in being a tourist
A lot of us enjoy travelling and visiting new places
But it's important to be a responsible tourist
Do some research on the place you plan on visiting, see to it that you aren't contributing to any of the problems that arise from tourism there
And also shop local
It's important to help local businesses and services, as that way you're ensuring money goes to the residents of those places
There should be a subreddit for people that get the Portuguese flag right
I was sort of expecting the Brazilian flag there
Portugal and Poland "Po" friends for life

Fun architectural fact: Venice is entirely built on underwater wooden pillars that remain untouched since the city was built
Since oxygen does not reach that wood, there is no risk of the city collapising

Everyone just kept going as if nothing happened wtf is this
I mean if Putin says the election was not faked he surely is telling the truth
He as to be since he as experience on that
I mean, I'm not going to pretend like I would try to pull a super hero move, I would be scared shitless aswell, what suprises me is how everyone just goes on with their lifes like nothing happened, not even a stare or suprised look
> It seems like you can't really achieve change just by peacefully protesting and letting yourself be beaten
You only found that now
Yeah, a longer version of the video would be nice
Another non-violent way would be to somehow convince a majority of the army's officers to form a coup
Although I'm guessing that the army is probably pro-russia
I'm sincerely sorry for your country and it's people
Hope you can fight back and go on to better times
Portugal is just a fusion between the Mediterranean and Eastern Europe at this point
Since we are talking physics and innuendo, theres the opposing force, "Better have one bird in your hand than two flying (away)" edit: and yet another east european/portuguese similarity, wtf
Now we’re not even waiting more than a couple of months to report stuff
Come on, this sub can do better lol
Translating: Matar dois coelhos de uma cajadada
Can't into space if you kill everything that flies
Well, the economic and social indicator maps are similar because Portugal is less developed than its closest neighbors, so it's not a coincidence more than it is a consequence of a lack of development
Everything else is probably a huge coincidence, including the phonology of the languages being similar and the fact that we say rabbits in this case
The "tea" map is definitely a coincidence, since Slavic countries say the word from Iranian influence and Portuguese say the word from Cantonese influence because we went directly to the source
It just so happens that Iranians probably got their word for tea from the Cantonese too
I don't think there's been any significant cultural exchanges between Slavic countries and Portugal throughout its history, with maybe the exception of a moderate Ukrainian immigration in the last 30 years
Portuguese culture is heavily influenced by Spanish, French and English culture, as well as the African and South American ex colonies
A lot of it comes from being far away from the centre of Europe, which has the biggest population density and where a lot of things spread outwards from
As for language sound, I once read that the stereotypical "Slavic" sound is a fairly conservative one from PIE, so maybe we kept it as well
Hard to tell because we had a lot of influences in our language, but we've never been anything but the fringe of each invading civilization group, so maybe influence wasn't as strong
We certainly have very conservative aspects when comparing to romance countries
But it might just be a lot of confirmation bias at this point
> at this point this can't be a coincidence
It’s not
It’s due to confirmation bias
We also say one with flies tho
I think it is "Killed 7 flies with one blow"
The connection wasn’t that
Portugal got *chá* directly from the Mandarin word spoken in court due to it’s direct trade connections with China
The rest of Western Europe got it from Dutch, who got it from Malay, who got it from South China’s Amoy word
Radical changes happen, but people still jaywalk in front of moving vehicle and bikes instead of waiting for them to pass
Lisbon, Praça do Comércio:

Lots of places in Lisbon have been improved for cycling too
Narrowing roads when it's possible and making way for people and cyclepaths

Taking your ball and going home is so cool
Even so, here you're only required to have your identification card and a certificate of approval (a small blue brochure-like paper which also doubles as a temporary driving permit, valid for 60 days after you pass your drivings exam)
During those 60 days you go to the IMT (authority regulating transportation), and they file in your details with your identification card and your certificate
2 weeks later, you get your driver's licence in the mail
the europeans used to buy it before brexit
but nowadays there are all these rules for export that need to be followed that were always in place for countries outside the EU, but that the brexit loonies insist were just made up in the last month by the EU just to be mean

The British media has some shared responsibility for this has well from what i was told
I just hope you guys can rejoin us in a close future :')

I am Portuguese and live in Spain, so I know a bit of both
I may be very wrong, but I get the impression that a lot of Spanish unemployment are people who actually do work, but do so without paying taxes (for example a cleaning lady that does not generate an invoice)
So they're actually counting people who work as unemployed
Otoh, Portugal has been gaming the statistics since ~2006
There are state run employment centers
The only people that count as unemployment are the ones that are registered and actively seeking employment through there (which is mandatory to receive unemployment benefits), but since then you stop receiving benefits after a couple of years and those people just stop going to the employment center
Don't count the unemployed people
These are misleading numbers
It's before the European debt crisis

If americans worried more about food quality and taste, maybe they would not have a food trade deficit
Made in America is not actually a sign of quality for the consumer is it
In which products would it be valued, bourbon, hot sauces maybe
I was browsing through some (rather good) american foodie magazines the other day (Saveur, Bon Appétit)
The EU pays for ads there about whether something is produced in the EU
And that is very ingrained in european consumers, that we think that if something is produced here it will be healthier and/or tastier

History repeats itself etc, etc
So we've got a proto-dictator to the East in Turkey, preventing them from joining the EU
Then fucking nazis enter the Austrian government, so now we're again afraid something bad's going to happen
And fucking Poland goes and gets a government in place that looks like they behave like NK and they want to leave the EU, bringing more into question about its stability
A broken EU is bad for many reasons
You could even say they have been about the only thing keeping countries in the continent from going to war with each other again, not to say provide a measure of economic stability
This is bad

Portugal at 10th
What a joke
The Prime-Minister threatens to fire journalists and pressures the TV networks to stop airing news pieces that are prejudicial against the governments image, especially regarding the 2017 fires
This is a FUCKING JOKE
The Portuguese government just paid 15M to several main news outlets a couple of months ago with the excuse of the COVID
They even had the brother, the cousin and the best friend of the prime minister ruling all 3 major channels, until his cousin was forced to quit her job because she was censoring news about the corruption in the government
News independency in Portugal is reaching dictatorship levels
The local press here in Portugal like to stir the pot with their freedom
Especially in small town tragedy/accidents and football
Some channel's (even they're on-the-scene reporters) will openly mock people/clubs
*cough* **cmtv** *cough*
In Portugal the press is free if you want to write socialist bullcrap
I discovered how great Portugal press was once i saw how biased were other countries like USA
I would like to let people be aware that our government bribed the media with 15 million euros during the lockdown
Being from Portugal and living in Bulgaria for 10 months I really feel the difference even without being able to read local newspapers, especially in the way pandemic was handled here vs what I hear from friends back home
We are always either nordic gang or east gang ahah
Don't you mean Malta, not Cyprus
Source would be great
It seems weird that CMTV, SABADO, Publico, and other newspapers and news organizations would love to make a big coverage about it
From what I could understand this is the feedback provided by organizations of each country and also taking in considerations laws and crimes against journalist
That's some solid, out-of-the-ass, evidence
Not to mention that our Prime-Minister had family members in positions of influence in the main TV networks (including the public-owned one)
Some fresh air would be nice
Has been 35ºC for the past two weeks, and it's going to continue to be for a while

2021 has been a shit year to be \[insert nationality here\] with an expired passport

Embassy is a joke
I don't get how I can request an Id online and get it in 1 week, but can't do it for a passport
Why aren't the same level countries ranked by name instead of a random mixture
nice
We are home boys
It would be fun to see this with the total population of the countries (if someone decides to do it, don't forget to add the countries' own population to the total, to account for large population countries)
I needed a passport to enter Russia on a visa-free ferry (I was in Finland at the time), and I went to the embassy in Helsinki
They told me to set up an appointment online
I sent them an email doing exactly that, and they ghosted me
Then I sent a second email, this time to a different address in case I got the first one wrong
Ghosted again
How fun
Needless to say, I didn't go to Russia
The cute version of operation barbarossa
They've ghosted me too a few times
I usualy have a better time when my wonderful wife talks to them
These embassy guys have a seamingly easy life
To be fair I don't know what they do when their public hours are over - 9 to 12 in Dublin - but it's kind of frustrating dealing with them and not understanding how busy (or unbusy) they are
I might be wrong, but I'm under the impression that UK or Irish citizens can have and keep both passports
Portugal is the same, the country accepts citizens with multiple passports
I don't know if that applies to everyone in Europe though
Ah I see what you mean
Good point
I believe you could be able to ask for a new passport and keep the older one until it expires
I don't remember having to hand it over last time, but that was a long time ago
Never forget
How did soviets treat the liberated prisioners
I know quite a bit about the eastern front but not about this in particular
The USSR wasn't exactly the most kind of states but I can see them using the liberation as anti nazi propaganda as well at the time

seems too high in some countries, even Portugal, does this keep track of official residences
because if so it's very likely that they just leave earlier, but the official residence it's still their parents home for convenience (my case at least, since i've been renting rooms/apartments since i left home at 18)
Oh god
Spoiler, I guess
In Portugal, people can't afford a simple funeral, let alone leave their parents
I've been working since I turned 18 (just turned 25 a few months ago) and I am about to finish my dissertation and get my Master's diploma
In all those years, I barely managed to save any money, because every job available is an extremely low paid one
It doesn't even cross my mind leaving my parents' house any time soon, especially when rents in Lisbon are higher than Queen Elizabeth's life expectancy
Fucking hell i had no idea portugal's was that high
All I see is the warmer the country, the more people can be outside of it and the more you can tolerate living your parents
If I was stuck inside in a snowstorm for 17 years id probably want to leave ASAP
Definitely, yes
Youth unemployment, and also most jobs created on the last 10 years or so are really precarious and underpaid
All while rents are getting higher and higher (at least in Lisbon, where I live)
I'd say this is the main reason why some people only leave their parents home in their late 20s.
Then there's also the cultural factor: in Mediterranean counties it's common to only leave your family home if you're getting married or moving in with a partner

We use the expression "até dói nos ossos", that translates to "even hurts your bones
I’ll remember next time I see BiH
Your bitchiness sucked but you taught me something
If it wasn’t for the bitchiness I would probably forget
Yes, that's the main argument for going the other way around, but I didn't want to focus on a negative aspect
I didn’t understand it even after looking it up  maybe I’m just dumb
Aww just like WW2
The Germans are so witty hahah
Hmm I don't remember being there
And it’s one of the most beautiful places in the world, not physically (although it’s not that bad in that sense), but symbolically
Free to be thrown off a cliff by the tories
>Op's post was about distinguishing *flags* of the Ottoman Empire and Turkey

ah yes, those [easily distinguishable flags]

Not to be confused with the dutchie, which you have to pass on the left hand side
Forever in our hearts, rest in peace legend
gigachad didn't die though
Cries in Northern Portuguese
ah, ok, my country is ded
Poor Portugal
Next time you make a post, include some sort of description about what we're looking at
Pretty colors don't mean anything without data
Hmmm
Portugal in the graph is definitely wrong
“Porto” for example, arguably the most developed city in the whole country, is marked as red in the map
The whole country in general is too red, and, if by means of comparison, anything would be considered to be “transitioning”, it would most definitely not be the south ... Trust me, I live there
This map is about money
not development
Portugal into
do your thing guys
I don't understand how Algarve is a transition area but North Portugal is underdeveloped
Oh Poland
My husband is from there
I actually feel like many things are similar in the countries, in the many visits I've had there
Seems it is because we are the butts of Europe
The north interior is a lot poorer than Algarve, if it was only Porto metropolitan area it would be blue
I think it's really easy to understand
It's the same for central Portugal if was divided in interior and costal the latter would probably be yellow
Yes it can
If the German is anywhere south of Switzerland it will look red as a lobster, making it seem that there is no suncream in Germany
The same thing applies for the British tourists
In fact, we call the British "bifes" (steak/meat) because they turn red like meat when they "grill" their bodies in the sun
Absolutely barbaric
Maybe I did not make myself clear
They are red like raw meat and lie there as if they are beefs being cooked in the sun
Please keep it up, good work, i want to see how this looks like in the end, BTW Could you please also do the islands (like Madeira, Açores, canary islands etc
Or are just doing main land
Cool
Only khlav kalash
This is bond to confuse some people
Edit: My misspell makes it even better
Half of them aren’t using masks, and those who are have it below the nose
They don't make'em like that anymore

Lisbon sidewalks are all made with that stone, and it rains quite a bit more in Portugal
And Lisbon is full of hills
So imagine that
Some brave women walk around wearing high heels
Nah, we're good in our rectangle
We will only hit them with bread shovels if they try to take our rectangle
The problem with invading Spain is that it's full of Spaniards
(It's a joke guys)
Oh no, they're onto us
España? No
Los azuelejos fueron usado por los Moros, que copiaron las mosaicas Romanas (Byzantinas)
Pero quien los hacen mejor son los portugueses :\]
>Some brave women walk around wearing high heels
To be fair, they are usually foreigners and they only do it once or twice
I have seen one, going down Calçada do Sacramento where her partner walked a step down, she gripped his shoulder and took a step down very very carefully
And a few other instances
Locals do not do it - also locals tend to have different legs and cardio ability, and well different asses, crude but true
The calve muscles are even more obvious though
Fliflops also, tourists also do that a lot
I have seen a few which busted the strap and walking barefoot or hobbling
Really stupid, flipflops on hills with calçada, locals do not do that
I tried to do a quick google search and all I could find is that a king of ours visited Sevilla where he saw azulejos for the first time
He liked it so much, he brought the trend back to Portugal
This was in 1498
Don't know if Sevilla was already Spanish or not, my history is lacking
Definitely
Caralho, filho
Deixa uns sobreviventes, pelo menos
They were heroes, who fought, and in some cases died, for freedom
What they're saying is, you can either do whatever you want to your money, or come hat in hand asking for corporate welfare and state help
Not both
Exactly how it applies is open to question, of course
This measure should come with provisions for just those cases - like you paid early, ok you get help, but the time period is also extended
There is also a particular onus of management here: the company has not enough money in reserve because it gave it away
Maybe a measure to limit bonuses and dividends unless the company has say x months of operating money on hand would not be unwise
Note: this would only affect those who need money
So again, it is the responsibility of the private managers to decide how to manage
But the moment they ask for the public for help, they must accept impositions and costs
Otherwise, don't come for it
That's crazy
Lisbon has 353 hours in July, and I always complain when it's cloudy
But how do you have 17 hours of daylight
That's 7 hours of nighttime
I love EdinBUROUGH
That's cool, I didn't know that
Ain't that Reinhardt from Overwatch though
Damn my head is spinning
My head is usually used to working during the day
With daylight savings and all, I never go to work, or leave it, when it's night
I definitely need to spend some time there, to check how it feels
That ain't it chief
Hot weather and cold drinks is my kind of thing
You dare say cold is better than hot weather
YOU MUST ~~have a cold heart~~
️️ how can someone like both cold and hot weather
You're not human
We need to study you
Weather bipolarity
Maybe you are the Pinnacle of human evolution, you adapt to the different weather
You should spread your genes as much as you can
The opposite actually happens
If you spend enough time on a boat (let's say 16 hours a day for a couple of days) on calm waters you start to get used to the rocking of the boat (or house)
When you get back to land you get landsick (same symptoms of seasickness) and it takes a while until you regain your balance
I never experienced landsickness for more than a week, but I could feel it getting weaker every day
I'm guessing even the most sensitive would take no more than a month getting used to it
Assuming it's a gentle rocking of course
This is what I want
An army of mercenaries who do not belong of any EU country that follows whatever Germany wants
I mean what could possibly go wrong
What is the goal
Defending from bankrupt Russia
Attacking the middle east
Going to Africa
Maybe it's to remind it's ex-nation states to not play brexit again
Fuck off
Yes, this is what I want, an army of mercenaries who follow the orders of the leaders of the EU lmao
What a brilliant idea
European living in Texas
This chart made me feel really homesick
And why are we comparing ourselves with one of the worst examples
Only the strong survive
Darwin approach
Well, it really depends on where you live
I'm in Houston and Houston is an extremely diverse city with people from all over the world
However I fell that everyone is living within they're own community
It's a big city and everything is spread out, it's hard to walk somewhere hence you need to have a car to go everywhere, on the bright side there's tons of space, houses are big and bars and restaurants as well, there's never an extremely busy place with lines like it was in Madrid where I lived before
People are nice here although they are very kept to themselves and it's hard to make friends, my impression of the Americans is that they live very busy lives and don't have much room for new friends and any new relationships
The few Americans I know is because they don't have many friends and I am starting to realize that there many lonely people on this city
People live a very polarized life nowadays here, and it comes to a point where even this pandamic became extremely political
You wear a mask if you are Democrat and not if you are Republican
And that comes to another point that I feel about the way Americans think, people see things in a very binary way
Either blue or red, either white or black, there's no space for grey or to have a  middle ground position
Whilst I feel in Europe people have a deeper knowledge in polítical, social and economical matters and have less (yet maybe) less polarized opinions
One of the things I love here is nature, the natural parks are absolutely incredible, and nothing nothing in Europe comes close to the beauty of the parks here
I've visited Grand Canyon, Antílope, Yosemite, Sequoias and monument valley and I can assure it's absolutely mind blowing
Next week we're going to Big Bend here in Texas and later this year Yellowstone
Funny thing is none of my American friends have visited any of the parks, for them what's exciting is visiting the old and cultured cities in Europe
Makes sense
To conclude, I like living here but can't see my self living here for ever, in March 2021 will be two years and I could stay one more, however that should be  time to get back to Europe
It's for sure an interesting and rewarding experience to live here as an European
imagine calling the USA not developed, must be pretty sad having a non-developed country having large number of troops in your country :/
> excess deaths is by far the most accurate statistic we have at the moment
Not exactly
Portugal for example had a streak of untimely cold weather right at the start of the quarantine and those usually also make the number of deaths rise
When is the 2nd vote happening
Why aren’t they on opposite sides of the screen
/r/mildlyinfuriating
that looks amazing, but
internet
I can’t begin to understand how bad it must be to live in a climate like that
We were all cold as balls here in Portugal this weekend with snow on some high places, but I’ve already enjoyed my daily dosage of direct sun to te face today and left my coat at home also, I think us southerners wouldn’t last long there :/
Hang on there buddy
yeah we dont have anything like that here, during the winter we just turn our heaters up and grab blankets, and keep in mind that's with like 5\~10ºC
Yeah, we are not used to that, here in Lisbon usually when it drops bellow 15ºC people start using scarfs and coats
But on the other end we really love our 30ºC days, witch I bet would be the end of times there eheh
President of Portugal taking a selfie
Taking selfies is this man's part-time job
Even while on vacation, he spends half his time talking to the press and the other half taking selfies and giving people advice
Even Mr pres gets more chicks than I do
We call it a Marcelfie
For the people talking about their age: it's a fucking photo mate
With the fucking president
Chill
O rei delas
Noooo they're not social distancing
Dude's an absolute baller
If Marcelo can do it, so can you
É por isso que sou português caralho
Dude, he does BTS scenes
Time to go back to work you don't have the banks and TAP to lick the ass
Go Waste my Money as always
You forgot about the hugs
Never forget the hugs
Everyone can tell it's Marcelo
Like how the president is the only one wearing a mask and maintaining distance
Pretty sure it was the other way around and that is not his phone
It is basically a meme right now to ask the president for a selfie
Everyone tries to take a selfie with him
Even I have tried
There's a running joke that at this point, most Portuguese have a selfie with the Professor
They asked
He might legit be one of the people with the most selfies with different people in the world
He does this everyday multiple times per day there are people that go a beach that usually goes to with the intention of getting a selfie with him
Nah, they look like rich Lisboners
They are not fat enough for that
No every girl can be Frau Farbissina
They look like girls from Cascais specifically, I can hear their Linha accent through the picture
You know what
Having travelled quite a bit in Europe, especially the Mediterranean basin, the people I found who looked more like us Portuguese outside Portugal were the Turks of the Aegean coast
They looked more like your typical Portuguese than the Spaniards do, which I found pretty odd
Nah, the light skinned and blonde girls look either foreign or a mix of foreign and portuguese
The rest look Portuguese
Look, he that most of all, more than the girls
Verdade
All of them
> But there are LOADS AND LOADS of Turks who look like White Europeans
Oh I know, when I was in Istanbul I saw everything, from Turks that looked like your stereotypical Middle Easterners to other Turks who looked stereotypically Irish, see through pale skin and the reddest of hairs
It felt like half of Eurasia had made it's way there
He is the most queque of all queques
Bless him
We do not mind
And since he is so queque he surely was not the one suggesting the selfie, we know
Somebody might have called him "tio" during this pic though
Surely several of those girls did
And there were no second person singular conjugations in sight
Wholesome
I mean, this is "common" a dude just put it on reddit and it reached the front page of the sub

So millions of people who voted for him are fascist too
You probably think they are racist as well, does that include the millions of Black and Hispanics who will vote for him in record numbers for a Republican candidate
So you're saying that black Trump supporters are racist
Towards whom
And Hispanics too
Towards whom
They are indoctrinated in their schools, as those are mainly very left wing,so it's definitely not from there
Maybe they are just free thinkers and they like Trump's policies and they don't believe all the lies from the mainstream media
What has Trump said that was racist
I'm still waiting to hear, 4 years later, I'm still waiting
Do you have a clip of him saying racist shit like Biden has
I am smart, that's why I like Trump's policies
Lol so what is the Democratic party then
The kids in college there are all braindead left wingers who support socialism, so someone must be teaching them that
It's the colleges and universities
I've been to the US like 4 times, and I loved it
For me it's by far the best country in the world and I've also been to Germany, which was the worst country I've been to
I wouldn't go back there if you paid me
So Lincoln, George Washington, Jefferson, JFK, Reagan, Roosevelt etc weren't at least good
I mean many were regarding as great Presidents
Trump is a great President too
I haven't found anything racist on his twitter
He is a pretty bad racist when you consider he has done more for the black community since Lincoln
More than Obama, even
Cya, wouldn't wanna be ya .
Is it just me, or is Europe looking kinda of THICC
Portuguese are sad with less space for cod and sardines
The Iberian peninsula is just vibbin
As a portuguese I can confirm
Iberia just vibing through the Ice Age
I remember watching a documentary not too long ago where it claims it was quite lush and green
It was the melting of ice on the Scandinavian peninsula that cause its (Scandinavian peninsula) floor to side and thus Doggerland to lower as a balance of sorts
Much like a continental seesaw
>At least 15
I mean
you're not wrong
The actual origin of the totes hillarious(/s) "remove kebab" meme

Ouch
Ok, Spain
Why dont you love us back Spain :(
Sincerely Portugal
The USSR never died
I thought Portugal would be the most searched by Brits, not gonna lie
No one googles us either :(
Same
We're just searching up the best spots so we can start the revolution
Olivença, we ride at dawn
What even is "Spain"? Wait, don't tell me, I'll find out
That’s portuguese :p
It's the other way around
You can try, my pá de madeira is ready
Aljubarrota style
Right
Thank you
Olivença is already portuguese
We can figth over the  "Jamon ibérico" brand
Madeira for Mallorca
So presenting good arguments is alot harder that making shit up on the spot or just presenting your confirmqtion bias
True, but isn't it also true that the pro-immigration left is using the fact that nazi are indeed involved in this to downplay refugee crime

I too light my fireplace when temperatures reach 10ºC
This is what northern europeans vacationing in southern europe during the winter look like
Here in Portugal we have regions in this time of year that can have 5ºC in the morning and 20-25ºC in the afternoon
Plus, some regions have rain with 20+ ºC. The sweat doesn't go away all day
> god damn 15º degrees during the day
Cute
I freeze with 15c.
From a Portuguese point of view, i won't wear my t shirt until it's a solid 15º-20º in the morning
5º t-shirt is not comfortable, not even if you are Nordic, that's just stereotypes, i'm sorry that's just dumb, take a spring jacket and a t-shirt, and you can just take your jacket off, you guys surely can afford to dress well
I don't like spring jackets, so when it is that time of the year where it's too cold in the morning and too cold in the after noon, i will just wear a hoodie in the morning, it's something you can just carry, it's not that hard to carry your hoodie is it
Oh sweet child of summer
if you knew what winter is
As a Portuguese in the North, when I go to Portugal now, the winter feels like summer
It's bad
Our physical education classes in spring/summer are so hard
Running outside, playing football etc
with 25ºC it's hell
Barbecue
In 10ºC? How can you even hold the tongs with your mittens on
Not to mention the fire hazard that is the scarf
The day
Well I go to work in jeans and tshirt in the summer, anything from 20 to 32 is confortable, more than that and it gets less confortable
Nah, you missed the joke :(
Danmark only has one summer day a year, at least for a Portuguese ;)
*goes into hidding*
You forgot the underage wife
how that mean a hard border between scotland and england
the mind boggles, though of course scotland is welcome
(and england also)
They just need to start using masks more often and take it a bit more seriously
To be fair even the experts had trouble advising people
America is so divided in politics that using a mask becomes political

Leave them be

There will also be no Uyghurs or Tibetans
You mean the ethnicities that were exempt from the one-child policy
I don't mean to defend China's treatment of ethnic minorities but you're completely out of your depth here
That's an absurd exaggeration
>It's kind of ironic as in Europe nobody really cares about their fights on history interpretations
I mean the Greeks and the Macedonians about Alexander the Great
> Chinese market is seriously overrated
What do you mean by this
If they're making money they're not going to stop it's pretty simple
In a few years you will not be able to find a person that was a live in ww2
Some are not even using masks or scrubs
The cleaners at hospitals and just about everywhere, the truck drivers, people at supermarkets, the police and firemen, aircrews transporting things and repatriating people, people at farms and factories producing food and essential stuff, the army evacuating nursing homes and cleaning those up
Fucking right
Let's end this
That's why I never understood the bashing Russia gets
They tried to make bridges between both nations by giving it a common language and state and people act like they did a bad thing

Proud European here
Would be interesting to compare with the previous 30 years to see if there was an improvement (1960-1990)
Same as Portugal
Mapillary/openstreetcam will reach that, some day :D
Only reijavik and the "suburbs" appear to have people, and maybe a small town in the east side

After that i believe is jail time
Money laundering paradises, that's all I see
But it is almost a tugastate
Some of those nations did a military coup though
Those rarely end well
In hindsight, we were very lucky in '74
We could've been taken by the military or the communists as a new dictatorship
If Salazar was still in command, and if that meant a more aggressive approach was needed, do you think it would turn out as it did
Caetano was subtly easing away sanctions (minor ones tbh), and he was still part of the Estado Novo, but he had less overall control
Implying we weren't
Oh yeah, that is true
We were very lucky that the military were very quick to act and that the government stepped down somewhat peacefully
Scotland should take back control

Barbarism never introduced circumcision
Why don't we call it like it is and say its a traditional jewish practice
I had to be circumcised when i was 7, but it was a needed operation
So i dont think it's unnecesary, doing it when there's no need is though, but you should clarify your point
*after careful review, lung cancer can be avoided completely after removal of the lungs at birth
Before there were any here, when only native Europeans existed aka barbarians, there was no circumcisions, then they migrated here throughout the years, and still do, and you'll see an increase in their practice not only from them but also from the weak willed Europeans that were brainwashed in doing so as well
What is so mind boggling about it
It's not a barbaric practice, at all
It's a foreign and hebrew practice
I see, but the problem is that native Europeans (not the majority of course) ARE doing this and have been for a long time . Mostly because they were fooled and misled by jewish doctors and their propaganda
Yes, I know it's not the majority here and I had that in mind, what I'm getting to is that those non native practices should be illegal here in Europe regardless of the people who want to practice it
And going back to my initial statement, I vehemently disagree that foreign practices such as this (and many others) be called "barbaric" because it has literally nothing to do with it
Portugal with money
Completely unrealistic

PORTUGAL CARALHO
For great justice
What do you mean
Indeed
The Portuguese language evolved from the Galician-Portuguese (the so called "Old Portuguese") for the most part
It's not far from the truth when I say Galicia and Portugal are like brothers separated by history
We had that before, didn't work out
Fell to the ground by 1640
At any rate, when it comes to culture and tradition, Galicia is indeed more portuguese than spanish
Madrid owes Lisbon that much
However, the portuguese-spanish border remains pretty much untouched since the Treaty of Alcanises
That's quite a feat, all things considered
Heard it's Europe's oldest border
That we had loads of money at some point
But not since 1910, that's for sure (Maybe just before WWII until the end of the 50's)
Poor guys, trying to spawn in 2017
Spain would recieve many Euromonies to smother it at birth
For the same reason people say Spain and not España.
From when
In Portugal at least half of it isn't there anymore
That's clearly only major lines on the majority of the map btw
Yoy can actually see the GDR border pretty well
Crazy how Athens is still 1400 years older than Rome is
Exactly, there are quite a few European cities over 500 older than Rome

Ladies and gentleman, the President of the Portuguese Republic Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa
Back in December I was randomly waiting for my bus at 22h and he passed with a bunch of people in front of me
Wasn’t expecting to see him so randomly in 300km away from Lisbon .
Here a french journalist interviewing him in the street without realising his role
Then at the end he asks "what is your job, and he answers hahahahaha
My dad just randomly meet him at a beach once proceeded to just casually talk to him like he knew him and tell him how we had the best beaches in Portugal
our president is really swagalicious
i have a selfie with him on the beach
LOOOOOOL eu literalmente tenho esta foto guardada na galeria pra mostrar aos meus netos em 2070lol
His power levels are just TOO HIGH
We have a name for him "Marselfie", because he is named Marcelo and he likes selfies
Not a good president, but popular because he "kisses and hugs" everyone
Popularity does not mean quality
What am i suppost to do with this information
Inter marche> Continente
You are not Portuguese if the President has not given you a beijinho yet
He actually took the decision to self-isolate some time before all this mess became really serious
Maybe he had access to information that the government didn't disclose, or maybe he just wanted to give the example
I believe the second option
There is nothing unusual about a president going to a supermarket shopping
I have seen Jorge Sampaio myself shopping (not a supermarket though) when he was president
Maybe Cavaco and Soares would be unlikely, but Sampaio would do it, and I think Ramalho Eanes also (except when he was president, security was a much bigger issue)
Didn't France use guillotine until 1970 or something

Old habits die hard ne
The leaders of Portugal 500 years ago included queen Leonor, who gave away her wealth to found Santa Casa da Misercórdia and spent her later years in the clothes of a lay sister in a convent
She was, at her request, buried in the middle aisle of the church as a sign of humbleness so people would walk over her grave
Her brother was quite capable of great acts of show off, but was also quite pragmatic at not showing off when necessary
Just the fact that someone without (their) blue blood was ruling would be sufficient for them to go mental
I mean, people don't carry weapons here, and the country is a lot more peaceful compared to the US
Portugal is one of the safest countries in the world, top 3/4
Violent crime is almost zero ( people getting shot/stabbed/etc )
What's the point of assassinating him, we'd just get another president, people with political ambitions aren't on short supply
It'd be like assassinating the Queen of England
That's the point of this post, exactly
I don't know why so much people don't like him
Então o homem agora não pode ir às compras
Not a good president
He has the personality of the people, he is the best person to represent us
I bet you like that other mummy guy
Wasn't he in contact with kids from a school were corona viruses cases apear
I think it was both setting an example and to avoid potentially contamination anyone else if he was infected (which he was not)
Is that the one who killed her husband
> She was, at her request, buried in the middle aisle of the church as a sign of humbleness
I, too, am extremely humble
Well I like marcelos lack of protocol like the one you see here , he’s humble , a nice guy , he is too diplomatic ... like I see himself as a man of no strong convictions especially regarding the garbage the government does and he just lies in bed with them ... doesn’t help Costa and ferro Rodrigues just voicing their support even before Rui rio ( the leader of the party that made marcelos political career ) . So yes Marcelo is a wonderful human being but no perfect president of republic
Because he's the king of popularism, of showing up to give a kiss, calling popular morning tv shows to wish good luck, trying to please greeks and trojans
I like a president that does more than wave and smile
I also like a president that has some backbone, not one guy that today criticizes someone and says that he should be liable for his mistakes, the next day says everything is good and the following day he says there wasn't any issue and the Portuguese people should be thankful of the person he wanted fired 2 days before
You should know this, as this happened just a few days ago
So, no, I don't like this guy
He is the guy that says that blue is better than red and the following minute says red can also be better than blue
Then he says he will take a look at it and then we will give a better informed opinion, only to brush off any future questions about that
This has happened too many times
Perhaps, though it is more likely it was her brother
If it was poison, and could very well be one of the many diseases in a relative backwater
She was the one whose son's body was returned to her in a fishing net, so her arms and of the institutions/city she founded include the fishing net
He made some oopsys, that right
Like the most recent one with Centeno
Not the ideal, yeah, but better than the previous one
At least this one we know he's doing something
By american race theory I think we can pretend to be at least in three different groups lmao
Ok, I remember reading something about her
Just to make sure, her brother is D. Manuel and her husband was D. João II, right
> At least this one we know he's doing something
You are clueless of how bad he has been
You are just saying that because he is popular and he is always everywhere
Tell me what has he done to help the people affected the fires in 2016
What has he done in the scandal of the stolen weapons in the army
What has he done to stop the ever rising number of nepostim in the government
What has he done in other important matters
Nothing, that is it
He promised the people affected by the fires in 2016 they would get help and quick action from the government and 4 years later most still don't have a house and all the money and goods given to those people are still locked in warehouses
The incident with the stolen weapons
Nothing has been done, no one is responsible, no one takes the blame
The nepotism
Why the hell would he do something when his brother has signed 14-FOURTEEN-14 contracts with the government in the last few months
You say something, I say not the right kind of "something" i would like to see from the president
People are too fucking PC here for someone to able to do a joke
Dont worry dude, your joke was lame, but i still think it was funny
Yes
And she was herself heir to the throne on her own right at least twice, when a child because she was her husband's cousin and she was the eldest of her siblings and after her brother ascended to the throne and before he had children

Simple compromise: cut off all the statues' one hand and one leg
It would force people to be inquisitive as to why and learn from it
How about we replace his statue with someone better worth remembering
He won’t be erased from books
Don’t worry
I mean, I get your point
but in that case it's also nice that the people want to pay homage to someone from town even if way less famous
It's the same in pretty much all countries, you have hundred of statues of George Washington, of the Duke of Wellington, of Vasco da Gama, etc
sometimes in places where they have never been, so, yes, praise your local rapper, your painter, that old lady that always said Good Morning to everyone or the postman that always brought treats to the neighborhood's dogs
In my opinion that's the best way to teach kids for the future, showing them that good, knowledgeable and successful people don't need to be from other town, from a far away place and a far away time but rather someone next door
> If a community dislikes the naming of certain things, at the end of the day it's their area and they get to do what they want

*Perkele Intensifies*
This is smart of them
Not least because home companies, even with corruption, sort of keep the money in; and chinese companies simply extract the funds
You get fucked on the balance of payment issue even if you do end up getting cheap and good work
And very often their work is shoddy and follows no certification
Meanwhile in Portugal, our politicians want more and more chinese intervention in our economy
It is a EU wide policy, countries can still choose if they want to follow it or not
China is as much of an enemy as the EU, even less so in many regards
My point is:
Even if the romanian companies are bad, still better than chinese
If they are decent and even good, then they are A LOT BETTER than the chinese option
Market fundamentalists say "its all about the price", but then do not follow their own advice
Because if it is all about the price you count ALL the price - including the money and taxes that stay in the country vs what is sent outside
Well they can impose by denying something else, which is what they do
If you don't follow rules you don't get to use EU funds
The EU, just like the other member states are enemies, just like china
It has its own goals, independent of my countries goals, and thats what makes it an enemy to be fought
It doesn't matter
The EU interference in internal matters is more than enough to make it an enemy
Mistakes and treason happen
Not to mention the EU we joined was a significantly different thing from today
If tomorrow the EU were to return its competences back to what it was in 1986 i'd be happy to reconsider
There is no us here
There is me, and there is you
We have no more in common than i have with the chinese, hell, in many ways we have less in common
How many years of cooperation and trading does romania and portugal have
a handful of decades
What about Portugal and china
450 years
If language, cultural currents and religion are the standard, i'd much rather reunite with Brasil and the portuguese speaking african countries
Clearly you're not a historian either
We didnt have colonies in 1970
They were overseas provinces, and its people were portuguese citizens
As for the "destroyed economy" claim, if 10% yearly GDP growth and 16% public debt is a destroyed economy, then what do you call the absolute disaster that has happened since we joined the EU
The EU has been good at one thing only, Bread and Circus, while destroying our industry, our economy, makes us dependent on it and being a breeding ground for corruption

Bad morning from Portugal
>The phenomenon of politely inviting someone and not  actually meaning it exists in the Netherlands too
I believe this exists pretty much everywhere in Europe at least
Had family members say to me "Devias cá vir um dia destes
", which translates to "You should come over sometime", which is just, in fact, politeness, not an actual invite to be taken  literally
Doesn't mean there's no intent behind it, could mean actual interest to hang out *in the future,* but not an actual invite, nor a commitment to perform an actual invitation
It's more aligned with small talk than anything else

> we understand that discriminating people based on their skin color or their sexual orientation is wrong
"we" don't understand that at all, people are more tolerant nowadays because they had that tolerance hammered into them

Going the alternate history route here, but if Spain left the EU next time Catalonia had a YES leave referendum, shit would hit the fan
The fact that Spain has veto power in the EU council is the main reason a future Catalonia would never be accepted a new EU member which invalidates in practice any independence movement
Now, with Spain out of the EU

You know the best wines are from the driest years
Grapes are a [dry farming] crop
They still need a minimum of water, but just enough for them to grow
More than that and the grapes will have too much water content to make good wine
Theoretically deserts would be very well suited for vineyards as long as you had a controlled water source to provide that required minimum of water, but it's far cheaper to just grow them in places with a wet winter and spring and a long hot and dry summer, like much of the Mediterranean basin
In these places having some rainy days in late summer will usually ruin the chances of having a good wine-making grape harvest
This is really depressing

But sometimes you exagerate with the whole lisping thing and what you say sounds like gibberish
Don't worry, we are just talk bad of you right in front you
No biggie
The languages are very similar
80% of mutual intelligibility
But they struggle to understand us speaking, as we have double their phonemes and they aren't used to listen to a lot of nasal sounds
I've heard Spanish people say Portuguese is much closer to Italian than Spanish
Which is quite untrue seeing as I can understand Spanish without any trouble while Italian is pretty much gibberish with a few sentences in between that I can get
your whole number system fucked me up in school
You know us too well
The African colonies usually open their vowels a fair bit (except the more educated people who actually did study Portuguese in Portugal during colonial times), so it sounds closer to Brazilian than to Euro Portuguese to us, since we notice the differences more than the similarities
I'm sure it's an uncanny valley situation, but I'd say they are somewhere in the middle, even if a bit closer to ours
I feel the same about Brasilians
I remember my friend going "Your dad talks too fast to understand

I can attest this too as an outsider who lived in Finland for a while
Informal spoken Finnish sounded like a very different language, almost like a bunch of grunts, when compared to the other registers
It's because everyone on reddit speaks English so they understand everything you guys say, be it good or bad
On the other hand, virtually no one speaks Swedish outside the Swedes themselves, so most people don't know about these stupid takes from some of the Swedes

All in all, at the end of the day, it is just a mild inconvenience that pushes me to learn German faster, which is a language that I absolutely love
I don't think there is any ill will from the Germans, I just think that, like the French and Spaniards, Germans are naturally bad at learning languages, generally speaking of course
As a foreigner living in Germany for the third time, from what I've seen, very few people can speak English here
Pretty much everything that comes from an Anglophone country to Portugal is subbed, let it be a movie/TV show/Video Games/etc

8% of the calls made to 112 (911 for Portugal basically) are not emergencies". The banter is real
The best thing that came out of the european union so far
You can fly to any Schengen member state with your national ID card alone
This is not bound to road or ship, but any transportation means
The UK allowed you to do so with the national IDs alone, but they were not required to
Being a Schengen-area member, you're required to allow entry/exit of any member country with your ID card alone, if any check is put in place
The UK was never a Schengen member
I remember seeing that while visiting Dublin, though I had no idea what it was supposed to be about
Honestly I just thought the statues looked cool
That's approximately 2
4% of the population
Very impressive
For perspective, in the US that would be 7
5 million people, while the largest protest in recent times, the 2017 Women's March, had less than 5 million protesters (which is still impressive in my view)

Seeing Europe, America and Asia Pacific this invested in renewable energy gives me a little bit of hope
And fucking Timor-Leste in the ass with their natural gas
Haha, Spain is burning - Wrote the Portuguese as he died of a heatstroke
It's bad in here too dear neighbor
Once I was from from 15:00 to 19:00 without leaving the river cause of heat
That's what they call a normal summer Tuesday there
Anyway that's the worst of Madrid, crazy weather and no beach nearby to cool down
According to the map, Portugal and France already burned now
Portugal has already burn out
We're burning too, bros
Help
Now try working from home with no AC in this weather
Hermanos, we are together
Except not so much because those temperatures are hell
Please, consider visiting the portuguese atlantic coast
Sincerely, a portuguese who almost melted with our recent heatwave
Southern Europe is like *"ok,  apparently summer is 6 months long now"*
It's not that bad this week though, let's just wait for that heat wave to reach us
Well as of late, Lisbon  hasn't been any better with 40+ temperatures recently too
Sevilla is the hottest place I’ve been to in europe
It was soooooo hot
Yup
Sem ar condicionado n da isto
*e mesmo assim
I can feel the waves of heat as soon as I climb upstairs in my house
This summer started my habit of redditying in bed because I just lay in bed without sheets melting in my own sweat
siesta, and dinner at 23 hours
And now construction workers have to use it all day, think about it
Here in Figueira it’s fine as long as you’re not doing anything more intense than a brisk walk
This past week seems to be fine, nothing compared to them lol
I've been sleeping naked without sheets with windows open and I feel hot
Only works for coastal towns
A few km's inland and the difference is obvious
They have to, but they don't.
Yep, fortunately the heat wave came and went
Together we are stronger
Let's put our differences aside and work together for a better future
for 70 years now France hasn't had to surrender to Germany
British people be like, don't care about none of that
I like my beaches dirty and my lead petrol with lead
Almost everything is stuff that the right wing loonies want to get rid off
This is also what they mean with deregulation
Remember, there is also talks in the UK of also revoke the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and they talk of this as the obvious thing to do
Europe has gives us all stability, peace and economic development
I don't understand why there are people against the eu
Yes, shit title, OP
It's misleading
nice cameo, this could be part of the US space force
But thats a German tank with a Pole on top
But why does it have an mg42
This is the new normal now
As an irreligious person, to those saying Fuck all religion:
Why do you think religion exists
It is a natural human reflex, to cope with the unknown of the world, the unknown of death, sorrow, grief, to have a meaning for many
None of those things are bad in any way
Religion is a set of ideas
Saying fuck all religion is like disliking free market capitalism and then saying "all economic models are bad" because of it
It's time for Europe to stop being afraid of pointing the finger to this source of terror, that will not stop, as it is not compatible with western values
Islam
And of course he already has people calling him a racist because he thinks radical islamism and killing innocents in the name of a god is bad
I mean, less than a 100 years ago **one** country did what it did against Jews without being provoked
Do they real think it's wise to get an entire continent riled up
If Europe  snaps it's not going to be pretty
Don't poke the bear

WTF is the Tetris challenge
> Anyone who criticizes those who don’t believe in climate change but are against nuclear power are just as unreasonable
I don't trust people in my country to be able to build and run a lemonade stand, let alone a nuclear plant
Plus, nuclear plants are expensive and take a long time to build
My country is also small, poor and has a lot of green energy investment, making nuclear energy even less important
And since a certain zone in my country has suffered a massive cancer rate rise due to your country's radioactive waste, forgive me if I take those allegations of "energy nuclear is safe" with a grain of salt when even the richest country in the planet can't be bothered to clean its own trash
Or when countries think that it's ok to build nuclear plants on one of the most seismic active zones on the planet
Bill Gates is on Reddit
Well I guess that makes sense for an AMA but he's a strong believer in Nuclear too

Ah, the wholesome eighties, where the whole family sat down for Xmas dinner and saw LIVE on TV the execution of Ceausescu and his wife
religion is such a stupid concept
Good for Europe
Bad for me my country is still in the dark ages
This is indeed great news to the indo European people
Now we just need to get rid of non native religious influences
Not weird at all, Europe is full of nations states, each with it's homogenized population, some of the bigger countries are getting diluted by mass immigration but the small ones are keeping it real, tradition is something that isn't lost in a flash, it's a gradual process of dilution, my grand parents didn't care about the church, they raised my parents as non religious people, and me and all my cousins don't believe in god either nor do we practice religion, yet, we attended church as kids and went trough the process because here in Portugal the church is like a "school" you go to on Sunday, even if my parents didn't go as adults they still enrolled us because it's tradition  and we decided ourselves not to care about it when we came of age, weird, but still they didn't force us to either go or not go, it's just the societal default, people are just getting smarter and noticing the Church is just a business like any other, they sell you social acceptance, the feeling of belonging to something greater, you know
Same thing in Portugal
Even that high number of Christians is most likely people who claim to be Catholic but don't attend church aside from the occasional wedding or baptism (we still have a high % of Catholics though)
Religion as a all is the world's biggest enemy rn
I fail to see how the ethnic makeup of the different states (and even though it doesn't like so, there's plenty of non nation-states in Europe) has anything to do how religion is supposedly part of "real tradition".
Hey yo
You must love to drink that fucking american juice
Same in Quebec
The Church was at the centre of French Canadian/Quebecois identity
And then in about 10 years, with the Revolution Tranquille, the Church took a backseat
It depends on how and what's the intent
For example if it's using Islam as a way to be racist I'm not a fan, if it's denouncing the ingrated misogyny I react differently (unless it's doing it disingenuously as if all of Europe wasn't so)
Everyone knows that the Lord of Light is the one true god

I was about to say the same thing, considering the size of the country it's not that much considering the news we've been getting
I feel like in Portugal we've had half has bad and we're much smaller
Weren't even a hundreth
50000 to 500000 km2
Thats a tenth my dude
Thats half the country vs half percent of a country
With a population density much smaller
Not saying the Australia fires aren't impressive and worthy of our attention but I'll keep my "feeling" in this matter, a lot more people I knew were affected directly by fires than the average Australian will know

Exactly this
A right wing party established last year in Portugal is already the third biggest
Jesus definetely existed
He was a historic character
The thing is wether he did all those miracles, but this enters the field of faith
EDIT:
Foda-se, who did this map
Porra
Porra
We say porra in Portugal when we are in front of sensitive people
Foda-se
and Caralho
are the real ones
EDIT: in some years, how will I explain to my grandkids that my most upvoted comment on reddit is this one
This is wrong
In portugal it's FODA-SE and not porra
False
CARALHO or FODA-SE is the real most important word in Portugal
Porra
Fds, caralho, mas que merda é esta
This map is clearly wrong, considering all the upvoted comments in this post
I'd say OP simply went to Google translate or some online dictionary and translated fuck to all the other languages, just to get some karma
I downvoted because this map blows
The word "porra" exists in Portugal and is used to cuss
BUT, in this context, where it is obviously being defined as THE cuss word, then it's clear that the OP committed the SACRILEGE of choosing THE cuss word of the Brazilians and not the Portuguese, otherwise this would have been either "caralho" or "foda-se".
OP is now banned from r/PORTUGALCARALHO
just in case: /s
As a portuguese, we say Foda-se
"Porra"? Mas tamos a brincar
Foda-se
Actually, porra is not a swear word
It should be "foda-se" or "caralho" in portugal
Russia isn’t there because Russian is itself all bad words
Porra and Joder are not the same thing, not even close
r/notcoolguides
Porra
Foda-se
Portugal should be "Foda-se"
Porra
More like a good ol' FODA-SE CARALHO QUE É ESTA MERDA
Foda-se quésta merda
Portugal also accepts Puta, Fodasse, Caralho and a multitude of other funny sounding slurs
in Portugal it´s "Caralho
" and not "Porra
r/PORTUGALCARALHO
r/Portugal
Porra
Ai foda-se, puta que pariu caralho, quem é que diz essa merda
We say FODA-SE or merda, but definitively not porra, thats old fashioned and fun fact also means jizz in portuguese from brazil
Hey, Portugal here
Not porra, Foda-se
In Portugal no one says porra
We say Foda-se and Foda-se was my reaction when I saw this map
In Portugal, "Foda-se" is the most frequent swear word, "Porra" is used predominantly by Brazilians
Porra
A única pessoa que diz isso devia ser eu no 5o ano
About the portuguese one, doubt X
At this time I can’t even count the times people assume that Portugal is somehow Brasil
As a Portuguese this starts to annoy me a lot . Not that I don’t like Brasil, but in my opinion this is very disrespectful towards Portuguese language and Portuguese people
Although we share most of our vocabulary, don’t forget that there’s still a lot of differences between the two
Portuguese is way off
The word for the expletive "fuck" would be "fodasse".
Porra is the family friendly version here
We say Foda-se
It translates to "Fuck it"
Portugal one is not even close
It would either be "fodasse", which is fuck, or "caralho" which is cock and/or something similar to "fuck" and basically a word we use to reinforce  every thing we say
"Porra" is used a lot more by brazilian portuguese speakers
Also on a very interesting side note, "caralho" used to be a nautical term that defined the lookout post at the top of the main mast in ships
Since it was a very unstable spot, and just a shitty place to be, it would be assigned to people that did something wrong, as punishment
A normal curse used in portuguese derives from that:
"vai para o caralho" literally meaning "go to caralho", that shitty spot
Normal translation would be close to "go fuck yourself".
Foda-se
Really ?
The same for Portuguese “porra”. The equivalent to fuck would be foda-se
Um cona mole qualquer
Alguém que acha que em Portugal se fala brasileiro
Filho dum grande cabrao
Um most cases we say both "foda-se, caralho
" In this particular order
I came here to say this, FODASSE
What is this
Brazil
AQUI DIZ-SE FODA-SE E CARALHO
FODA-SE, QUE CARALHO
Another favorite would be CARALHO
One small thing just for fun: you can start pretty much any sentence with Foda-se and end it with Caralho, including the mythical "Foda-se caralho
" and still make sense
I like de flexibility of Caralho to be "arálho
Foda-se is like fuck or fuck it, but the verb foder or means to have intercourse, if someone says "vai-te foder" it means go fuck yourself
Caralho can be fuck, but it can also mean cock, but it is usually used just as an exclamation to emphasize something you're saying, for example: "isto é bom como o caralho" wich translates to this is good like caralho
Porra is a soft badword to use as an exclamation, it can also mean jizz, but it is more used for jizz in Brazillian Portuguese
Fun fact, foda-se can be abbreviated to fds
Porra - mainly used in brazil, means cum
Foda-se
-  Fuck
Caralho
- translating, means dick
, but can mean anything, depending on the situation
very true
That's the way
I did the same to my polish friends
Not really, not in Portugal
In Brasil, sure
it does, but brazillians use it more with that context than we do in portugal
We just use it as a soft release of anger or exclamation
it's still not the most common
the most used ones are the ones I said
Porra isn't really considered a swearword in Portugal
That space before ! always make me think the person saying it is almost expectantly waiting to see my reaction
No idea why
Sempre em capslock
This
'Porra' is more of a Brazil thing
We can say it as well, but the better words are 'Caralho' and 'Foda-se' (last one similar to Spanish 'joder')
> Belgium was a mistake
It sure as hell was
Wrong: it's used a lot in Alentejo
> Porra - mainly used in brazil, means cum
What
I don't know a single person that doesn't say porra
Porra caralho que te parta
Put it this way, 'Porra' is for when your mom wants to cuss but the kids are in the room
PORTUGAL CARALHO
Caps lock or no caps lock
FODASSE
r/SuddenlyGay
We sure have a way with words don't we
Haha, we are told the exact same story here about caralho
then the equivalent for "fottiti" would be "vai-te foder" or "fode-te"
today I learned
talvez expliquei mal, cá em portugal é raro utilizar porra para dizer esperma
apenas como interjeição, já é normal
Ah, sim
Heated Italian moment
In Portugal we also have a few fun names such as:
- Picha (Cock)
- Venda da Gaita (The Bagpipe's (Cock in slang) Sale, possibly
- Lugar do Além (Something as the Afterlife's place)
- A couple of towns including the word "Rata", initially a word for female rat, but most commonly used for female genitalia
As far as I know at least in some places in Eastern Europe the derogatory term is "Chorni" (black) and not "Nyegr" (Negro)
As is in other languages
It's normal that the person who wrote "Serbian nigger" is not trying to present a negative way
I used to work in Ukrainian kids summer camps and when they talked about black people they always said "niggers". And this was not meant to be insulting at all
For the sake of *American* political correctness
Why do you dislike it
“Just 1€”
What
They had done the same thing in brussels when I went there
Don't know if it is still up though
AFAIK, they do it in the Lisbon airport
Last time I flew back home from Lisbon, there were several vending machines with 1€ water bottles
There was a vending machine in Porto's airport that was 1€ as well, near the old security
I don't know where it is now, tho
We are normalish around here
Had a normalish summer all summer
Rain is supposed to arrive late this week, which would be fantastic and very welcome (unless it is a problem for any harvest, but I think the wine harvest is mostly done)
Hey Iceland, you have a place for me for a while
This picture is so hot
30 degrees on Alentejo and Andaluzia, time to wear our coats
Yeah, I feel this year hasn't been too bad for us
Probably could have used more rain here and there, but at this point, we can *always* use more rain
But temperature-wise, pretty standard
For them yeah
They got like 35 in Paris today, or 30 in London, for them it is a lot
Well more than we had
Here it has been some days consistently of 18-26 give or take a few degrees which is quite perfect weather for this time of the year
THEY had a hot summer with lots of heatwaves
Us (and the irish and the icelanders) had normalish summers for our individuals definitions of normal
The Atlantic is the best thing
Really
We are in fucking September
Of course 30+ for a couple of days might be considered a heatwave
People talk about this things because they don't understand shit
For gods sake we are getting some rain now, and let's hope the winter is not dry otherwise we are fucked for 2021 summer
People in Portugal have a really bad misconception about summer
Guys clear your fucking minds, our summers are not like the summers in some other places
Our coast is facing the atlantic
Most of the west coast, mainly the west coast from Lisbon up north shouldn't be surprised of fogs in the morning and the "nortadas" (north winds), many days a month on the summer months
People shouldn't be surprised of some rain in the summer, but every time it rains especially in the north people react like it's a fucking big surprise even though it is normal to rain in the summer some days even if it's only a small quantity
Sorry for the fucking rant
In Portugal
It is below 20 everyday, the minimum
Are you a foreigner who thinks max temperatures above 20 are high
Dude come on
It is quite fresh right now
Please don't
Please, this summer was normal for us
We didn't even hit 40° this year
Why does Cali have hotter summers than us tho
Is it the desert you have
Portugal is not an indivisible entity, it has multiple climates
This summer has been normal here (in the Alentejo)
Last summer was actually cool, there was only a single day where it reached 40 degrees (in contrast, this summer, over here we had 2 weeks of 40+ days)
Yes I know it has multiple climates
This summer wasnt't normal even in Alentejo
Just go and see the Boletim Climatológico of IPMA
I trust the data not the perception of summer of people
Hmm
Interesting
Our winds always come from the north
Our heatwaves always come from Africa tho (like this pic)
They're very unusual
I guess that explains why LA is hotter
And the Santa Ana winds explain why LA IS hotter in August whilst July is Europes' warmest month
Sure thing buddy
From the sea yes
Our coasts are cooler because of that
Wind rarely comes from the south so all we have is strong winds from the sea, colder winds of course
Stanford University, interesting
Resembles a lot with alentejo and algarve
Definitely reminds me a lot of my Algarve
What is the location
I've been to Andalucía several times, but mostly the big places: Ayamonte, Huelva, Cadíz, Sevilla, beach places, etc
and none of the smaller places
Very beautiful town, those who went there suggest visiting it
Let's go Russia
As we say in Portugal: The people are who rule the most
Can I get on that list too
I'd reckon that every single country in existence is going to end up on at list at some point
Why is this even on r/Europe

Portugal, the real neutrals,
That's us alright
It's the only true Portuguese way ;)
Foi tipo um que abriu um post no /r/Portugal se éramos um povo Gay friendly, comentario de topo foi mesmo tipo meh we dont care
The Portuguese way is saying we don´t care but deep down we actually do, we are just "too nice" to be straightforward about it
going off of my parents (and other Tugas over here) its just that they rather we marry to Portuguese instead
We're like : We've lived with all of those for so long that we just joke about them all the time
But at the end of the day we're pretty much ok with any of them unless they steal our bacalhau
Other option could be : Heh
as long as he/she is hot or good in bed
We only care about football, sun and party
The Portuguese way is saying we don´t care but deep down we actually do, we are just "too nice" to be straightforward about any important matter
Like
whatever
Do what suits you, just don't bother me
Thats us alright
"Desde que não se aproxime do meu cu não me importo" - Every Portuguese when asked about that

As a portuguese this makes me cringe
Portugal please
We were kings of the world
Best season by far
And now António Guterres  Secretary-General of the United Nations
except we still have many songs and shows "not available in your country"
Hum
they should look at the mobile plans in Portugal
For instance on Vodafone they have a plan with 500Mb for 2,25€ a week where the traffic generated by Pokémon GO, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook Messenger, Whatsapp, Skype, iMessage, FaceTime, Viber, Spotify, Vodafone Call + and Message + is included and doesn't count for those 500Mb
If you use Telegram for messaging it counts, if you use any other social network that's not Facebook it counts and this happens on every provider
Haha, good luck getting the rest of the public to side with you on this, all they think say is "so what, you're getting stuff for free, why are you complaining
" when that is a terrible mindset
I'd rather they give me another GB than those free apps
What if instead of using the Facebook app I want to use a wrapper
What if I use Pandora instead of Spotify or signal instead of WhatsApp
These are common real world scenarios and these isps are essentially giving these apps a monopoly
Just a few days ago I said to my friends that maybe we should ditch WhatsApp and move to telegram, none of them wanted to switch because they have free WhatsApp
That's a clear violation of net neutrality and possibly monopoly laws
But the FCC is getting rid of net neutrality completely, including home ISP's.
congrats on the president
This is so so much better than all those hundreds of photos "it snowed here

There is this stew with peas and poached eggs which takes easy ingredients and is kind of wholesome comfort food
It is even seasonal though noawadays it is year round thanks to frozen peas
Ervilhas com ovos à portuguesa
If you can google translate this recipe
the sausage might be complicated, it is not the same as any italian sausage, but I think it would be good with just bacon or similar
I do not include any herbs or garlic, they can kind of kill the flavour of the peas - but a bit of tomato passata if not ripe tomatos is important
this recipe in english is actually quite good  (though if you do not have chouriço, bacon or similar would do)
If you have dried cod and patience (and eggs), then a lot can be done
Eggs are really seasonal right now
I strongly recommend you make a francesinha, it's one of my favourites dishes
And good luck to everyone
You’re doing god’s work
Now chickens are kept in big factories and it is all really controlled so we have constant supply throughout the year, of eggs and lots of other things
But usually, traditionally chicken laid less eggs (or some chickens stopped laying) during winter (mention here for example  and with the arrival of spring, they started laying more eggs
hence egg being a symbol of Easter and spring, and lots of egg recipes for this time of the year
I remember when I was a kid when grandmamas distrusted shop, battery, eggs, there was hoarding of eggs in December for all the christmas cakes since there were few eggs
Even now, if you are into (ilegal, but nevermind that
I cook those well
) eggs, those are scarcer in winter
It is similar, but it works very well also with just bacon
It is traditional to this time of the year, when the peas are out, and it is very cozy
It is one of the backup meals of every portuguese home cook
edit - just to make it clear because I found abominations when googling recipes in english, the eggs are cooked right on top of the peas
the egg white sets around the peas, which is fine, and you cook the eggs to your taste
(I am still shocked over americans poaching the eggs in water and then assembling it)
Also slow cooking the onion and bacon/chouriço is important
He was probably talking about homegrown chicken eggs in the old days, atleast as a fellow Portuguese I've never heard about eggs being seasonal or lack of eggs in any time of the year
> atleast as a fellow Portuguese I've never heard about eggs being seasonal or lack of eggs in any time of the year
ask the oldest ladies (or better not) you can find
Things can be naturally seasonal
We are out of touch of it a bit right now, and even back then there were eggs even in darkest winter, it was just they were more plentiful (and better) when spring arrived

I went from Helsinki to Tallinn, Riga adn then Vilnius in ~1 week just before the whole COVID shit went down
Did the whole thing by train/bus and it was surprisingly cheap
These capitals are relatively small so you can see them in a couple of days
I wouldn't bother with helsinki again though, not much to see and everything is really expensive + I did the boat ride to Tallinn at night so I couldn't even see anything
> Was it weird for you
The only thing weird was having two legal currencies during the transition period, other than that it really didn't make any difference on my day to day
It only really made an impact on travelling in Europe or with dealing with people or companies from other Eurozone countries

There are lesser cold days and more warmer days in the future I would say
It looks normal, maybe  sedate (good
) around here
No issues
34 max, 17/18 low, great summer weather
I am hardly ever turning on the AC
At least for the Iberian Peninsula it has always been like this
It's not possible to have a summer without at least a few 40ºC+ days
And Portugal you know the Litte country on the left SIDE of spain
wow, 24, 24 C. All of that, thoughts and prayers
24 C. Wow
Portugal is just happy whit Galiza on top of it
I just like how spain is fed up with Portugal
San Marino placed a little lower would look like a monocle of Italy
Most eastern countries havin a good time
Ukraine: *A A A A A A A H*
You should add more islands, Azores, Canaries and Madeira
Why is Spain so depressed tho lmao
Oh the eyepatches on countries with flags with patches
Nice
I wish Portugal could get one as well, in the tradition of Camões
I would add the Madeira, Azores and Canary Islands
Otherwise it's pretty dope
Galiza and Portugal are basically best buddies :)
It's about time you ditch Spain and join us
It's only right
Haha
There are "forces" that want that
OP probably only drew regions with significant separatist movements
And Portugal is laughing at that, I just love the detail in this art
Do it Galiza, that would be cool
Great idea
But sad to say that in Portugal this would never work
Looks like Europe got a herpes outbreak
I would buy a print of this

It seems no one voted for the ones making this decisions
What the hell did i miss
Can I move to Finland
It's too cold here in Portugal
But
but that's cold :\ can't wait for the 45ºc :D (it was the max temp last summer)
Meanwhile in Lisbon the maximum for today is 19ºC... It's officially hotter in Finland than in Portugal
Toughen up
Portugal: Hah
hah
HAHAHAHAHAHA
melting ~~I'm fine
~~with fire
>temperature is about 27 degrees
Now that’s a sauna
if i went to a sauna and temperature was similar to 27 degrees in a train I would want a refund immediately or I would call the police
dudes, you are looking like southerners complaining of cold when it'
s +10
>When the sun shines multiple days in a row without a cloud in sight the temperature indoors can get much higher
open the windows at night, or dusk
It will cool it all down
and for fuck´s sake, shut the shutters during daylight particularly in the hot parts of the day
I once had to explain to scandinavians they really had to shut the shutters in the morning but they fucking pouted about the concept that the house would be dark during daytime, while they were not even there
not sure they did what I told them to do
and that would be a fair comparison to say a Finn complaining (fairly) of 35+, or 40+ or 45+ plus heat anywhere elsein august
But this meme of finland burning down at something like 22, or the other day, 10,  I wish this meme gets a well deserved rest
or it might suffer heat stroke, from those temperatures in the low 20s...
it fucking sucks i want my 30ºs
Yep, who do you think carries the torch for tech innovation in the EU now that the UK is gone
The German
lol
Apple Music also offers premium in the EU, so I don't follow your logic, tbh
But that's because of their business model, not because they aren't European
As a Portuguese, I’m surprised Portugal’s figures are so good to be honest
We might be poor, but atleast we are responsible
Paying bills > eating
I'm surprised we are doing so well here in Portugal
It could be a consequence of direct debit being so widespread
So perhaps this reflects more how good the companies are at collecting payments than how finantially stable households are
PORTUGAL CARALHO
Maior parte das pessoas que vivem em bairros sociais não conseguem pagar impostos e são bastantes pessoas que não conseguem, portanto ao ver isto fiquei mesmo surpreendido

Nokia was the brand we trusted, but they just wouldn't go android I don't know why

They did make a lot of money selling out to Microsoft, so I guess they were fine
But they completely lost the smartphone train

I used to work in a supermarket in Portugal and I would get sick by the amount of food that was thrown away
Workers couldn't take it home and had to pour bleach on said food so that people wouldn't do what this guy did
We had the same happen recently here in Portugal, but it was like an entire kitchen full of food
Fucking disgraceful waste
Ptasie mleczko are just the best sweets ever created
Pingo Doce
They used to but someone got sick on some expired food and they stopped doing it
They did the bleach thing in the first store I was in
In the second the dumpster was kept inside the store at night and taken away in the morning
Still, there were lots of times when someone had to open packages of expired food like pasta and rice and throw them away because bleach wouldn't sufice in that case
And this had to be done by people who in many cases could barely afford food with the shitty wages they were paying
Unreal experience
I'm assuming if people were able to get good food from dumpsters they'd get criticised so they purposely ruin it so that doesn't happen
Leaving that place was one of the happiest days of my life
Do they do anything with the recovered bikes

I'm afraid that you're incorrect
Opinio juris is not made up of  the opinion of jurists - in international law, the opinion of jurists is to be found in the decisions of the ICJ and similar adjudicative bodies - a different strand of IL entirely
Opinio juris is the embodiment of state practice, founded in the states' belief of a legal obligation leading to that activity
Opinio juris is also seen in the decisions of international organizations, especially UN resolutions
There is no doubt at all that this resolution can embody opinio juris
I agree with your description of jus cogens
I did not say that this decision alone would (or could) ever constitute jus cogens on its own
It is, however, possible that it would contribute to the creation of a new rule of jus cogens at some point in the future

Come on, you wankers dont even know how to roast cod
You want to catch a cod to eat it RAW
WHAT A DISGRACE
I CANT EVEN
I dont care how you kill it, I care how you eat it
ahah, thank you for that , you are forgiven, I love the Inbetweeners
'I am not gonna eat that, it comes from the FUCKEN sea'
Basically our 1000 cod dishes
Here is one of the [most famous] Its eaten mostly as a beer snack or appetizer
Another [one] It is made mainly with shredded thin slices of potato, we call it "hay potato", olives, cod, eggs
Third cod one
Its called [cod with cream] and its basically what it says
Cod, mashed potatoes and cream all mixed together and sent to the oven
My mom makes the best one, in Xmas its what we always eat
If you dont want cod, definitely recommend Francesinha, which is like a meat overload
You can find them especially in Porto
Its a big sandwich, with a juicy spicy sauce
Woah there buckaroo, in portugal we eat a lot of potatoes
They are in pretty much every traditional dish
I think a better comparison would be between potatoes, pasta, and rice
As a Portuguese person: since when do we prefer tomatoes
Lol we love potatoes tho
I don't think it's the case for Portugal
In my case, my grandparents always had tons of potatoes, tomatoes, corn and olives, in the interior
In the big city, I grew up eating a lot of potatoes, but tomato salad was always on the table
Is there are data corroborating this observation
As a Portuguese who is a potato fan, this is all sorts of wrong for me
These are both non european products that were imported from America by the Portuguese
Does it makes no sense to speak of such a geographic divide
You're lucky you're not neighbours with Buñol

The old version of the Portuguese anthem had "contra os bretões marchar" (= Against the Britons, [we'll] March)

Those niches with statues outside the towers are shocking, the statues are vulnerable and they are a weak point in the structure, when sieged it would obviously be the first target

If it is not really defensive, it is not a castle
That is not a real castle, it is a 19th palace with romanticized castle elements
I know in german they call everything schloss, but that is not so in my native language
Castles are castles, real defensive things
Then you can have palaces, manors, stuff like that, and a clue if it is 19th century and not really defensive (there are some defensive 19th century structures though not for rich people to live in) it is as much a real castle as Disneyland
You could literally put any European country on that title and that picture would fit and be true

We portuguese made a point of calling the sign the same name we use for the animal (caranguejo) to avoid thinking about it
Brazilians, however, despite having the same name for crabs that we do, use "câncer" for the sign as well

So its plain pasta for the first 10 minutes of the meal and an overload of sauce with the last 3 spaghetti
And to think that I once ate Swedish meatballs and enjoyed them
How naïve I was
Pizza is different, you eat it in slices, getting a sample from every ingredient, top to bottom
But I even wonder how a person who does that to pasta would eat pizza
I put the tomato sauce on top of the pizza dough
Do you put it on the bottom
I have been defeated
wtf no Portugal
Liberals around here can't stop whining about us being a socialist dictatorship can't we get some recognition guys
Again with the americanizations
Why should we care what they think or what they do

Its an armillary sphere
I'm quite aware of that but it looks like a radioactive picto in that context
Oh yeah hahaha sorry
That looks like our Berlin balls (a sweet that we normally buy at the beach)
I wounder if they taste similar
In Portugal we have cakes like this, but we call them Berlin balls, and the have inside them a cream of egg and sugar
Here we also have variants of the normal Berlin ball with locust bean (alfarroba), and some with chocolate

I still don't understand the logic behind the choice to divide Ribatejo in two
Maybe they did it for statistical reasons or because the Lezíria do Tejo is a region with a lot of farms and primary sector businesses like Alentejo has
But it's so weird to see concelhos like Rio Maior in the same region as Beja
It would be like puting Covilhã in the Norte region

I'm sure that one way to grab people's attention is by telling them that the EU wants to kill 'memes'.

that would see internet giants such as Google and Facebook *AND EVERY OTHER WEBSITE* forced to pay for linking to press articles
The principle of it is also stupid as fuck, why would you need to pay for linking
That's like charging someone for giving out the address of a business
Plus, it's not even optional:
> "Voss's latest amendments would make the link tax an inalienable right, that news publishers cannot waive even if they choose to," the Electronic Frontier Foundation points out
Also we've just managed to keep net neutrality a thing, why would we just throw it away
>That would mean they would have to **pay** instead of steal content
The end is near
Linking is stealing
I guess I shouldn't tell anyone where the nearest grocery store is and what sort of things they sell, otherwise I'm stealing from them
Wake the fuck up mate
>And for fucks sake, it's not about linking
What is it about then

txt and all of the big sites will take them off their search results immediately

>To be fair, it does seem to be rather cold in Portugal for this time of the year
It is perfect, I love it and it is not unusual
We are one of the countries with less impact of temperature increase, botg current and forecasted
We are by the north Atlantic, which really moulds our  climate
Tbh it feels like Summer always arrives later in Portugal when compared to Europe but then it extends until October
> I wish winter would be an all year event
I wish the same
Low 30s in late September as a high is unusually high, too high IMO for Porto right on the coast
From the wikipedia
the average high for Porto in June is 23
5 C and September is a little bit warmer in all aspects, with an average high at 24
1 . So your weather was less average than today according to historical records
And the weather is fine and not remarkably cold in my experience
Ooh, I've climbed it many times
So adorable
What breed is this
Highly doubting the Spanish score
Been working with Spanish people for three years, they rarely speak English
When you speak English they laugh, when I speak Portuguese they say no te entiendo
I have to speak Spanish and don't even know how
Wouldn't the results not be exactly right since one's definition of "being able to read and write one foreign language" can be different from others'?
What about a foreign language that is not English
Portugal:
English since primary school up until high school ;
In 7th grade you can choose another foreign language, the most common being French, but some schools offer Spanish, Italian or German
BAAAAAAKA MONO GA
GERMAN SCIENCE IS THE BEST IN THE WORLD
That's a good point, but that won't happen
You'll deregulate the entire industry and allow huge corporations to mass fish
You’re making assumptions too lol
Amazing how we were in worse condition than the russians, who were coming out of serfdom
In fact we were by far the most illiterate country in Europe
One of the reasons why Portugal was so far behind the rest of the Europe was because almost all portuguese had portuguese as their mother tongue, while other southern European countries like France, Spain and Italy had several regional languages, which in a time of nationalisms and Nation States was seen as inappropriate, and led to an investment in public education
I think we probably still are
Being in the high 98% still might not be enough to not be the last on this race nowadays
ah ha
Privilegia goes brrrr
Yep, I think so too
I know plenty of old people (70+) in the village I grew up in that can't read or write
Safe construction right here people, also really safe road ...
I dont even understand why Im being downvoted, building houses on top of a cliff besides the sea is incredible stupid and dangerous
Our government (Portugal) said there was help available from us
Don't know how it turned out though
We haven't been under much heat and we're used to forest fires so I guess it would be a good help
The EU model it's actually the worst model
You end up giving consent in those small letters from enormous tos
It would be preferable to adopt a registry model
I get robocalls nearly daily from "the Canadian DOJ" claiming that I have a warrant for my arrest on my "account".
It's not even accidentally
If you don't consent the tos you are out of that service
You end up receiving calls anyway
The best model is to have a opt out list
We had that in my country and ended because of the EU law
Welcome to hell rest of Europe
You will now all be acused of being lazy and make siestas of 10h per day
Portugal at the top 2 and we are join by Greece, the 2 most western and Eastern parts of Europe, nice
Amareleja gonna be Amareleja
It's hot as hell there
And once again the Greeks beat us
Se aqui está calor, imagina na Amareleja
Feels like shit, doesn't it
Same, and I live in Portugal
fml
We are now colder than Germany
Guess we are the best now
You get used to the averae temperature
I'm from Portugal and i've delt with 40+ temperature
I hate hot weather but i could still take 30 degrees
Now i've been living in the UK for a few years and i'm currently being coocked with the same 30º i used to tolerate in Portugal
those confortable 1980's stadium seats
if it's anything like my country, someone made a lot of money with some extra seats they had laying around
And now can make more in turning them around
The guy that commissioned the job gets some also of course
Ypres/Ieper, I recommend for one day visit, a small but nice city
The canal, a lot of good parks, memorials, the big arch, the cathedral connected with the Hall in the photo, Bicky Burgers, Cherry Beers
There is also a cats carnival party
Surprise culture attack
One more reason for Galiza to join Portugal
It prolongs the vowel
They voted for it what do they want now
Thats what happens when you make a choice: consequences
What a bunch of crying irresponsible babies
That is not the only irony, now imagine that an un-elected head of state asked another un-elected monarch to suspend democracy
ain't that irony !
Best part of Europe is an InterRail
I did an Eurotrip this summer by car
I think its a lot better than doing it by train if you are not worried about money ( parking prices are ridiculous in some places ) and if you are not mentally hadicaped and are able to read google maps
Why you cut Portugal of the photo :(?
Prague always looks nice
Ireland wants to know your location
Now imagine a israeli christmas tree
Fuck, I was about to comment this
UK will have 2019 next year
I think Portugal's value is too high i would say it is like around 650-750
The actual median wage if you ignore the 1% is so much lower than that
Like 800 at most
Compare that with the price of energy (electricity, gas, gasoline, LPG, etc)
For intance, we in Portugal have higher price on everyone of the 4 sources of energy mentioned than Spain
Why Portugal
why
(I'm portuguese so I can talk trash of the country)
Hurray Portugal
Cries in portuguese
Would love to see how different this would look without the top and bottom 1%.
Portugal is wrong
More then 50% of labor operators recieve 550€ the minimun wage
*cries in Eastern-European*
BUT
why
That will probably be the median salary, but not the average one
We get paid in 14 months and this is probably calculated with 12 months
I managed to find some data in [Eurostat] which might provide this info (you need to swap the unit of measurement to PPS, rather than Euro which is the default selection when opening that page)
Here's an [interactive map] of that the 2016 data from that table, hope that helps
Cheap and quality labour probably
Median is an average, you mean mean
> Hard to believe Lithuania is better-off than Portugal
Euro + austerity does that to a country
Happy Independence day
I love your country
Joke of the year to this person right now
